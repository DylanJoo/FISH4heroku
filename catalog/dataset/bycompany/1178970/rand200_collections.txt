1178970_11_ITEM1_P5_S2	These loans generally have adjustable rates or shorter fixed terms and interest rates that are higher than the rates applicable to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P5_S3	However, these loans generally have a higher risk of loss than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	While the Bank s non-performing asset levels have been adversely impacted by the troubled residential real estate market and the challenging economic environment, the Bank continues to focus on conservative underwriting criteria and on aggressive collection efforts.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P7_S4	The Bank s focus on transaction accounts and expanded products and services has enabled the Bank to generate non-interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P7_S5	Fees derived from core deposit accounts are a primary source of non-interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P7_S6	The Bank also offers investment products and wealth and asset management services to generate non-interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P7_S7	Total non-interest income was $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, and fee income was $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $24.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Bank s lending activities, though concentrated in the communities surrounding its offices, extend predominantly throughout the State of New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Bank s eleven-county primary market area includes a mix of urban and suburban communities and has a diversified mix of industries including pharmaceutical and other manufacturing companies, network communications, insurance and financial services, and retail.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	According to the U.S. Census Bureau s most recent population data for 2010, the Bank s eleven-county market area has a population of 6.6 million, which was 74.3% of the state s total population.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Because of the diversity of industries in the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment trends in New Jersey during 2010 witnessed a decrease in the unemployment rate to 9.1% at December 31, 2010, compared to a rate of 10.1% at December 31, 2009.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Bank faces intense competition both in originating loans and attracting deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	The northern and central New Jersey market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits has come from the several commercial banks and savings banks in the market area, especially large regional banks which have obtained a major share of the available deposit market due in part to acquisitions and consolidations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S3	Many of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank and offer services that the Bank does not provide.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund industry and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S5	The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiary.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P14_S6	Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank s branch network, its deployment of branch and off-site ATMs, and its telephone and web-based banking services.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate and other consumer loans, generally located within its primary market area.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to standards that allow the sale of the loans to the secondary markets, primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA or Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC or Freddie Mac ).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	To manage interest rate risk, the Bank generally sells the 20-year and 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages that it originates.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The Bank retains a majority of the originated adjustable rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Generally, these loans have terms of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Bank historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and projects that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	During 2009 and 2010, the Bank significantly reduced construction loan originations due to adverse market conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P18_S3	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	In most cases, for the single family/condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P19_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Bank originates consumer loans that are secured, in most cases, by a borrower s assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by a first or second mortgage lien on the borrower s residence comprise the largest category of the Bank s consumer loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The Bank s consumer loan portfolio also includes marine loans made on an indirect basis that are secured by a first lien on recreational boats.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	The marine loans were generated via boat dealers located on the East Coast of the United States.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	The Bank curtailed its indirect marine lending in 2009 and discontinued indirect marine lending in 2010.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 61.7% were fixed-rate and 38.3% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P25_S3	The Bank has offered adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2 3 / 4 %, adjusting annually with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	Prior to September 30, 2008, the Company originated on a limited basis Alt-A mortgages in the form of stated income loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50%.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The balance of these Alt-A loans at December 31, 2010 was $14.7 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Residential loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S4	Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 25 years or less.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S5	The Bank retains the majority of the originated adjustable-rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S8	In 2010, $18.1 million, or 11.9% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S9	All of the loans sold in 2010 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P28_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $133.4 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $18.6 million for the past five years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including office buildings, multi-family apartment buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P30_S1	Commercial real estate loans were 36.1% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P30_S2	A substantial majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S3	The Bank performs more extensive diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S4	The Bank attempts to understand and control the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P34_S5	If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	For commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $750,000 and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank employs environmental experts to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Bank requires a full independent appraisal for commercial real estate.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	The appraiser must be selected from the Bank s approved list.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S3	The Bank also employs an independent review appraiser to ensure that the appraisal meets the Bank s standards.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S4	The underwriting guidelines generally provide that the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 75% of the appraised value and the debt service coverage should be at least 1.20 times.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S5	In addition, financial statements are required annually for review.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P35_S6	The Bank s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $1.0 million be completed at least every 18 months.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Bank s largest commercial mortgage loan as of December 31, 2010 was a $27.9 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a mixed-use project located in Jersey City, New Jersey, which consists of retail and residential space, along with a 950 space parking garage.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	The loan has a risk rating of 4 , (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality see discussion of the Bank s 9-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Bank underwrites loans secured by apartment buildings that have five or more units.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Bank considers multi-family lending a component of the commercial real estate lending portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The underwriting standards and procedures that are used to underwrite commercial real estate loans are used to underwrite multi-family loans, except the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property and the debt-service coverage should be a minimum of 1.15 times.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Bank originates commercial construction loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P39_S1	Commercial construction lending includes both new construction of residential and commercial real estate projects and the reconstruction of existing structures.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P39_S2	The Bank s commercial construction financing takes two forms: projects for sale (single family/condominiums) and projects that are constructed for investment purposes (rental property).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P39_S3	To mitigate the speculative nature of construction loans, the Bank generally requires significant pre-leasing on rental properties and requires that a percentage of the single-family residences or condominiums be under contract to support construction loan advances.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P73_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P73_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P75_S2	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P75_S3	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P76_S1	The policy statement provides updated guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P76_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P76_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2010, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described above.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S12	The first loan is secured by a planned unit development of 203 single family detached townhouse and age restricted units that was written down to its current estimated collateral value of $6.2 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S13	The second is a commercial mortgage loan secured by a 184-unit, age-restricted townhouse project of which 126 units remained unsold.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S14	This loan was written down to its current estimated collateral value of $3.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S15	There is no contractual commitment to advance additional funds to this borrower.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S16	Non-performing construction loans decreased $3.8 million, to $9.4 million at December 31, 2010, from $13.2 million at December 31, 2009, as a result of repayments and a foreclosure.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S17	At December 31, 2010, non-performing construction loans consisted of a $9.4 million senior participation interest in a $283.0 million SNC.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S18	Proceeds from this construction loan facility are being used to convert an existing 35-story, 631,000 square foot office building in New York City into a mixed-use 346-unit residential condominium and 251-room hotel.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S19	The project has been impacted by additional costs and a decline in sales activity.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S20	While this loan has been classified as non-accrual, the hotel was completed and began operations in 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S21	The loan was current as to the payment of principal and interest at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S22	The Company had no unfunded commitments on this loan at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S23	At December 31, 2010, the Company held $2.9 million of foreclosed assets, compared with $6.4 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S24	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2010 are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S25	Foreclosed assets consisted of $1.1 million of commercial real estate, $1.1 million of residential properties, and $0.7 million of marine vessels at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S26	Non-performing assets totaled $100.1 million, or 1.47% of total assets at December 31, 2010, compared to $90.9 million, or 1.33% of total assets at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P81_S27	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $4.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P82_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	loans this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	The factors considered in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the following:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	duration and breadth of the current business cycle.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S1	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S2	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S3	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S4	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S5	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S6	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval process.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P87_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	Each quarter the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Credit Administration Officer.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P88_S5	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type, as well as qualitative and environmental factors such as:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	effects of changes in credit concentration.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P89_S2	In the second quarter of 2010, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P89_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the marine loan portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S3	As a result of this process, management has established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S4	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is warranted based on factors such as the geographic concentration of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the losses inherent in commercial lending, as these types of loans are typically riskier than residential mortgages.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S5	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a continued decline in the economy, generally, a continued decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S6	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S7	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S8	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S9	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S10	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P91_S11	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P93_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P93_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P93_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the investment policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit participation in hedging programs, interest rate swaps, options or futures transactions or the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with guidelines that have been established for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P94_S8	The investment strategy also considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	Acceptable investment securities include U. S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P98_S2	If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P98_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	The market value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P99_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	The current turmoil in the credit markets has resulted in a lack of liquidity in the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S7	Additionally, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S9	At December 31, 2010, the Bank held $93.7 million in privately-issued CMO s in the investment portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P102_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P127_S1	The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the deposit insurer.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P127_S2	The Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P127_S4	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P127_S5	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P128_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations and stockholders.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P129_S1	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P129_S2	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P130_S0	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P131_S0	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P131_S1	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.

1178970_11_ITEM1_P131_S3	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P131_S4	See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P132_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P132_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P132_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P133_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P133_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P133_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P134_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P134_S1	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P134_S2	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P135_S0	unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P136_S0	FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P136_S1	The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P136_S2	Tier 1 capital is comprised of:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P137_S0	minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P138_S0	Tier 2 capital is comprised of:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P139_S0	up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P139_S1	The allowance for loan losses may be includible in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P139_S2	Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P140_S0	The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition, with a rating of 1 (the highest examination rating of the FDIC for banks) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth, of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P140_S1	For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S0	The FDIC regulations also establish a risk-based capital standard.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S1	The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S2	In determining the amount of a bank s risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S3	The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing such bank s capital adequacy.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S4	Under such a risk assessment, examiners will evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P141_S5	According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P142_S0	the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P142_S1	Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to maintain additional capital.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P142_S2	The following table shows the Bank s leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2010:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P143_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P143_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P143_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P144_S0	On October 14, 2008, the Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ) was announced by the Treasury Department as part of the Troubled Assets Relief Program, referred to as TARP .
1178970_11_ITEM1_P144_S1	Under the CPP, an eligible financial institution could apply to the U.S. government to issue senior preferred shares to the Treasury in aggregate amounts between 1% and 3% of the institution s risk-weighted assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P144_S2	The Company was eligible to apply for an investment by the Treasury of between $40.1 million and $120.4 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P144_S3	The Company did not make an application to participate in the CPP.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P145_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P145_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P145_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P146_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Board ( FHFB ).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S2	The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P147_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2010, dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $1.8 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P148_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank were insured generally up to a maximum of $100,000 for each separately insured depositor, and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P148_S1	In October 2008, however, the FDIC temporarily increased the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance available on all deposit accounts to $250,000.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P148_S2	That limit was made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P148_S3	Additionally, certain non-interest-bearing transaction accounts maintained with financial institutions participating in the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLG Program ) were fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until June 30, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P148_S4	The FDIC implemented the TLG Program on November 21, 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P149_S0	The FDIC imposes an assessment against financial institutions for deposit insurance.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P149_S1	This assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and prior to 2009, ranged from 5 to 43 basis points of the institution s deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P149_S2	On February 27, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule raising the deposit insurance assessment rates to a range from 12 to 45 basis points.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P149_S3	The rule became effective as of April 1, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P149_S4	The rule provided for certain adjustments to the rate that effectively made the range up to 77.5 basis points.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P150_S0	The Company participated in the FDIC s Temporary Account Guarantee ( TAG ) program which expired on December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P150_S1	Under the TAG, funds in non-interest bearing accounts, in interest-bearing transaction accounts with interest rates of 0.50% or less, and in Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts had a temporary unlimited guarantee from the FDIC until June 30, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P150_S2	The coverage under the TAG was in addition to and separate from the standard coverage available under the FDIC s general deposit insurance rules, which insure accounts up to $250,000.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P150_S3	The TLG Program also guaranteed newly issued senior secured debt of banks, thrifts and certain holding companies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P150_S4	The Company had no outstanding debt guaranteed under the TLG program at December 31, 2009 or 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P151_S0	On May 22, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P151_S1	The amount of the special assessment for any institution did not exceed 10 basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P151_S2	The Bank paid this special assessment in the amount of $3.1 million on September 30, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P152_S0	On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a rule that required depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P152_S1	These assessments were payable on December 30, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P152_S2	The total prepaid assessment of $31.3 million was remitted to the FDIC on that date.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P152_S3	Of that amount, $27.4 million was recorded as a prepaid asset as of December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P152_S4	Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded an expense for its regular assessment for each quarter, with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset until it is fully expensed.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P153_S0	On November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule which revises its deposit insurance regulations to include noninterest-bearing transaction accounts as a new temporary deposit insurance category.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P154_S0	As defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, noninterest-bearing accounts include only such demand deposit or checking accounts that provide for unlimited transfers and withdrawals at any time, and which are maintained by individuals, businesses, or other types of depositors.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P154_S1	The funds maintained in such accounts are insured without limit, with such coverage being separate from coverage provided to depositors for all other accounts maintained at an insured institution.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P154_S2	This rule became effective on December 31, 2010 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S0	On December 15, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule which sets the insurance funds designated reserve ratio (DRR) at 2% of estimated insured deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S1	As directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is required to set a DRR annually, and must consider the following factors when doing so: the risk of loss to the insurance fund, economic conditions affecting the banking industry, prevention of sharp swings in assessment rates, and such other factors deemed important.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S2	The rule became effective on January 1, 2011.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S3	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that establishes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S4	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S5	The rule also changes the assessment base from a bank s adjusted domestic deposits to its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S6	The rule is effective on April 1, 2011.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P155_S7	This change in methodology is not expected to materially affect the Bank s cost of deposit insurance.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P156_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P156_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P157_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P157_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P157_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P158_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P159_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P159_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P160_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P161_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P161_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P161_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P162_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P162_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P163_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P164_S0	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P164_S1	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P165_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P166_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P166_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P166_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P166_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P167_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P168_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P168_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of May 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P168_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P168_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P169_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P169_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P170_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P170_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P170_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P170_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P171_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P171_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P171_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P171_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P172_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P173_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P174_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P174_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P175_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P176_S0	An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P177_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P177_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P177_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P177_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P178_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P179_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P180_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P181_S0	lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P182_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P182_S1	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P183_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act broadens the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to the average consolidated assets less average tangible capital of a financial institution.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P183_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor, and provides unlimited deposit insurance through January 1, 2013 for non-interest bearing demand transaction activities at all insured depository institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P184_S0	Effective one year after the date of enactment is a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that repeals the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P184_S1	Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have increased interest expense at depository institutions like the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act will require publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P185_S1	The Securities and Exchange Commission has been authorized to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P185_S2	The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P186_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P186_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P187_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P187_S1	Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P188_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P189_S0	other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P190_S0	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P190_S1	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P191_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P192_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P192_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P193_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P193_S1	The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $10.7 million and up to $58.8 million, subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board, and an initial reserve of $1.4 million plus 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $55.8 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P193_S2	The first $10.7 million of otherwise reservable balances, subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board, are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P193_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P193_S4	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P194_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P195_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P195_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P195_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted to various aspects of internet banking, and have indicated their intention to reevaluate their regulations to ensure that they encourage banks efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P195_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P196_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P196_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P196_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S6	As of December 31, 2010, the Company s total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P197_S7	The following table shows the Company s Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2010:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P198_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P198_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P198_S2	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P199_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P199_S1	That will eliminate the inclusion of certain instruments from tier 1 capital, such as trust preferred securities, that are currently includable for bank holding companies.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P199_S2	Any instruments issued by May 19, 2012 by holding companies of less than $15 billion in assets (as of December 31, 2009) are grandfathered.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P200_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P200_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine and requires the issuance of implementing regulations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P200_S2	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P200_S3	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P201_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P201_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not qualify as a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P202_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P203_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P204_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify as a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P204_S1	The Company has not elected to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations, although it may seek to do so in the future.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P204_S2	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if:
1178970_11_ITEM1_P205_S0	the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to become a financial holding company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P206_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P206_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P207_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P207_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P207_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P208_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P209_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P209_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P210_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P210_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P210_S2	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P210_S3	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P210_S4	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P211_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P211_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P212_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2010 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P213_S6	At December 31, 2010, the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $21.2 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P214_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_11_ITEM1_P214_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P214_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P215_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P215_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P216_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P216_S1	At December 31, 2010, the Company had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P216_S2	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P217_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P217_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P218_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P218_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of taxable income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P218_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P218_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the New Jersey Director of the Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_11_ITEM1_P218_S4	As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and a franchise tax to the State of Delaware.

1178970_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Declines in home prices, increases in foreclosures and unemployment have adversely impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans, resulting in the write-down of asset values.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The continuing housing slump has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing, further declines in home prices, and increased delinquencies on construction, residential and commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The ongoing concern about the stability of the financial markets in general has caused many lenders to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These conditions may also cause a further reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S2	A worsening of these negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our strategy continues to be to increase our commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S4	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P3_S5	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	for a commercial mortgage loan was $2.1 million, and for a commercial loan was $398,000, compared to an average loan size of $204,000 for a single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P5_S2	The local economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, including an unemployment rate of 8.2% at December 31, 2010, have a significant impact on our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and residential mortgage loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P5_S3	A continuing significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, further declines in real estate values and the continued slump in real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	These small- to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Our Allowance for Loan Losses May Not be Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Could Decrease Our borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	We may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our emphasis on the continued diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We Hold Certain Intangible Assets That Could Be Classified As Impaired in the Future.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	If These Assets Are Considered to Be Either Partially or Fully Impaired in The Future, Our Earnings Could Decline We record all assets and liabilities acquired by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	At December 31, 2010, goodwill totaling $346.3 million is not amortized but is subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P8_S4	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The goodwill impairment test is performed in two steps.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P11_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or core deposit intangible assets, or both.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and core deposit intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S5	Continued or Further Declines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require an Other-Then-Temporary Impairment Charge, Which Would Reduce Our Earnings Our securities portfolio includes securities that have declined in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the financial sector in general and the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S6	These securities include private label mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S7	A prolonged decline in the value of these securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P13_S8	The potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be more active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended, particularly with respect to the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may increase our Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums and may also increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P14_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Laws and Regulations We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a bank holding company, Provident Financial Services, Inc. is subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P16_S2	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on The Provident Bank , Provident Financial Services, Inc., and our operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Financial Reform Legislation Will, Among Other Things, Create a New Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Tighten Capital Standards and Result in New Laws and Regulations That Are Expected to Increase Our Costs of Operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Banks such as our bank with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Effective July 2011, The Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	Depending on competitive responses, the significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance assessments.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated assets less tangible capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P22_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions to $250,000 per depositor, and provides unlimited deposit insurance through January 1, 2013 for non-interest bearing demand transaction activities at all insured depository institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse affect on net interest income to the extent our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or at different relative interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in our average interest rate spread and net interest income, which would have a negative effect on our profitability.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S3	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 6.1% or $13.3 million.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S6	At December 31, 2010, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.38 billion.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S8	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P24_S9	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to reduce borrowing costs.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments are not available to reinvest at prevailing market rates at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Strong Competition Within Our Market Area May Limit Our Growth and Profitability Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In particular, over the past decade, New Jersey has experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S6	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S7	Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S8	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S9	Lack of Consumer Confidence in Financial Institutions May Decrease Our Level of Deposits Our level of deposits may be affected by lack of consumer confidence in financial institutions, which has caused fewer depositors to be willing to maintain deposits that are not insured by the FDIC.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S10	That may cause depositors to withdraw deposits and place them in other institutions or to invest uninsured funds in investments perceived as being more secure, such as securities issued by the United States Treasury.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P25_S11	These consumer preferences may cause us to be forced to pay higher interest rates to retain deposits and may constrain liquidity as we seek to meet funding needs caused by reduced deposit levels.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We rely on communications and information systems to conduct our business.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Any failure, interruption or compromise in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our business operations.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security compromise of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security compromise will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.
1178970_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security compromise of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_11_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Bank conducted business through 81 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate net book value of premises and equipment was $74.3 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the first quarter of 2011, the Company s executive offices were relocated to a leased facility which also houses the Bank s Main Office at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM2_P0_S3	This was necessitated by the pending relocation of the Bank s administrative offices from 830 Bergen Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey to a leased facility at 100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM2_P0_S4	The Bank expects to complete the relocation of its administrative offices during the second quarter 2011.
1178970_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.

1178970_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company s Board of Directors intends to review the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, subject to financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, industry standards, economic conditions, regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and other relevant factors.
1178970_11_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock.
1178970_11_ITEM5_P1_S3	If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or immediately preceding year.

1178970_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a stock-chartered bank.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 81 full-service branches throughout northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	The Bank, established in 1839, is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2010, commercial loans accounted for 55.6% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 44.4%.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending relationships.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	Core deposits, consisting of all savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	At December 31, 2010, core deposits were 73.8% of total deposits.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P8_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P10_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P11_S7	A sample of risk ratings are also reviewed and confirmed through the Loan Review function and periodically, by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval process.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type and other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries, loan volume, as well as, the national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P12_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P12_S2	In the second quarter of 2010, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P12_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the marine portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P13_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P14_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	The Company engages an independent third party to perform an annual analysis as of September 30, or more frequently if necessary, to test the aggregate balance of goodwill for impairment.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	The fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination and uses standard valuation methodologies.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P15_S3	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of the goodwill on the financial statements of the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	The first step in the process is estimating the fair value of the Reporting Unit.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The first step utilizes four standard valuation methodologies common to valuation in business combination transactions involving financial institutions were used: (1) the Public Market Peers approach based on the trading prices of similar publicly traded companies as measured by standard valuation ratios; (2) the Comparable Transactions approach based on pricing ratios recently paid in the sale or merger of comparable banking franchises; (3) the Control Premium approach based on the Company s trading price (a proxy for the Bank s market pricing ratios were it publicly traded) followed by the application of an industry based control premium; and (4) the Discounted Cash Flow ( DCF ) approach where value is estimated based on the present value of projected dividends and a terminal value.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	These valuation techniques take into account the Bank s recent operating history, current operating environment and future prospects.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	In addition, these valuation techniques are prepared utilizing a GAAP established fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2 measurements, which utilize quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly and Level 3 measurements, which are the lowest priority to unobservable inputs and supported by little or no market activity.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	The Public Market Peers approach and the Comparable Transactions approach are based on Level 2 inputs.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	The Control Premium approach is based on a combination of Level 1 inputs (the quoted price for the Company s common stock) and Level 2 inputs (an estimated control premium based on comparable transactions).
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	The DCF approach is based on Level 3 inputs including projections of future operations based on assumptions derived from management, the experience of the independent valuation firm that conducted the analysis and information from publicly available sources.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	All approaches are considered in the final estimate of fair value, with the approaches weighted based upon their applicability based upon the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	These approaches and the resulting fair value conclusions are consistent with standard valuation techniques used by other market participants in evaluating business combinations for financial institutions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	Significant assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the Reporting Unit using the Public Market Peers, Comparable Transactions, and Control Premium approaches included the comparability of the selected regional and national peers, subjective adjustments for variations in franchise value and credit risk versus peers, and adjustments for projected market trends.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S7	In addition, assumptions are made in the use of the DCF approach regarding projections of future free cash flow resulting from asset growth, profitability, dividend payouts, and non-cash expenses.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P19_S8	All of these assumptions may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, regulation and legislation, and competition.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	For purposes of the most recent impairment evaluation performed as of September 30, 2010, it was assumed that external factors would remain consistent with the then current environment.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	If the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	As reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and an impairment charge in the amount of $152.5 million was recognized as of March 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	The annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2010 was completed in the fourth quarter of 2010, with no further impairment indicated based on the step one analysis.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The step one analysis at September 30, 2010 indicated that the fair value of the Reporting Unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 27.5%.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P23_S1	At September 30, 2010, the carrying value of goodwill was $346.3 million.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P23_S2	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P23_S3	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P24_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P24_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P24_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The market value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	In this evaluation, the Company recognized other-than-temporary securities impairment losses in earnings totaling $170,000, $2.0 million and $1.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carryback years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	A valuation reserve of $1.1 million was established in 2009 pertaining primarily to state tax benefits on net operating losses at the Bank and unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P30_S2	The valuation allowance remains at $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P30_S3	A valuation reserve of $1.7 million that had been established in 2007 pertaining primarily to state tax benefits on net operating losses at the Bank was eliminated in 2008 due to a large dividend payment the Bank received from a subsidiary, which reduced the state net operating losses to zero at December 31, 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P31_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P31_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P31_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P31_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P35_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P35_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 Total assets decreased $11.6 million, or 0.2%, to $6.82 billion at December 31, 2010, from $6.84 billion at December 31, 2009, due primarily to decreases in cash and other assets, which were partially offset by increases in investment securities and loans.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	Cash and cash equivalents decreased $71.5 million, to $52.2 million at December 31, 2010, from $123.7 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Company utilized these funds to repay higher-costing maturing certificates of deposit and borrowings, purchase investment securities and originate loans retained for portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P36_S3	Total investments increased $60.7 million, or 3.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Securities purchases for the year ended December 31, 2010 consisted primarily of U.S. Government Agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	Total loans increased $25.6 million, or 0.6%, to $4.41 billion at December 31, 2010, from $4.38 billion at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2010, loan originations totaling $1.14 billion and loan purchases of $90.4 million were partially offset by repayments of $1.15 billion and loan sales of $18.1 million.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P37_S3	Multi-family loans increased $159.5 million to $387.2 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $227.7 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P37_S4	Commercial real estate loans increased $90.2 million to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $1.09 billion at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	repayments attributable to an active refinance market outpaced originations.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	One- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations totaled $152.0 million and one- to four-family residential mortgage loans purchased totaled $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	Principal repayments on residential mortgage loans totaled $327.4 million, and residential mortgage loans sold totaled $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	Construction loans decreased $70.7 million to $125.2 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $195.9 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S4	The Company has de-emphasized construction lending for the past two years due to adverse market conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S5	Commercial loans decreased $30.3 million to $755.5 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $785.8 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S6	Consumer loans decreased $16.9 million to $569.6 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $586.5 million at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S7	Commercial loans, consisting of commercial real estate, multi-family, construction and commercial loans, totaled $2.45 billion, accounting for 55.6% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2010, compared to $2.30 billion, or 52.5% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P38_S8	The Company intends to continue to focus on the origination of commercially-oriented loans.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Retail loans, which consist of one- to four-family residential mortgage and consumer loans, such as fixed-rate home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $1.96 billion and accounted for 44.4% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2010, compared to $2.08 billion, or 47.5%, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was a result of growth in the multi-family and commercial mortgage portfolios, coupled with reductions in retail loans attributable to refinance activity, the market preference for longer-term fixed-rate loans, which the Company chooses to sell rather than retain for portfolio as part of its interest rate risk management process, and lack of qualified retail loan demand.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Prior to September 30, 2008, the Company originated Alt-A mortgages in the form of stated income loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% on a limited basis.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	The balance of these Alt-A loans at December 31, 2010 was $14.7 million.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	Of this total, 8 loans totaling $2.9 million were 90 days or more delinquent.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	General valuation reserves of 10%, or $293,000, were allocated to these loans at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company participates in loans originated by other banks, including participations designated as Shared National Credits ( SNC ).
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The Company s gross commitments and outstanding balances as a participant in SNCs were $106.9 million and $76.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company s participations in SNCs included five relationships classified as substandard (rated 7) under the Company s loan risk rating system with gross commitments of $49.4 million and outstanding balances of $48.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S3	Of these adversely classified SNCs, four loan relationships consisted of commercial construction loans on properties located in New York City and New Jersey, and one was a commercial loan to a Pennsylvania media company.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S4	All of the Company s SNC participations were current as to the payment of principal and interest as of December 31, 2010, with the exception of one $4.3 million commercial mortgage loan for which payments had been received but were unapplied at December 31, 2010, while the terms of an extension were negotiated among lending participants.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S5	This loan was subsequently extended and principal and interest were paid current.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P42_S6	The Company had outstanding junior lien mortgages totaling $297.6 million at December 31, 2010.

1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	The basic and diluted loss per share was $2.16 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.74 for 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	The primary reason for the net loss in 2009 was the recognition of a $152.5 million goodwill impairment charge.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	The goodwill impairment charge was a non-cash accounting adjustment to the Company s financial statements which did not affect cash flows, liquidity, or tangible capital.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S5	As goodwill is excluded from regulatory capital, the impairment charge did not impact the regulatory capital ratios of the Company or its wholly owned subsidiary, The Provident Bank, both of which remained well-capitalized under then current regulatory requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S6	Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared with 2008 also reflected an increase in the provision for loan losses due to the following: an increase in non-performing loans; downgrades in credit risk ratings; an increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio; and the impact of current macroeconomic conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S7	The provision for loan losses was $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $15.1 million for 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S8	In addition, earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by a special assessment imposed on the banking industry by the FDIC as part of its plan to restore the deposit insurance fund.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P51_S9	The cost of this special assessment to the Company was $3.1 million, which resulted in a charge of $1.9 million, net of tax, recognized during the second quarter of 2009.

1178970_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the yield on average earning assets, partially offset by an increase in average earning asset balances.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P52_S5	The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 55 basis points to 4.95% for 2009, from 5.50% for 2008, with reductions in yields experienced in all earning asset classes.

1178970_11_ITEM7_P52_S21	The increase in the provision for loan losses was attributable to an increase in non-performing loans; downgrades in credit risk ratings; an increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio to 52.5% at December 31, 2009, from 46.5% at December 31, 2008; and the impact of macroeconomic conditions.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P52_S22	Net charge-offs for 2009 were $17.2 million, compared to $8.2 million for 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P52_S23	Total charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $19.6 million, compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	Other operating expenses increased $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to $1.3 million of charges related to the consolidation and divestiture of premises and costs associated with the dissolution of a real estate development joint venture.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S5	Compensation and benefits expense increased $968,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with 2008, primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in severance costs during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S6	Severance included costs associated with the retirements of two senior executives in the third quarter of 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S7	These increases were partially offset by a $966,000 decrease in the amortization of intangibles as a result of scheduled reductions in core deposit amortization, and reductions in net occupancy expense totaling $639,000.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S8	For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company s income tax expense was $7.0 million, compared with $14.9 million for 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S9	The decrease in income tax expense was attributable to lower pre-tax income and a lower effective tax rate.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S10	Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge recognized in the first quarter of 2009, which is not tax deductible, the Company s effective tax rate was 18.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with 26.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P53_S11	The reduction in the effective tax rate was attributable to a larger proportion of the Company s income being derived from tax-exempt sources.
1178970_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its depositors, to fund loans and securities purchases, deposit outflows and operating expenses.

1178970_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets and liabilities, earnings and capital.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal funds rate or LIBOR.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Investment securities purchases generally have maturities of five years or less, and mortgage-backed securities have weighted average lives initially between three and five years.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The management Asset/Liability Committee meets on a monthly basis to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income and economic value of equity.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Members of the Asset/Liability Committee include the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other senior officers from the Bank s finance, lending, credit and customer management departments.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core-funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 26.2% at December 31, 2010 compared to 30.8% at December 31, 2009.

1178970_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitively priced within the marketplace, typically within the upper quartile of rates offered by competitors.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P5_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2010, in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 6.1%, or $13.3 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P8_S2	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 2.0%, or $4.5 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2010, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 20.6%, or $234.8 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P9_S3	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 5.6%, or $63.9 million increase in the present value of equity.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_11_ITEM7A_P10_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company ) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P3_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of evaluating other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as of April 1, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P4_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Provident Financial Services, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.:
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) .
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P6_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S4	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P7_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P8_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P9_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), The Provident Bank (the Bank ) and their wholly owned subsidiaries.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P11_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P13_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P15_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P15_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P16_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P16_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P16_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	To determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P22_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives, of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P26_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P29_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P29_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P30_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P30_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	(generally 25 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P34_S1	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P35_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s Wealth Management Group) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P38_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P38_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30, and the impairment test at September 30, 2010 indicated that there was no impairment.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P40_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P40_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	On April 1, 2003, the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S4	Expense related to stock options is based on the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the options.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P45_S5	Expense related to stock awards is based on the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P46_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P46_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P46_S3	These accounts will be liquidated as shares are distributed from the DDFP in accordance with the plan document.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P46_S4	At December 31, 2010, there were 428,003 shares held by the DDFP.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Bank provides postretirement health care and life insurance plans to certain of its employees.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	The life insurance coverage is noncontributory to the participant.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	Participants contribute to the cost of medical coverage based on the employee s length of service with the Bank.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	On December 31, 2002, the Bank eliminated postretirement healthcare benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Other comprehensive income includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in the Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing to its customers traditional banking and other financial services.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	These potentially dilutive shares would then be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance temporarily delaying the effective date of additional disclosures about troubled debt restructurings.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	The delay is intended to allow the FASB time to complete its deliberations on what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	The effective date of the new disclosures about troubled debt restructurings for public entities and the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring will then be coordinated.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	The deferral is effective upon issuance.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued guidance to enhance the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	As a result of this guidance, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S2	The disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S3	The disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S4	The amendments in this guidance encourage, but do not require, comparative disclosures for earlier reporting periods that ended before initial adoption.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S5	However, an entity should provide comparative disclosures for those reporting periods ending after initial adoption.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P57_S6	The adoption of this guidance is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2010.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	In April 2010, the FASB issued guidance under which modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool do not result in the removal of those loans from the pool even if the modification of those loans would otherwise be considered a troubled debt restructuring.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	An entity will continue to be required to consider whether the pool of assets in which the loan is included is impaired if expected cash flows for the pool change.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	update became effective for the Company for the interim reporting period beginning after June 15, 2010 and did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that will require more robust disclosures about: the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value; the valuation techniques and inputs used; the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements; and the transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	The disclosure requirements relating to Level 3 measurements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	All other requirements of this guidance are effective in interim and annual periods beginning after December 31, 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S4	The adoption of the required components of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S5	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted the amended guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S6	This guidance affects all entities and enterprises currently within its scope, as well as qualifying special purpose entities that were previously outside of its scope, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, with early adoption prohibited.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P59_S7	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or financial statement disclosures.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	Upon completion of the plan of conversion, a liquidation account was established in an amount equal to the total equity of the Bank as of the latest practicable date prior to the conversion.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	The liquidation account was established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the Bank to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders as defined in the Plan, who continue to maintain deposits in the Bank after the conversion.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P61_S4	In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event, each eligible account holder and supplemental eligible account holder would receive a liquidation distribution, prior to any payment to the holder of the Bank s common stock.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P73_S6	The following table represents the Company s disclosure on securities available for sale with temporary impairment (in thousands):
1178970_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P74_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P74_S3	The Company does not have the intent to sell securities in a temporary loss position at December 31, 2010, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company estimates the loss projections for each security by stressing the individual loans collateralizing the security and applying a range of expected default rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds in conjunction with the underlying credit enhancement for each security.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2010.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P79_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $97,264,000 and $84,477,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P79_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2010, or 2009.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P79_S3	If the nonaccrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $4,114,000, $2,430,000 and $2,255,000, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P80_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	As of December 31, 2010, there were 24 impaired loans totaling $47.7 million.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Included in this total were 6 TDRs to 5 borrowers totaling $7.6 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2010.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	or (2) if loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) market price of the loan.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans can be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P83_S3	Loans receivable summarized by portfolio segment and impairment method is as follows (in thousands): The allowance for loan losses is summarized by portfolio segment and impairment classification as follows (in thousands): The activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows (in thousands):

1178970_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $474,208,000 and $517,624,000, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $258,012,000 and $250,269,000, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively), exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P90_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	Collateral and/or guarantees are required for virtually all loans.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar characteristics.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P91_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00%; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P143_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P145_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P146_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P146_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P153_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.

1178970_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	The fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination and uses standard valuation methodologies.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $152.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 The fair value of performing loans is estimated using a combination of techniques, including discounting estimated future cash flows and quoted market prices of similar instruments, where available.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans is based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, is equal to the amount payable on demand.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P171_S2	The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P171_S3	The fair value of borrowed funds is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P171_S4	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are deemed immaterial.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P4_S1	The Bank is a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 82 full-service branch offices in the New Jersey counties of Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union, which the Bank considers its primary market area.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P4_S2	The Bank emphasizes personal service and customer convenience in serving the financial needs of the individuals, families and businesses residing in its markets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P4_S3	The Bank attracts deposits from the general public and businesses primarily in the areas surrounding its banking offices and uses those funds, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, to originate commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P4_S4	The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed securities and other permissible investments.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following are highlights of The Provident Bank s operations: Diversified Loan Portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	To improve asset yields and reduce its exposure to interest rate risk, the Bank diversifies its loan portfolio by originating commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	These loans generally have adjustable rates or shorter fixed terms and interest rates that are higher than the rates applicable to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	However, these loans generally have a higher risk of loss than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2011, non-performing assets were $135.4 million or 1.91% of total assets, compared to $100.1 million or 1.47% of total assets at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P5_S5	While the Bank s non-performing asset levels have been adversely impacted by the troubled real estate market and the challenging economic environment, the Bank continues to focus on conservative underwriting criteria and on active and timely collection efforts.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	Emphasis on Relationship Banking and Core Deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Bank emphasizes the acquisition and retention of core deposit accounts, such as checking and savings accounts, and expanding customer relationships.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	Core deposit accounts totaled $4.03 billion at December 31, 2011, representing 78.1% of total deposits, compared with $3.60 billion, or 73.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S3	The Bank also focuses on increasing the number of households and businesses served and the number of bank products per customer.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S4	The Bank s focus on transaction accounts and expanded products and services has enabled the Bank to generate non-interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S5	Fees derived from core deposit accounts are a primary source of non-interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S6	The Bank also offers investment products and wealth and asset management services through its subsidiaries to generate non-interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P6_S7	Total non-interest income was $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and fee income was $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared with $23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Bank manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the origination and retention of adjustable rate and shorter-term loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, the Bank uses its investments in securities to manage interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	At December 31, 2011, 45.2% of the Bank s loan portfolio had a term to maturity of one year or less, or had adjustable interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P7_S3	Moreover, at December 31, 2011, the Bank s securities portfolio totaled $1.76 billion and had an expected average life of 3.00 years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	MARKET AREA The Company and the Bank are headquartered in Jersey City, which is located in Hudson County, New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	1 in Mercer, 25 in Middlesex, 10 in Monmouth, 10 in Morris, 4 in Ocean, 1 in Passaic, 4 in Somerset and 3 in Union Counties.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Bank also maintains its administrative offices in Iselin, New Jersey and satellite Loan Production offices in Convent Station and Princeton, New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Bank s lending activities, though concentrated in the communities surrounding its offices, extend predominantly throughout the State of New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P9_S3	The Bank s eleven-county primary market area includes a mix of urban and suburban communities and has a diversified mix of industries including pharmaceutical and other manufacturing companies, network communications, insurance and financial services, and retail.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P9_S4	According to the U.S. Census Bureau s most recent population data for 2011, the Bank s eleven-county market area has a population of 6.6 million, which was 74.6% of the state s total population.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Because of the diversity of industries in the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in New Jersey remained elevated at 9.1% at December 31, 2011, unchanged from December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	Within its eleven-county market area, the Bank had an approximate 6.29% share of bank deposits as of June 30, 2011, the latest date for which statistics are available, and an approximate 1.96% deposit share of the New Jersey market statewide.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	The Bank faces intense competition both in originating loans and attracting deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	The northern and central New Jersey market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits has come from the several commercial banks and savings banks in the market area, especially large regional banks which have obtained a major share of the available deposit market due in part to acquisitions and consolidations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Many of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank and offer services that the Bank does not provide.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund industry and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S5	The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiary.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P12_S6	Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank s branch network, its deployment of branch and off-site ATMs, and its telephone and web-based banking services.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate and other consumer loans, for borrowers generally located within its primary market area.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to standards that allow the sale of the loans to the secondary markets, primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA or Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC or Freddie Mac ).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	To manage interest rate risk, the Bank generally sells the 20-year and 30-year fixed-rate residential mortgages that it originates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	The Bank retains a majority of the originated adjustable rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	Generally, these loans have terms of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Bank historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	During 2010 and 2011, the Bank significantly reduced for sale construction loan originations due to adverse market conditions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P16_S3	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	In most cases, for the single family/condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P17_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Bank originates consumer loans that are secured, in most cases, by a borrower s assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by a first or second mortgage lien on the borrower s residence comprise the largest category of the Bank s consumer loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Bank s consumer loan portfolio also includes marine loans made on an indirect basis that are secured by a first lien on recreational boats.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	The marine loans were generated via boat dealers located on the East Coast of the United States.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S4	The Bank discontinued indirect marine lending in 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P18_S5	Marine loans are currently made on a direct, limited accommodation basis to existing customers.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	Commercial loans are loans to businesses of varying size and type within the Bank s market.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Bank lends to established businesses, and the loans are generally secured by business assets such as equipment, receivables, inventory, real estate or marketable securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	On a limited basis, the Bank makes unsecured commercial loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	Most commercial lines of credit are made on a floating interest rate basis and most term loans are made on a fixed interest rate basis, usually with terms of five years or less.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	Set forth below is selected information concerning the composition of the loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages (after deductions for deferred fees and costs, unearned discounts and premiums and allowances for losses) as of the dates indicated.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2011, regarding the maturities of loans in the loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P20_S1	Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayment and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due within one year.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The following table sets forth at December 31, 2011, the dollar amount of all fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans due after December 31, 2012.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Bank originates residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences, generally located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Bank originates residential mortgages primarily through commissioned mortgage representatives, the Internet and its branch offices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P22_S2	The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P22_S3	As of December 31, 2011, $1.31 billion or 28.6% of the total portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P22_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 63.9% were fixed-rate and 36.1% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	The Bank has offered adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2 3 / 4 %, adjusting annually with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	Prior to September 30, 2008, the Company originated on a limited basis Alt-A mortgages in the form of stated income loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50%.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	The balance of these Alt-A loans at December 31, 2011 was $11.3 million.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	Residential loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 25 years or less.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S5	The Bank retains the majority of the originated adjustable-rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S8	In 2011, $12.9 million, or 8.8% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S9	All of the loans sold in 2011 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P26_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P27_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $105.7 million.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P27_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $13.7 million for the past five years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including office buildings, multi-family apartment buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	Commercial real estate loans were 27.4% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	A substantial majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P32_S3	The Bank performs more extensive diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P32_S4	The Bank attempts to understand and mitigate the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than residential mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower s business.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the risk assessment of its loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	The Bank s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The collection procedures for Federal Housing Association ( FHA ) and Veteran s Administration ( VA ) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection guidelines outlined by those agencies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P68_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for modified loans previously discussed.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	As of December 31, 2011, there were 65 impaired loans totaling $103.2 million.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P72_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P72_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P72_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P72_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	The policy statement provides updated guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P75_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P75_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2011, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described above.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	in construction loans and $8.5 million in consumer loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	At that same date, loans classified as doubtful totaled $0.1 million, consisting solely of commercial loans.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	There were ten troubled debt restructured loans which totaled $24.3 million and classified as non-accrual at December 31, 2011; no troubled debt restructurings were non-accrual at any of the prior year periods.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans increased $13.4 million, to $29.5 million at December 31, 2011, from $16.1 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	At December 31, 2011, the Company held 13 non-performing commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	The largest non-performing commercial mortgage loan was a $13.4 million loan secured by a first mortgage on a 200,000 square foot office/industrial building located in Eatontown, New Jersey, which has been negatively impacted by the loss of a major tenant that relied upon contracts with the Federal Government.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S3	The loan has been restructured and payments are current at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S4	The borrower continues to make efforts to lease the property.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S5	There is no contractual commitment to advance additional funds to this borrower.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S8	The largest non-performing commercial loan relationship consisted of four loans to a power systems manufacturer with total outstanding balances of $9.1 million at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S9	All contractual payments on these loans, based upon modified terms, were current at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S10	Non-performing construction loans increased $1.6 million, to $11.0 million at December 31, 2011, from $9.4 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S11	At December 31, 2011, non-performing construction loans consisted of two loans to the same borrower secured by a first mortgage on a 77,000 square foot newly constructed Class A office building, a 7,000 square foot fully leased retail building and a parcel of land with approvals for an 110,000 square foot office building located in Parsippany, New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S12	The office building is completed, except for tenant improvements, but not leased due to weakness in the market.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S13	The property is being marketed and the principals are supporting the project.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S14	The loan was current as to the payment of principal and interest at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S15	The Company has an unfunded commitment of $3.6 million on this loan at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S16	Non-performing multi-family loans at December 31, 2011, consisted of one loan for $997,000, compared to a $201,000 non-performing multi-family loan at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S17	In addition, non-performing consumer loans increased $1.7 million, to $8.5 million at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S18	The Company attributes the increase in non-performing consumer loans to continued elevated levels of unemployment, decreased property values and increased personal debt levels.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S19	At December 31, 2011, the Company held $12.8 million of foreclosed assets, compared with $2.9 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S20	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2011 are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S21	Foreclosed assets consisted of $6.6 million of commercial real estate, $5.5 million of residential properties, and $0.7 million of marine vessels at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S22	Non-performing assets totaled $135.4 million, or 1.91% of total assets at December 31, 2011, compared to $100.1 million, or 1.47% of total assets at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P81_S23	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $3.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P82_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P82_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P85_S1	The factors considered in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the following:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	duration and breadth of the current business cycle.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S1	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S2	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S3	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S4	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S5	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S6	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval process.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P87_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	Each quarter the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Credit Administration Officer.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P88_S5	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type, as well as qualitative and environmental factors such as:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	effects of changes in credit concentration.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	In the second quarter of 2011, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P89_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the marine portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2011, a change in methodology was made to the GVA allocation process whereby residential mortgage loans greater than or equal to 120 days past due were segregated from the rest of the residential mortgage loan population and assigned a GVA percentage based upon a review of actual losses recorded at foreclosure.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	This change was undertaken in recognition of the fact that residential mortgages are charged down to estimated fair value when they are four payments past due.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P90_S2	Valuations are subsequently obtained on an annual basis and ultimately at foreclosure, with additional charge-offs recorded if required.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S3	As a result of this process, management has established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S4	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is warranted based on factors such as the geographic concentration of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the losses inherent in commercial lending, as these types of loans are typically riskier than residential mortgages.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S5	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a continued decline in the economy, generally, a continued decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S6	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S7	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S8	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S9	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S10	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P92_S11	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P94_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P94_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with guidelines that have been established for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P95_S8	The investment strategy also considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P98_S1	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P99_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P100_S2	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P100_S3	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S9	At December 31, 2011, the Bank held $64.2 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P101_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	Deposit pricing is set weekly by the Bank s Treasury Department.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	When setting deposit pricing, the Bank considers competitive market rates, FHLB advance rates and rates on other sources of funds.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	Core deposits, defined as savings accounts, interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts and money market deposit accounts represented 78.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 and 73.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, time deposits maturing in less than one year amounted to $755 million and $820 million, respectively.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	Repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the Bank, with an agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed-upon price and date.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	The Bank uses wholesale repurchase agreements, as well as retail repurchase agreements as an investment vehicle for its commercial sweep checking product.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P115_S2	Bank policies limit the use of repurchase agreements to collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations or mortgage-related securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P115_S3	As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances upon the security of the FHLB common stock owned and certain residential mortgage loans, provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P126_S3	The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company s compliance with various regulatory requirements.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P127_S1	The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as the deposit insurer.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P127_S2	The Bank files reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P127_S3	The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P127_S4	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P127_S5	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P128_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations and stockholders.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P129_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) has made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P129_S1	Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will impact the Company and the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P129_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P129_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function currently assigned to principal regulators, and will have authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P129_S4	However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will have back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P130_S0	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P131_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P131_S1	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P132_S0	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P133_S0	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P133_S1	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P134_S0	exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P134_S1	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P134_S2	See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P135_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P135_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P135_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P136_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P136_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P136_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P137_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P137_S1	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P137_S2	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P138_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P139_S0	FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P139_S1	The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P139_S2	Tier 1 capital is comprised of:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P140_S0	minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P141_S0	Tier 2 capital is comprised of:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P142_S0	up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P143_S0	The allowance for loan losses may be includible in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P143_S1	Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P144_S0	The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition, with a rating of 1 (the highest examination rating of the FDIC for banks) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth, of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P144_S1	For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S0	The FDIC regulations also establish a risk-based capital standard.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S1	The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S2	In determining the amount of a bank s risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S3	The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing such bank s capital adequacy.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S4	Under such a risk assessment, examiners will evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P145_S5	According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P146_S0	the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P146_S1	Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to maintain additional capital.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P146_S2	The following table shows the Bank s leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2011:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P147_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P147_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P147_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P148_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P148_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P149_S0	meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P150_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S2	The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P151_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2011, dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $1.8 million.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P152_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank were insured generally up to a maximum of $100,000 for each separately insured depositor, and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P152_S1	In October 2008, however, the FDIC temporarily increased the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance available on all deposit accounts to $250,000.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P152_S2	That limit was made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P152_S3	Additionally, certain non-interest-bearing transaction accounts maintained with financial institutions participating in the FDIC s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLG Program ) were fully insured regardless of the dollar amount until June 30, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P152_S4	The Dodd-Frank Act extended unlimited coverage for certain non-interest bearing transaction accounts until December 31, 2012.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P153_S0	The FDIC imposes an assessment against financial institutions for deposit insurance.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P153_S1	This assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and prior to 2009, ranged from 5 to 43 basis points of the institution s deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P153_S2	On February 27, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule raising the deposit insurance assessment rates to a range from 12 to 45 basis points.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P153_S3	The rule became effective as of April 1, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P153_S4	The rule provided for certain adjustments to the rate that effectively made the range up to 77.5 basis points.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P154_S0	On May 22, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P154_S1	The amount of the special assessment for any institution did not exceed 10 basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P154_S2	The Bank paid this special assessment in the amount of $3.1 million on September 30, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P155_S0	On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a rule that required depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P155_S1	These assessments were payable on December 30, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P155_S2	The total prepaid assessment of $31.3 million was remitted to the FDIC on that date.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P155_S3	Of that amount, $27.4 million was recorded as a prepaid asset as of December 31, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P155_S4	Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded an expense for its regular assessment for each quarter, with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset until it is fully expensed.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P156_S0	On November 9, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule which revises its deposit insurance regulations to include noninterest-bearing transaction accounts as a new temporary deposit insurance category.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S0	As defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, noninterest-bearing accounts include only such demand deposit or checking accounts that provide for unlimited transfers and withdrawals at any time, and which are maintained by individuals, businesses, or other types of depositors.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S1	The funds maintained in such accounts are insured without limit, with such coverage being separate from coverage provided to depositors for all other accounts maintained at an insured institution.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S2	This rule became effective on December 31, 2010 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S3	On December 15, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule which sets the insurance funds designated reserve ratio (DRR) at 2% of estimated insured deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S4	The FDIC is required to set a DRR annually, and must consider the following factors when doing so: the risk of loss to the insurance fund, economic conditions affecting the banking industry, prevention of sharp swings in assessment rates, and such other factors deemed important.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S5	The rule became effective on January 1, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S6	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that establishes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S7	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P157_S8	The rule also changes the assessment base from a bank s adjusted domestic deposits to its average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, as addressed below.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P158_S0	As of April 1, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised its assessment system to base it on an institution s average total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P158_S1	The FDIC also revised the assessment range so that it is now 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible capital (inclusive of potential risk adjustments).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P159_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P159_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P160_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P160_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P160_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P161_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P162_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P162_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P163_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P164_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P164_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P165_S0	by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P166_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P166_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P167_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P167_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P167_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P168_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P169_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P169_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P169_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P169_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P170_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P171_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P171_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of August 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P171_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P171_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P172_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P172_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P173_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P174_S0	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P174_S1	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P174_S2	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P175_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P175_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P175_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P175_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P176_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P177_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P178_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P178_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P179_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P180_S0	An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P181_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P181_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P181_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P181_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P182_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P183_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P184_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P184_S1	This law is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P185_S1	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P186_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to the average consolidated assets less average tangible capital of a depository institution.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P186_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor, and provided unlimited deposit insurance through January 1, 2013 for non-interest bearing demand transaction activities at all insured depository institutions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P187_S0	A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective on July 1, 2011, repealed the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P187_S1	Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could increase interest expense at depository institutions like the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P187_S2	The legislation also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P188_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P188_S1	The Securities and Exchange Commission has been authorized to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P188_S2	The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P189_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P190_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P190_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P190_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P191_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P192_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P192_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S1	The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $11.5 million and up to $71.0 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $71.0 million.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S2	The first $11.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P193_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P194_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P195_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P195_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P195_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted to various aspects of internet banking, and have indicated their intention to reevaluate their regulations to ensure that they encourage banks efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P195_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P196_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P196_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P196_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis structured similarily to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S6	As of December 31, 2011, the Company s total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P197_S7	The following table shows the Company s Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2011:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P198_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P198_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P198_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P199_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P199_S1	That will eliminate from Tier 1 capital the inclusion of certain instruments such as trust preferred securities, that are currently includable by bank holding companies.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P199_S2	Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for bank holding companies of under $15 billion in consolidated assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P199_S3	The Company has no trust preferred securities in its Tier 1 capital.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P200_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P200_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P201_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P201_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P202_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P203_S0	any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not qualify as a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P204_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P205_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P206_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify as a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P206_S1	The Company has not elected to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations, although it may seek to do so in the future.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P206_S2	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if:
1178970_12_ITEM1_P207_S0	the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to become a financial holding company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P208_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P208_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P209_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P209_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P211_S4	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P211_S5	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P211_S6	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P212_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P212_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P213_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P214_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P214_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P214_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P215_S0	Retained earnings at December 31, 2011 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P215_S1	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P215_S2	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P215_S3	At December 31, 2011, the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $21.2 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P216_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_12_ITEM1_P216_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P216_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P217_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P217_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P218_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.

1178970_12_ITEM1_P220_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P220_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P220_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P220_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_12_ITEM1_P220_S4	As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and a franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	course of conducting our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the financial services industry.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following discusses the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations, as well as other significant risk factors which are particularly relevant during the current period of economic and market disruption.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your investment in the Company s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company s common stock.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Continued and Sustained Deterioration in the Housing Sector and Related Markets and Prolonged Elevated Unemployment Levels May Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Results During 2011, general economic conditions did not materially improve.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P0_S4	While we did not invest in sub-prime mortgages and related investments, our lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied, in large part, to the housing market.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Declines in home prices, increases in foreclosures, the protracted foreclosure process in New Jersey and unemployment have adversely impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans, resulting in the reductions in collateral and net asset values.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	The continuing housing slump has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing, declines in home prices, and has contributed to elevated delinquencies on residential and commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	These conditions may potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P1_S3	A worsening of these negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our strategy continues to be to increase our commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	At December 31, 2011, the average loan size for a construction loan was $3.8 million, for a commercial mortgage loan was $2.0 million, and for a commercial loan was $479,000, compared to an average loan size of $204,000 for a single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P3_S2	The local economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, including an unemployment rate of 9.1% at December 31, 2011, have a significant impact on our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and residential mortgage loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P3_S3	A continuing significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, further declines in real estate values and the continued slump in real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These small- to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Our Allowance for Loan Losses May Not be Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Could Decrease Our borrowers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P4_S4	We may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our emphasis on the continued diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our results of operations are substantially dependent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Changes in interest rates, a prolonged low interest rate environment, or a flattening yield curve could have an adverse affect on net interest income to the extent our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or at different relative interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S3	A prolonged low interest rate environment could result in asset yields contracting at a rate in excess of reductions in funding costs as a result of implied funding rate floors.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S4	A flattening yield curve could result in a reduction in the spread between earning asset yields and funding costs, adversely impacting net interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S5	An increase in interest rates generally could result in a decrease in our average interest rate spread and net interest income, which would have a negative effect on our profitability.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S6	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 4.2% or $9.1 million.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S9	At December 31, 2011, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.38 billion.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S10	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S11	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P7_S12	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain reduced borrowing costs.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments are not available to reinvest at prevailing market rates at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We Hold Certain Intangible Assets That Could Be Classified As Impaired in the Future.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	If These Assets Are Considered to Be Either Partially or Fully Impaired in The Future, Our Earnings Could Decline We record all assets and liabilities acquired by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaling $353.3 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	The Company early adopted amended guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P11_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Continued or Further Declines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment Charge, Which Would Reduce Our Earnings Our securities portfolio includes securities that have declined in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the financial sector in general and the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S6	These securities include private label mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S7	A prolonged decline in the value of these securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P14_S8	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance premiums and may also increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P15_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P15_S3	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	As a bank holding company, Provident Financial Services, Inc. is subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.

1178970_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on The Provident Bank , Provident Financial Services, Inc., and our operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act, Among Other Things, Created a New Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Tightened Capital Standards and Resulted in New Laws and Regulations That Are Expected to Increase Our Costs of Operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) is significantly changing the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P18_S3	However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations may materially increase our operating and compliance costs.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Banks such as ours with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Effective July 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance assessments.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Assessments are now based on the average consolidated assets less tangible capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions to $250,000 per depositor and non-interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through December 31, 2012.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Strong Competition Within Our Market Area May Limit Our Growth and Profitability Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In particular, over the past decade, New Jersey has experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S3	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S4	Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P24_S5	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We rely on communications and information systems to conduct our business.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Any failure, interruption or compromise in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our business operations.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P25_S2	While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security compromise of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security compromise will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.
1178970_12_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security compromise of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.

1178970_12_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the first quarter of 2011, the Company s executive offices were relocated to a leased facility which also houses the Bank s Main Office at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM2_P0_S3	This was necessitated by the relocation of the Bank s administrative offices from 830 Bergen Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey to a leased facility at 100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey, which was completed during the second quarter 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM2_P0_S4	The Bank s 830 Bergen Avenue administrative office building and its former loan administration center building at 1000 Woodbridge Center Drive, Woodbridge, New Jersey were sold in the fourth quarter of 2011.

1178970_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 82 full-service branches throughout northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2011, commercial loans accounted for 59.8% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 40.2%.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending relationships.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	Core deposits, consisting of all savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	At December 31, 2011, core deposits were 78.1% of total deposits.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	On August 11, 2011, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, The Provident Bank, completed its acquisition of Beacon Trust Company, a New Jersey limited purpose trust company, and Beacon Global Asset Management, Inc., an SEC-registered investment advisor incorporated in Delaware (collectively Beacon ).
1178970_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement announced on May 19, 2011, Beacon s former parent company, Beacon Financial Corporation, may be paid cash consideration in an amount up to $10.5 million, based upon the acquired companies financial performance in the three years following the closing of the transaction.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P10_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P12_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P13_S7	A sample of risk ratings are also reviewed and confirmed through the Loan Review function and periodically, by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval process.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type and other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries, loan volume, as well as, the national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	In the second quarter of 2011, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P14_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the marine portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	change in methodology was made to the GVA allocation process whereby residential mortgage loans greater than or equal to 120 days past due were segregated from the rest of the residential mortgage loan population and assigned a GVA percentage based upon a review of actual losses recorded at foreclosure.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	This change was undertaken in recognition of the fact that residential mortgages are charged down to estimated fair value when they are four payments past due.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	Valuations are subsequently obtained on an annual basis and ultimately at foreclosure, with additional charge-offs recorded if require.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a continued decline in the economy, generally, a continued decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P16_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P18_S1	Effective September 30, 2011, the Company early adopted amended guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P18_S2	The new guidance provides the option to qualitatively determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P18_S3	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P18_S4	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	The guidance provides certain factors a company should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) is warranted.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P29_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P30_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P30_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P32_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P33_S1	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P33_S2	In this evaluation, the Company recognized other-than-temporary securities impairment losses in earnings totaling $302,000, $170,000 and $2.0 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carryback years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	A valuation reserve of $1.1 million was established in 2009 pertaining primarily to state tax benefits on net operating losses at the Bank and unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	In 2011, management released the valuation allowance associated with the state net operating losses, approximately $840,000, due to expectation of current and future taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P36_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P36_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 Total assets increased $272.9 million, or 4.0%, to $7.10 billion at December 31, 2011, from $6.82 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily due to an increase in net loans outstanding.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S1	Cash and cash equivalents increased $17.4 million to $69.6 million at December 31, 2011, from $52.2 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company expects to deploy these cash balances to fund loan originations and investment purchases and repay maturing borrowings.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S3	Total loans increased $238.1 million, or 5.5%, to $4.58 billion at December 31, 2011, from $4.41 billion at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2011, loan originations totaling $1.51 billion and loan purchases of $79.5 million were partially offset by repayments of $1.30 billion and loan sales of $12.9 million.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S5	Multi-family loans increased $177.0 million to $564.1 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $387.2 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S6	Commercial loans increased $93.5 million to $849.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $755.5 million at December 31, 2010, and commercial real estate loans increased $73.4 million to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S7	Residential mortgage loans decreased $77.7 million to $1.31 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2010, as loan repayments attributable to an active refinance market outpaced originations.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P41_S8	One- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations totaled $146.7 million and one- to four-family residential mortgage loans purchased totaled $79.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	the year ended December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	Construction loans decreased $10.4 million to $114.8 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $125.2 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	The Company has de-emphasized construction lending for the past two years due to adverse market conditions.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	Consumer loans decreased $8.6 million to $561.0 million at December 31, 2011, compared to $569.6 million at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	Commercial loans, consisting of commercial real estate, multi-family, construction and commercial loans, totaled $2.78 billion, accounting for 59.8% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, compared to $2.45 billion, or 55.6% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P42_S5	The Company intends to continue to focus on the origination of commercially-oriented loans.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	Retail loans, which consist of one- to four-family residential mortgage and consumer loans, such as fixed-rate home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $1.87 billion and accounted for 40.2% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, compared to $1.96 billion, or 44.4%, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P43_S1	The increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was a result of growth in the multi-family and commercial mortgage portfolios, coupled with reductions in retail loans attributable to refinance activity, the market preference for longer-term fixed-rate loans, which the Company chooses to sell rather than retain for portfolio as part of its interest rate risk management process, and lack of qualified retail loan demand.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	Prior to September 30, 2008, the Company originated Alt-A mortgages in the form of stated income loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% on a limited basis.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P45_S1	The balance of these Alt-A loans at December 31, 2011 was $11.3 million.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P45_S2	Of this total, 8 loans totaling $3.0 million were 90 days or more delinquent.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P45_S3	General valuation reserves of 6.5%, or $195,000, were allocated to these loans at December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	The Company participates in loans originated by other banks, including participations designated as Shared National Credits ( SNC ).
1178970_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	The Company s gross commitments and outstanding balances as a participant in SNCs were $82.1 million and $58.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011.

1178970_12_ITEM7_P53_S4	These improvements were partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $9.6 million resulting from increased taxable income and an increase in the provision for loan losses of $5.3 million attributable to increases in non-performing loans, downgrades in credit risk ratings, and an increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM7_P53_S5	Additionally, earnings for the year ended December 31, 2009 were impacted by an industry-wide special assessment imposed by the FDIC as part of its plan to restore the deposit insurance fund.

1178970_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitively priced within the marketplace, typically within the upper quartile of rates offered by competitors.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P5_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2011, in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 4.2%, or $9.1 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P8_S2	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 3.9%, or $8.4 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2011, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 14.1%, or $173.9 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P9_S3	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 0.9%, or $11.0 million decrease in the present value of equity.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P10_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P2_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P3_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of evaluating other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities due to the adoption of new accounting requirements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, as of April 1, 2009.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P4_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Provident Financial Services, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.: We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s and subsidiary (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) .
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P5_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S4	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P6_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2011, and our report dated February 29, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), The Provident Bank (the Bank ) and their wholly owned subsidiaries.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P9_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P10_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P12_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P14_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	As a result of the Company s adoption of new guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 320 Investments-Debt and Equity Securities on April 1, 2009, to determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P15_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P17_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P18_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P18_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment of yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S2	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives, of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S3	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S4	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S5	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P22_S6	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P23_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P25_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P25_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P25_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P26_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P29_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P29_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P30_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P33_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P33_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P33_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30, and the impairment test at September 30, 2011 indicated that there was no impairment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P34_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P35_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P39_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P39_S4	Expense related to stock options is based on the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the options.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P39_S5	Expense related to stock awards is based on the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P45_S1	Other comprehensive income includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P45_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in the Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing to its customers traditional banking and other financial services.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	These potentially dilutive shares would then be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Shares issued and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements Effective September 30, 2011, the Company early adopted amended guidance on goodwill impairment assessment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance that would simplify the assessment process, under which an entity has the option to first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying Step 1 of the goodwill impairment assessment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S4	The qualitative assessment is optional and an entity is permitted to go directly to Step 1 without performing the qualitative assessment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S5	This guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P51_S6	The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated statement of condition or results of operations.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	Under this guidance, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P52_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P52_S3	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	As originally issued, ASU 2011-5 requires entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented (for both interim and annual financial statements).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P53_S1	This requirement was deferred by ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted, and must be applied retrospectively.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated statement of condition or results of operations In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance regarding a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a TDR.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	The guidance clarifies which loan modifications constitute TDRs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	It is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a TDR, both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of TDRs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	This guidance applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The adoption of this guidance on July 1, 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated statement of condition or results of operations.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	In April 2011, the FASB issued guidance to improve financial reporting of repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	The amendments to this guidance remove from the assessment of effective control: (1) the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially the agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee, and (2) the collateral maintenance implementation guidance related to that criterion.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	Other criteria applicable to the assessment of effective control are not changed by this new guidance.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	Those criteria indicate that the transferor is deemed to have maintained effective control over the financial assets transferred (and thus must account for the transaction as a secured borrowing) for agreements that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem the financial assets before their maturity if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the financial assets to be repurchased or redeemed are the same or substantially the same as those transferred; (2) the agreement is to repurchase or redeem them before maturity, at a fixed or determinable price; and (3) the agreement is entered into contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	This guidance is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011, and should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	This guidance requires that the pro forma information be presented as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual reporting period for purposes of calculating both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	It also requires that this disclosure be accompanied by a narrative description of the amount and nature of material non-recurring pro forma adjustments.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	This guidance pertains to business combinations with effective dates on or after December 15, 2010.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company estimates the loss projections for each security by stressing the individual loans collateralizing the security and applying a range of expected default rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds in conjunction with the underlying credit enhancement for each security.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2011.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P81_S3	The following table summarizes the aging of loans receivable by portfolio segment and class as follows (in thousands):
1178970_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $122,549,000 and $97,264,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P82_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2011, or 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P82_S3	If the nonaccrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $3,496,000, $4,114,000 and $2,430,000, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P83_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P84_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analyses of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	A third party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses during the process described.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P89_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $497,219,000 and $474,208,000, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $273,170,000 and $258,012,000, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively), exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P102_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P102_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P103_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P103_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P133_S5	Under the Supplemental 401(k) provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $6,000 and $5,000 and included the matching contributions plus interest credited at an annual rate equal to the ten-year bond-equivalent yield on US Treasury securities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P133_S6	Under the Supplemental ESOP provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $24,000 and 17,000, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P133_S7	The phantom equity is treated as equity awards (expensed at the time of allocation) and not liability awards which would require periodic adjustment to market, as participants do not have an option to take their distribution in cash.

AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Management has determined that it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset based upon the nature and timing of the items listed above.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P147_S1	In order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P147_S2	Management has projected that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net deferred tax asset; however, there can be no assurance that such levels of taxable income will be generated.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company s policy is to report interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P148_S1	The Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans secured by real estate located in New Jersey.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in local real estate market conditions.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	(15) Regulatory Capital Requirements FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bank is required to maintain (i) a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets of 4.00%, and (ii) minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	Under its prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P154_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00%; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P157_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P158_S1	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P158_S2	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P159_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P160_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).

1178970_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P167_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P168_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the preceding table on a non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P170_S2	These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are considered Level 3 inputs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure included in the preceding table are carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P172_S1	These appraisals include adjustments to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are considered Level 3 inputs.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P174_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurement during the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P176_S1	(17) Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value estimates, methods and assumptions are set forth below for the Company s financial instruments.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	The fair value of investment securities and securities available for sale is estimated using a market approach.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P178_S2	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.

1178970_12_ITEM8_P178_S7	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	FHLB-NY stock The carrying value of FHLB-NY stock is its cost.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P180_S1	The fair value of FHLB-NY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P181_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as residential mortgage, construction and consumer.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P181_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P181_S3	The fair value of performing loans is estimated using a combination of techniques, including discounting estimated future cash flows and quoted market prices of similar instruments, where available.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P181_S4	The fair value for significant non-performing loans is based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, is equal to the amount payable on demand.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P182_S2	The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P182_S3	The fair value of borrowed funds is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P184_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P184_S2	The estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are presented in the following table (in thousands): Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P184_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	Because no active market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P185_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P186_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_12_ITEM8_P186_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

1178970_12_ITEM9A_P0_S0	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on the assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1178970_12_ITEM9A_P3_S3	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P4_S1	As a community- and customer oriented institution, the Bank emphasizes personal service and customer convenience in serving the financial needs of the individuals, families and businesses residing in its primary markets areas.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P4_S2	The Bank attracts deposits from the general public and businesses primarily in the areas surrounding its banking offices and uses those funds, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, to originate commercial real estate loans, residential mortgage loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P4_S3	The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed securities and other permissible investments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	The following are highlights of The Provident Bank s operations: Diversified Loan Portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	To improve asset yields and reduce its exposure to interest rate risk, the Bank diversifies its loan portfolio by originating commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	These loans generally have adjustable rates or shorter fixed terms and interest rates that are higher than the rates applicable to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S3	However, these loans generally have a higher risk of loss than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2012, non-performing assets were $111.5 million or 1.53% of total assets, compared to $135.4 million or 1.91% of total assets at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P5_S5	While the Bank s non-performing asset levels have been adversely impacted by the troubled real estate market and the challenging economic environment, the Bank continues to focus on conservative underwriting criteria and on active and timely collection efforts.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Emphasis on Relationship Banking and Core Deposits.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	The Bank emphasizes the acquisition and retention of core deposit accounts, such as checking and savings accounts, and expanding customer relationships.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	Core deposit accounts totaled $4.47 billion at December 31, 2012, representing 82.4% of total deposits, compared with $4.03 billion, or 78.1% of total deposits at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S3	The Bank also focuses on increasing the number of households and businesses served and the number of banking products per customer.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S4	The Bank s focus on transaction accounts and expanded products and services has enabled the Bank to generate non-interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S5	Fees derived from core deposit accounts are a primary source of non-interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S6	The Bank also offers investment products and wealth and asset management services through its subsidiaries to generate non-interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P6_S7	Total non-interest income was $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared with $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and fee income was $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared with $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Bank manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the origination and retention of adjustable rate and shorter-term loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	In addition, the Bank uses its investments in securities to manage interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	At December 31, 2012, 46.0% of the Bank s loan portfolio had a term to maturity of one year or less, or had adjustable interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	Moreover, at December 31, 2012, the Bank s securities portfolio totaled $1.66 billion and had an expected average life of 3.75 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	MARKET AREA The Company and the Bank are headquartered in Jersey City, which is located in Hudson County, New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	Mercer, 22 in Middlesex, 9 in Monmouth, 10 in Morris, 4 in Ocean, 1 in Passaic, 4 in Somerset and 3 in Union Counties.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Bank also maintains its administrative offices in Iselin, New Jersey and satellite loan production offices in Convent Station and Princeton, New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P9_S2	The Bank s lending activities, though concentrated in the communities surrounding its offices, extend predominantly throughout the State of New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P9_S3	The Bank s eleven-county primary market area includes a mix of urban and suburban communities and has a diversified mix of industries including pharmaceutical and other manufacturing companies, network communications, insurance and financial services, healthcare, and retail.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	According to the U.S. Census Bureau s most recent population data for 2012, the Bank s eleven-county market area has a population of 6.6 million, which was 74.6% of the state s total population.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	Because of the diversity of industries in the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in New Jersey remained elevated at 9.6% at December 31, 2012, and increased from 9.1% at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Within its primary market area, the Bank had an approximate 2.31% share of bank deposits as of June 30, 2012, the latest date for which statistics are available, and an approximate 1.95% deposit share of the New Jersey market statewide.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The Bank faces intense competition both in originating loans, retaining loans and attracting deposits.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	The northern and central New Jersey market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits has come from the several commercial banks and savings banks in its market area, especially large regional banks which have obtained a major share of the available deposit market due in part to acquisitions and consolidations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S3	Many of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank and offer services that the Bank does not provide.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund industry and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S5	The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiary.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P13_S6	Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank s branch network, its deployment of branch and off-site ATMs, and its telephone and web-based banking services.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate and other consumer loans, for borrowers generally located within its primary market area.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to standards that allow the sale of the loans to the secondary markets, primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA or Fannie Mae ) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC or Freddie Mac ).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	To manage interest rate risk, the Bank generally sells fixed-rate residential mortgages that it originates with terms greater than 15 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Bank commonly retains biweekly payment fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with a term of 25 years or less and a majority of the originated adjustable rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Generally, these loans have terms of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Bank historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	Since 2008, the Bank significantly reduced for sale construction loan originations due to adverse market conditions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	In most cases, for the single family/condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P18_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Bank originates consumer loans that are secured, in most cases, by a borrower s assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by a first or second mortgage lien on the borrower s residence comprise the largest category of the Bank s consumer loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	The Bank s consumer loan portfolio also includes marine loans made on an indirect basis that are secured by a first lien on recreational boats.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	The marine loans were generated via boat dealers located on the East Coast of the United States.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S4	The Bank discontinued indirect marine lending in 2010.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P19_S5	Marine loans are currently made on a direct, limited accommodation basis to existing customers.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	Commercial loans are made to businesses of varying size and type within the Bank s market.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	The Bank lends to established businesses, and the loans are generally secured by business assets such as equipment, receivables, inventory, real estate or marketable securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	On a limited basis, the Bank makes unsecured commercial loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Most commercial lines of credit are made on a floating interest rate basis and most term loans are made on a fixed interest rate basis, usually with terms of five years or less.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P20_S4	Set forth below is selected information concerning the composition of the loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages (after deductions for deferred fees and costs, unearned discounts and premiums and allowances for losses) as of the dates indicated.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2012, regarding the maturities of loans in the loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Demand loans having no stated schedule of repayment and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due within one year.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	The following table sets forth at December 31, 2012, the dollar amount of all fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans due after December 31, 2013.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Bank originates residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences, generally located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	The Bank originates residential mortgages primarily through commissioned mortgage representatives, the Internet and its branch offices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P23_S2	The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P23_S3	As of December 31, 2012, $1.27 billion or 26.2% of the total portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P23_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 66.5% were fixed-rate and 33.5% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	The Bank has offered adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2 3 / 4 %, adjusting annually with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P25_S1	The Company does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	Prior to September 30, 2008, the Company originated on a limited basis Alt-A mortgages in the form of stated income loans with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50%.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	The balance of these Alt-A loans at December 31, 2012 was $9.5 million.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	Residential loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S4	Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 25 years or less.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S5	The Bank retains the majority of the originated adjustable-rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S8	In 2012, $36.7 million, or 19.9% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S9	All of the loans sold in 2012 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P27_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $53.0 million.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $8.5 million for the past five years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	Commercial real estate loans were 27.9% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	A substantial majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P30_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P30_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P31_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	The Bank performs more extensive diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P74_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P74_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for modified loans previously discussed.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2012, there were 108 impaired loans totaling $109.6 million.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P76_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P77_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P77_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P77_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P79_S3	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2012, actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described above.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans decreased $449,000 to $29.1 million at December 31, 2012, from $29.5 million at December 31, 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P87_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P87_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P87_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P90_S1	The factors considered in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the following:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	duration and breadth of the current business cycle.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S3	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S4	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S5	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S6	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P92_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P93_S5	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type, as well as qualitative and environmental factors such as:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	effects of changes in credit concentration.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P94_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P94_S2	In the first quarter of 2012, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P94_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the marine portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P96_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P96_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P96_S3	As a result of this process, management has established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S0	loan losses is warranted based on factors such as the geographic concentration of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and the losses inherent in commercial lending, as these types of loans are typically riskier than residential mortgages.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S1	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a continued decline in the economy, generally, a continued decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S2	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S3	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S4	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S5	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S6	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P97_S7	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P98_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P98_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P99_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P99_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P99_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P99_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P99_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S2	The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with guidelines that have been established for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P100_S8	The investment strategy also considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P101_S0	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P101_S1	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P102_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P102_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P102_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P103_S0	obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P103_S1	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P104_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P104_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P104_S2	If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P104_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P105_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P105_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P105_S2	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P105_S3	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S9	At December 31, 2012, the Bank held $42.0 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P106_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_13_ITEM1_P132_S1	The Company is also subject to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the New Jersey Banking Act ) and the regulations of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance ( Commissioner ) under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P133_S0	The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P133_S1	The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S0	The Bank is a New Jersey chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S1	The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as its deposit insurer.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S2	The Bank files reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S3	The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S4	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P134_S5	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P135_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S1	Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are impacting the Company and the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations, a function currently assigned to principal regulators, and will have authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S4	However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will have back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P136_S5	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P137_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P137_S1	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P138_S0	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P139_S0	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P139_S1	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P139_S2	New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P139_S3	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P139_S4	See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P140_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P140_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P140_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P141_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P141_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P141_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P142_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P142_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P142_S2	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P142_S3	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P143_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P144_S0	FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P144_S1	The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P144_S2	Tier 1 capital is comprised of:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P145_S0	minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P146_S0	Tier 2 capital is comprised of:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P147_S0	up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P147_S1	The allowance for loan losses may be includible in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P147_S2	Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P148_S0	The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition, with a rating of 1 (the highest examination rating of the FDIC for banks) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth, of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P148_S1	For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S0	The FDIC regulations also establish a risk-based capital standard.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S1	The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S2	In determining the amount of a bank s risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S3	The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing such bank s capital adequacy.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S4	Under such a risk assessment, examiners will evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P149_S5	According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P150_S0	the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P150_S1	Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to maintain additional capital.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P150_S2	The following table shows the Bank s leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2012:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P151_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P151_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S0	On June 6, 2012, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules that would revise their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S1	The proposed rules would apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more and top-tier savings and loan holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S2	Among other things, the proposed rules would establish a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets) and a higher minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (6% of risk-weighted assets) and assign higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S3	The proposed rules would also require unrealized gains and losses on certain securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S4	The proposed rules would limit a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of a specified amount of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S5	The proposed rules indicated that the final rules would become effective on January 1, 2013, and the changes set forth in the final rules will be phased in from January 1, 2013 through January 1, 2019.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P153_S6	However, the agencies subsequently indicated that, due to the volume of public comments received, the final rule has been delayed past January 1, 2013.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P154_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P154_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P154_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P155_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S2	The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P156_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2012, dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $37.5 million.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P157_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P158_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act provided certain non-interest-bearing transaction accounts with full insurance regardless of the dollar amount until December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P159_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P159_S1	An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P159_S2	Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P160_S0	The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P161_S0	No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P162_S0	On May 22, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P162_S1	The amount of the special assessment for any institution did not exceed 10 basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of 2009.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P162_S2	The Bank paid this special assessment in the amount of $3.1 million on September 30, 2009.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P163_S0	On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a rule that required depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P163_S1	These assessments were payable on December 30, 2009.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P163_S2	The total prepaid assessment of $31.3 million was remitted to the FDIC on that date.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P163_S3	Of that amount, $27.4 million was recorded as a prepaid asset as of December 31, 2009.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P163_S4	Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded an expense for its regular assessment for each quarter, with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset until it was fully expensed.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P164_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P164_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P164_S2	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that establishes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P164_S3	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P165_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P165_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P166_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P166_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P166_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P167_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P168_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P168_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P169_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P170_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P170_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P170_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P171_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P171_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P172_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P172_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P172_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P173_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P174_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P174_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P174_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations replace the prior process-based assessment factors with a new evaluation system that rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P174_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P175_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P176_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P176_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of August 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P176_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P176_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P177_S0	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P178_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P178_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P178_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P178_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P179_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P179_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P179_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P179_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P180_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P181_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P182_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P182_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P183_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P184_S0	An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P185_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P185_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P185_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P185_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P186_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P186_S1	The recently proposed rules that would increase regulatory capital standards would adjust the prompt corrective action categories accordingly.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P187_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P188_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P188_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P188_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P189_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P190_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P190_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P191_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P192_S0	be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $12.4 million and up to $79.5 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $79.5 million.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P192_S1	The first $12.4 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P192_S2	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P192_S3	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P192_S4	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P193_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P194_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P194_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P194_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted to various aspects of internet banking, and have indicated their intention to reevaluate their regulations to ensure that they encourage banks efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P194_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P195_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P196_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P196_S1	This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P197_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P197_S1	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P198_S0	A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective on July 1, 2011, repealed the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P198_S1	Depending on competitive responses, this significant change to existing law could increase interest expense at depository institutions like the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P198_S2	The legislation also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P199_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P199_S1	The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P200_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P200_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P200_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P201_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S0	other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S1	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S2	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S3	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S4	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis structured similarly, but not identically, to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S5	As of December 31, 2012, the Company s total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P202_S6	The following table shows the Company s Tier 1 leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2012:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P203_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P203_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P203_S2	As of December 31, 2012, the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P204_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P204_S1	That will eliminate from Tier 1 capital the inclusion of certain instruments such as trust preferred securities that are currently includable by bank holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P204_S2	Instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for bank holding companies of under $15 billion in consolidated assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P204_S3	The Company has no trust preferred securities in its Tier 1 capital.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P205_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P205_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P206_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P206_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P207_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P207_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P208_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P209_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P210_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P210_S1	The Company has not elected to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations, although it may seek to do so in the future.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P210_S2	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if:
1178970_13_ITEM1_P211_S0	the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to become a financial holding company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P212_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P212_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P213_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P213_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P213_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P214_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S2	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S3	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S4	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S5	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P215_S6	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P216_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P216_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P217_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P218_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P218_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P218_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P219_S0	Retained earnings at December 31, 2012 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P219_S1	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P219_S2	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P219_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $21.2 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P220_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_13_ITEM1_P220_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P220_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P221_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P221_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P222_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P222_S1	At December 31, 2012, the Company had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P223_S0	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P224_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P224_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P225_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P225_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of taxable income.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P225_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_13_ITEM1_P225_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the financial services industry.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following discusses the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations, as well as other significant risk factors which are particularly relevant during the current period of continued economic and market disruption.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P0_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your investment in the Company s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company s common stock.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Deterioration in the housing sector and related markets and prolonged elevated unemployment levels may adversely affect our business and financial results.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	During 2012, general economic conditions did not materially improve.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	While we did not invest in sub-prime mortgages and related investments, our lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied, in large part, to the housing market.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Lower home prices, the continued high level of foreclosures, the protracted foreclosure process in New Jersey and high unemployment have adversely impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans, resulting in reductions in collateral values.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The housing slump has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of single-family housing, declines in home prices, and has contributed to elevated delinquencies on residential and commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These conditions may potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A worsening of these negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our strategy continues to be to increase our commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S6	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P2_S8	At December 31, 2012, the average loan size for a construction loan was $3.6 million, for a commercial mortgage loan was $2.0 million, and for a commercial loan was $428,000, compared to an average loan size of $206,000 for a single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S3	Our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S5	The local economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, including an unemployment rate of 9.6% at December 31, 2012, have a significant impact on our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and residential mortgage loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S6	A further decline in local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P3_S7	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, further declines in real estate values and the continued slump in real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	These small- to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies do not continue to improve or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Our emphasis on the continued diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S6	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S7	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P5_S8	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	If rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 5.6% or $12.0 million.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S5	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S6	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S7	At December 31, 2012, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.26 billion.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S8	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S9	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P7_S10	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments are not available to reinvest at prevailing market rates at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain lower borrowing costs.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	The Federal Reserve Board has recently maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which has resulted in increases in net interest income in the short term.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P11_S2	The Federal Reserve Board has indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates through late 2014 or until the national unemployment rate decreases to 6.5%.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may decrease, which may have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We record all assets and liabilities acquired by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	At December 31, 2012, goodwill totaling $352.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P13_S4	The Company early adopted amended guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a two step quantitative impairment analysis.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P15_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P15_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Further declines in the value of certain investment securities could require an other-than-temporary impairment charge which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Our securities portfolio includes securities that have declined in value due to the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related and weaker credit performance of collateral underlying such securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S7	These securities include private label mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P18_S8	A prolonged decline in the value of these securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	As a bank holding company, Provident Financial Services, Inc. is subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P20_S2	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P20_S4	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created a new consumer financial protection bureau, tightened capital standards and resulted in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may still not be known for some time.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations may materially increase our operating and compliance costs.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Banks such as ours with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	Risks associated with cyber-security, system failures, interruptions, or other breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Information technology systems are critical to our business.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, financial reporting, securities investments, deposits, and loans.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Our risk management program may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Our risk management program is designed to minimize risk and loss to us.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S5	We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S6	While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Recent economic conditions and heightened regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S8	Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S9	Acts of terrorism, severe weather and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P32_S10	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Additionally, recent severe weather-related events have adversely impacted customers in our market area, especially those in areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S4	While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P33_S5	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In particular, over the past decade, New Jersey has experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2012, commercial loans accounted for 62.4% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 37.6%.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending relationships.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P10_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P10_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P10_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P12_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P13_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party and periodically, by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type and other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries, loan volume, as well as, the national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P15_S1	In the first quarter of 2012, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to the indirect marine loan portfolio were increased to reflect an increase in historical loss experience.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a continued decline in the economy, generally, a continued decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P16_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company qualitatively determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P18_S2	If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P18_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	The guidance provides certain factors an entity should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P26_S2	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) was warranted.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P29_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P30_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P30_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P31_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	In this evaluation, the Company did not recognize other-than-temporary securities impairment losses in 2012, but did recognize losses totaling $302,000 and $170,000 in 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carryback years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	A valuation reserve of $1.1 million was established in 2009 pertaining primarily to state tax benefits on net operating losses at the Bank and unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	In 2011, management released the valuation allowance associated with the state net operating losses, approximately $840,000, due to expectation of current and future taxable income.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $242,000, related to unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	The increase in commercial loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio was a result of growth in the multi-family and commercial mortgage portfolios, coupled with reductions in retail loans attributable to refinance activity, the market preference for longer-term fixed-rate loans, which the Company chooses to sell rather than retain for portfolio as part of its interest rate risk management process, and lack of qualified retail loan demand.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P51_S3	The increase in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012, was largely attributable to continued improvements in asset quality and related reductions in the provision for loan losses, inclusive of consideration for possible loan losses related to Superstorm Sandy, while growth in both average loans outstanding and average lower-costing core deposits more than offset the impact of compression in asset yields.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P51_S4	Net interest income increased $1.3 million to $217.3 million for 2012, from $216.0 million for 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P51_S9	The decrease in interest income was attributable to a decrease in the yield on average earning assets, partially offset by an increase in average earning asset balances.

1178970_13_ITEM7_P51_S15	The decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower short-term interest rates coupled with a shift in the funding composition to lower-costing core deposits from certificates of deposit and a reduction in average borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances.
1178970_13_ITEM7_P51_S16	The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 30 basis points to 0.83% for 2012, from 1.13% for 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal funds rate or LIBOR.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Investment securities purchases generally have maturities of five years or less, and mortgage-backed securities have weighted average lives initially between three and five years.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Asset/Liability Committee meets on at least a monthly basis to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income and economic value of equity.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Members of the Asset/Liability Committee include the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other senior officers from the Bank s finance, lending, credit and customer management departments.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core-funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 17.6% at December 31, 2012, compared to 21.9% at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts are generally short-term.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2012, 65.2% of all time deposits had maturities of one year or less compared to 66.9% at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitively priced within the marketplace.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB of New York during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2012, in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 5.6%, or $12.0 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 1.2%, or $2.6 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2012, in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 17.6%, or $218.6 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P9_S3	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 1.5%, or $19.1 million decrease in the present value of equity.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_13_ITEM7A_P10_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s and subsidiary (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) .
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S6	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P5_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S4	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P6_S5	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012, and our report dated March 1, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P9_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P10_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), The Provident Bank (the Bank ) and their wholly owned subsidiaries.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P10_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P11_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P13_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P15_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P16_S2	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 320 Investments-Debt and Equity Securities on April 1, 2009, to determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P16_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P16_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P18_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P18_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P19_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P21_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives, of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P23_S1	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P23_S2	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P23_S3	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P24_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P26_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P26_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P26_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P29_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P30_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	For AOCI reclassification items that are not reclassified in their entirety into net income, a cross reference to other required U.S. GAAP disclosures.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2012, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Effective March 31, 2012, the Company adopted guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	In June 2011, the FASB issued guidance providing an entity with the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	In both options, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P52_S3	This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P57_S2	Other criteria applicable to the assessment of effective control are not changed by this new guidance.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P57_S3	Those criteria indicate that the transferor is deemed to have maintained effective control over the financial assets transferred (and thus must account for the transaction as a secured borrowing) for agreements that both entitle and obligate the transferor to repurchase or redeem the financial assets before their maturity if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the financial assets to be repurchased or redeemed are the same or substantially the same as those transferred; (2) the agreement is to repurchase or redeem them before maturity, at a fixed or determinable price; and (3) the agreement is entered into contemporaneously with, or in contemplation of, the transfer.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P57_S4	This guidance became effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2011, and should be applied prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions that occur on or after the effective date.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $98,990,000 and $122,549,000 at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P79_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2012, or 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P79_S3	If the nonaccrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $3,022,000, $3,496,000 and $4,114,000, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P79_S4	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was not material for the periods presented.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P80_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P80_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P81_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analyses of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	A third party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses as a result of this process.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	At December 31, 2012, there were 108 impaired loans totaling $109.6 million.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	Included in this total were 80 TDRs related to 70 borrowers totaling $58.4 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P85_S2	At December 31, 2011, there were 65 impaired loans totaling $103.2 million, of which 48 loans totaling $63.1 million were TDRs.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P85_S3	Included in this total were 38 TDRs related to 36 borrowers totaling $38.9 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P85_S4	Loans receivable summarized by portfolio segment and impairment method are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	In the third quarter of 2011, the Company adopted new accounting guidance issued by the FASB, and reassessed all restructurings that occurred between January 1, 2011 and September 30, 2011 for identification as TDRs.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	As a result of this reassessment, the Company identified an additional five loan relationships totaling $10.8 million as TDRs, $9.2 million of which had been previously identified as non-accrual impaired loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following tables present the number of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 and their balances immediately prior to the modification date and post-modification as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as previously discussed.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	Estimated collateral values of collateral dependent impaired loans modified during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 exceeded the carrying amounts of such loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P90_S2	As a result, there were no charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans presented in the preceding tables for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P90_S3	There was one subsequent charge-off of $748,000 recorded in 2012 on a collateral dependent impaired loan presented in the preceding tables for the year ended December 31, 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $601,914,000 and $497,219,000, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $267,078,000 and $273,170,000, at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively), exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P97_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P99_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period-end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P115_S2	A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P115_S3	The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow-yield curve model specific to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P115_S4	The Company compares this rate to certain market indices, such as long-term treasury bonds, or the Citigroup pension liability indices, for reasonableness.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	Effective January 1, 2004, the Bank established a deferred compensation plan for executive management and key employees of the Bank, known as The Provident Bank Non-Qualified Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Supplemental ESOP ).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	The Supplemental ESOP was amended and restated as the Non-Qualified Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan (the Supplemental DC Plan ), effective January 1, 2010.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P128_S2	The Supplemental DC Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides additional benefits to certain executives whose benefits under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP are limited by tax law limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P128_S3	The Supplemental DC Plan requires a contribution by the Bank for each participant who also participates in the 401(k) Plan and ESOP equal to the amount that would have been contributed under the terms of the of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP but for the tax law limitations, less the amount actually contributed under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P128_S4	The Supplemental DC Plan provides for a phantom stock allocation for qualified contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified ESOP and for matching contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified 401(k) Plan due to tax law limitations.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	The fair value of the Company stock option awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock option.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a term approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	The expected volatility computation is based on historical volatility over a period approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P136_S3	The dividend yield is based on the annual dividend payment per share, divided by the grant date stock price.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	The expected option term is a function of the option life and the vesting period.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	The fair value of the option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $3.37, $3.74 and $2.91 per option, respectively.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans secured by real estate located in New Jersey.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in local real estate market conditions.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	(15) Regulatory Capital Requirements FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P147_S3	Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank is required to maintain (i) a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets of 4.00%, and (ii) minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and 8.00%, respectively.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00%; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00%; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P151_S3	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P151_S4	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P152_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P153_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P153_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	The following is a summary of the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, compared to the FDIC minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P156_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P156_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P156_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P157_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P157_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P159_S2	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P162_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P163_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P164_S1	For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P164_S3	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case-by-case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, as well as adjustments for estimated costs to sell of up to 6%.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P164_S4	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell of up to 6%.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P165_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P165_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P167_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P171_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P172_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P173_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P174_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P174_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P174_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P175_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P175_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P175_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P175_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P175_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P176_S0	by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P176_S1	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P177_S0	The carrying value of FHLB-NY stock was its cost.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P177_S1	The fair value of FHLB-NY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P177_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P178_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P178_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P178_S3	The fair value of performing loans was estimated using a combination of techniques, including a discounted cash flow model that utilizes a discount rate that reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P178_S4	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans was based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its non-performing loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S3	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, was equal to the amount payable on demand and classified as Level 1.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S4	The estimated fair value of certificates of deposit was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P179_S5	The discount rate was estimated using the Company s current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its certificates of deposit portfolio as Level 2.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P180_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and is classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P180_S2	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	PROVIDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Years Ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P184_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	The following tables present the Company s financial instruments at their carrying and fair values as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P185_S1	Fair values are presented by level within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following tables are a summary of certain quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.

1178970_13_ITEM8_P187_S1	Anti-dilutive stock options and awards totaling 3,891,443 and 3,739,767 shares at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, were excluded from the earnings per share calculations.
1178970_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	The following table presents the components of other comprehensive (loss) income both gross and net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P0_S0	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P1_S0	There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The management of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P3_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework .
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Based on the assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2012, the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1178970_13_ITEM9A_P3_S3	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012.

1178970_13_ITEM15_P7_S0	EXHIBIT 10.20 Written Description of Provident Financial Services, Inc. s 2013 Annual Cash Incentive Plan 2013 Cash Incentive Compensation.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S0	On January 31 2013, the Board of Directors of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), on the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, approved an annual performance-based incentive program for the payment of incentive cash compensation to certain officers and employees of The Provident Bank, the Company s wholly owned savings bank subsidiary, including senior executive officers.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S1	Cash incentive payments will be based primarily on the Company s 2013 financial performance compared with certain targets (the Corporate Targets ).
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S2	Incentive payments based on the Company s 2013 financial performance may be made if the Company meets or exceeds 95% of any of the Corporate Targets ( Threshold ).
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S3	For senior executive officers (including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer), 100% of the incentive payment that may be made will be based on the Company s 2013 financial performance using the following Corporate Targets that relate to the Company s business plan and strategic objectives: (i) earnings per share (weighted 25%); (ii) net income (weighted 25%); (iii) efficiency ratio (weighted 25%); and (iv) return on average assets (weighted 25%).
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S4	For other officers and employees eligible to participate, a portion of the incentive payment that may be made will be based on the Company s 2013 performance using the same Corporate Targets.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S5	A portion of the incentive payment will also be based on individual performance against personal goals and objectives, and may be paid whether or not Corporate Targets have been met.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S6	Incentive payments will be a percentage of the employee s base salary.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P8_S7	Using estimated 2013 base salary levels and the current number of employees that could participate, the total cash incentive payments that may be made for 2013 would range from approximately $3.9 million at the Threshold level up to $13.0 million at the Maximum level.
1178970_13_ITEM15_P9_S0	EXHIBIT 10.21 FORM OF THREE-YEAR CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT THIS CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENT is dated this day of (the Initial Effective Date ), between Provident Financial Services, Inc.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	In most cases, for the single family/condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	Funding requirements and loan structure for residential for rent projects vary depending on whether such projects are vertical or horizontal construction.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Bank originates consumer loans that are secured, in most cases, by a borrower s assets.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P30_S8	In 2013 , $31.0 million, or 25.3% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P30_S9	All of the loans sold in 2013 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P30_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P30_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P30_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Commercial real estate loans were 27.3 % of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2013 .

1178970_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P33_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P33_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P34_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P34_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	Among the reasons for the Bank s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S4	The Bank performs more extensive diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P35_S5	The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P36_S5	The Bank s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $2.5 million be completed at least every 18 months, or more frequently when warranted.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family mortgage lending.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	For all construction loans, the Bank requires an independent appraisal, which includes information on market rents and/or comparable sales for competing projects.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Bank also obtains personal guarantees and conducts environmental due diligence as appropriate.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	On commercial construction projects that the developer maintains for rental, the Bank typically holds back funds for tenant improvements until a lease is executed.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	For single family/condominium financing, the Bank generally requires payment for the release of a unit that exceeds the amount of the loan advance attributable to such unit.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Bank s largest construction loan as of December 31, 2013 was a $28.0 million loan secured by a first lien on a new 250 unit luxury multi-family apartment project located in Woolwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P49_S3	The project is approximately 90% complete with 149 units leased and occupied.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P49_S4	The loan has a risk rating of 4 (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2013 .

1178970_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower s business.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	Consumer loans generally entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of home equity loans and lines of credit secured by second lien positions, consumer loans that are unsecured or that are secured by assets that tend to depreciate, such as automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	Collateral repossessed by the Bank from a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, and the remaining deficiency may warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent upon the borrower s continued financial stability, and which is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P58_S3	Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount the Bank can recover on such loans.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P60_S6	Loans in excess of these limits, or which when combined with existing credits of the borrower or related borrowers exceed these limits, are presented to the management Credit Committee for approval.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P60_S7	The Credit Committee currently consists of seven senior officers including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Lending Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Credit Officer, and requires a majority vote for credit approval.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	While the Bank discourages loan policy exceptions, from time to time, based upon reasonable business considerations exceptions to the policy may be warranted.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	The business reason and mitigants for the exception must be noted on the loan approval document.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	The policy exception requires the approval of the Chief Lending Officer or the Department Manager of the lending department responsible for the underlying loan, if it is within his or her approval authority limit.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	All other policy exceptions must be approved by the Credit Committee.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the credit risk assessment of its loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Bank s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed accordingly.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S3	Similarly, the Credit Committee can adjust a risk rating.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S4	Quarterly, management s Credit Risk Management Committee meets to review all loans rated a watch ("5") or worse.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S5	In addition, a loan review examination is performed by an independent third party which validates the risk ratings.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S6	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P63_S7	The risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	The regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P64_S2	The Bank s current internal policy limit on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers that constitute a group exposure is up to $80.0 million for loans with a risk rating of 2 or better, $70.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "3" and $50.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "4".
1178970_14_ITEM1_P64_S3	The Bank reviews these group exposures on a quarterly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P64_S4	The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	The borrower, headquartered in New Jersey, is an experienced real estate owner and developer in New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	Management has determined that this exception to the internal group exposure policy limit is manageable and is mitigated by the borrower s diverse revenue mix, as well as its reputation and proven successful track record.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P66_S2	This lending relationship was approved as an exception to the internal policy limits by the management Credit Committee and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, and conformed to the regulatory limit applicable to the Bank at the time of loan origination.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	In addition to maintaining sound credit standards for new loan originations, the Bank employs proactive collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent or problem loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	The Bank actively markets properties that it acquires through foreclosure or otherwise in the loan collection process.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	In the case of residential mortgage and consumer loans, the collections personnel in the Bank s Asset Recovery Department are responsible for collection activities from the sixteenth day of delinquency.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	Collection efforts include automated notices of delinquency, telephone calls, letters and other notices to delinquent borrowers.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Periodic inspections of real estate and other collateral are conducted throughout the collection process.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Bank s collection procedures for Federal Housing Association ( FHA ) and Veteran s Administration ( VA ) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection guidelines outlined by those agencies.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	The Bank attempts to sell the property at foreclosure sale or as soon as practical after the foreclosure sale through a proactive marketing effort.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The collection procedures for commercial real estate and commercial loans include sending periodic late notices and letters to a borrower once a loan is past due.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The Bank attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan is 16 days past due, usually by telephone.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	The Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer review all commercial real estate and commercial loan delinquencies on a weekly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	Generally, delinquent commercial real estate and commercial loans are transferred to the Asset Recovery Department for further action if the delinquency is not cured within a reasonable period of time, typically 60 to 90 days.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	The Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer have the authority to transfer performing commercial real estate or commercial loans to the Asset Recovery Department if, in their opinion, a credit problem exists or is likely to occur.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Delinquent Loans and Non-performing Loans and Assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	The Bank s policies require that the Chief Credit Officer continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolios and report to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	These reports include information on impaired loans, delinquent loans, criticized and classified assets, and foreclosed assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P75_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P75_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for TDRs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , there were 152 impaired loans totaling $106.4 million, of which 142 loans totaling $89.4 million were TDRs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Included in this total were 115 TDRs to 110 borrowers totaling $58.2 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P77_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P78_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P78_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P78_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P79_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P80_S2	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	The policy statement provides updated guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2013 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described previously.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	At December 31, 2013 , $137.4 million of loans were classified as substandard, which consisted of $ 55.0 million in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, $ 46.7 million in commercial loans, $ 23.0 million in residential loans, $ 8.4 million in construction loans and $ 4.2 million in consumer loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P82_S2	At that same date, loans classified as doubtful totaled $ 649,000 , consisting solely of commercial loans.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans decreased $ 10.4 million, to $ 18.7 million at December 31, 2013 , from $ 29.1 million at December 31, 2012 .

1178970_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P88_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P88_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The factors considered in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the following:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	duration of the current business cycle.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S2	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S3	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S4	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S5	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S6	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P93_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P94_S5	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type, as well as qualitative and environmental factors such as:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	effects of changes in credit concentration.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	In the second quarter of 2013, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	As a result of that evaluation, GVA percentages applied to residential mortgage, first-lien home equity loans and commercial mortgage loans were reduced to reflect the decrease in the historical loss experience.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S4	In addition, multi-family loans were segregated from other commercial mortgage loans as a result of differing risk characteristics and were assigned GVA percentages accordingly.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P95_S5	Multi-family GVAs were established at levels lower than when previously included with other commercial mortgage loans as a result of lower historical loss experience resulting from the diverse cash flow sources supporting these loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P97_S3	As a result of this process, management has established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P97_S4	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is warranted based on factors such as the geographic concentration of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and imprecision related to collateral valuations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S4	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S5	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P98_S6	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P99_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P100_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P100_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P100_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P100_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S2	The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S8	The investment strategy considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S9	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P101_S10	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P102_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P102_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P102_S3	Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P102_S4	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P103_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P103_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P103_S2	If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P103_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P104_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P104_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P104_S2	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P104_S3	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P105_S0	interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S0	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S1	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S2	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S3	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S4	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S5	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S6	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S7	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S8	At December 31, 2013 , the Bank held $27.5 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P106_S9	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_14_ITEM1_P137_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P137_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has the authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P137_S4	However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will have back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P137_S5	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P138_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P138_S1	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in: (1) real estate mortgages; (2) consumer and commercial loans; (3) specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; (4) certain types of corporate equity securities; and (5) certain other assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P138_S2	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P139_S0	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P139_S1	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P139_S2	New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P139_S3	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P139_S4	See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P140_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P140_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P140_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P141_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P141_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P141_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P142_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P142_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P142_S2	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P142_S3	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P143_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P144_S0	FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P144_S1	The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P144_S2	Tier 1 capital is comprised of:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P145_S0	minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P146_S0	Tier 2 capital is comprised of:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P147_S0	up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P147_S1	The allowance for loan losses may be includible in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P147_S2	Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P148_S0	The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition, with a rating of 1 (the highest examination rating of the FDIC for banks) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth, of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P148_S1	For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S0	The FDIC regulations also establish a risk-based capital standard.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S1	The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S2	In determining the amount of a bank s risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 100%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S3	The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing such bank s capital adequacy.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S4	Under such a risk assessment, examiners will evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P149_S5	According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P150_S0	the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P150_S1	Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to maintain additional capital.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S3	In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that will revise their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S4	Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P151_S5	The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P152_S0	The rule limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P152_S1	The final rule also implements the Dodd-Frank Act s directive to apply to savings and loan holding companies consolidated capital requirements that are not less stringent than those applicable to their subsidiary institutions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P152_S2	The final rule is effective January 1, 2015.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P152_S3	The capital conservation buffer will be phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P153_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P153_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P153_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P154_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S2	The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P155_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $1.7 million.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P156_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P157_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P157_S1	An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P157_S2	Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P158_S0	The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P159_S0	No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P160_S0	On May 22, 2009, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P160_S1	The amount of the special assessment for any institution did not exceed 10 basis points times the institution s assessment base for the second quarter of 2009.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P160_S2	The Bank paid this special assessment in the amount of $3.1 million on September 30, 2009.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P161_S0	On November 12, 2009, the FDIC issued a rule that required depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P161_S1	These assessments were payable on December 30, 2009.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P161_S2	The total prepaid assessment of $31.3 million was remitted to the FDIC on that date.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P161_S3	Of that amount, $27.4 million was recorded as a prepaid asset as of December 31, 2009.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P161_S4	Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, the Company recorded an expense for its regular assessment for each quarter, with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset until it was fully expensed.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P162_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P162_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P162_S2	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that establishes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P162_S3	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P163_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P163_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P164_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P164_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P164_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P165_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P166_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P166_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P167_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P168_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P168_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P168_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P169_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P169_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P170_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P170_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P170_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P171_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P172_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P172_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P172_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P172_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P173_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P174_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P174_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of August 2011.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P174_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P174_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P175_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P175_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P176_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P176_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P176_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P176_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P177_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P177_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P177_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P177_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P178_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P179_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P180_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P180_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P181_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P182_S0	An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P183_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P183_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P183_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P183_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P184_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P184_S1	The previously discussed final rule that will increase capital requirements will adjust the prompt action categories accordingly.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P184_S2	Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following in order to qualify as well capitalized: (1) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5%; (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules) and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from the current rules).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P185_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P186_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P186_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P187_S0	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P188_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P189_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities to a savings bank of its directors and executive officers and of corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P189_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S1	The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $13.3 million and up to $89.0 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $89.0 million.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S2	The first $13.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P190_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P191_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P192_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P192_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P192_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted to various aspects of internet banking, and have indicated their intention to reevaluate their regulations to ensure that they encourage banks efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P192_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P193_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P194_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P194_S1	This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P195_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P195_S1	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P196_S0	A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective on July 1, 2011, repealed the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P196_S1	The legislation also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P197_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P197_S1	The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P198_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act contained the so-called Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge or private equity funds ( covered funds ).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P198_S1	On December 13, 2013, federal agencies issued a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule which, among other things, requires banking organizations to restructure and limit certain of their investments in and relationships with covered funds.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P198_S2	The final rule unexpectedly included within the interests subject to its restrictions collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities ( TRUPs CDOs ).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P198_S3	Many banking organizations had purchased such instruments because of their favorable tax, accounting and regulatory treatment and would have been subject to unexpected write-downs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P199_S0	TRUPS CDOs issued before May 19, 2010 if (i) acquired by a banking organization on or before December 10, 2013 and (ii) the organization reasonably believed the proceeds from the TRUPS CDOs were invested primarily in any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued by a depository institution holding company with less than $15 billion in assets or by a mutual holding company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P199_S1	Neither the Company nor the Bank have investments in covered funds or TRUPS CDOs.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P200_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P200_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P200_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis structured similarly, but not identically, to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P201_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company s total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P202_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P202_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P202_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P203_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P203_S1	The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P203_S2	Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks will apply to bank holding companies (with greater than $500 million of assets) as of January 1, 2015.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P203_S3	As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P204_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P204_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P205_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P205_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P206_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P206_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P207_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P208_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P209_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P209_S1	The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P209_S2	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if:
1178970_14_ITEM1_P210_S0	the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board that it elects to become a financial holding company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P211_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P211_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P212_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P212_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P212_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P213_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P214_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P214_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P215_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P215_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P215_S2	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P215_S3	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P215_S4	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P216_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P216_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P217_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2013 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P218_S6	At December 31, 2013 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $21.2 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P219_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_14_ITEM1_P219_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P219_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P220_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P220_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P221_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P221_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P221_S2	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P222_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P222_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P223_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P223_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P223_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_14_ITEM1_P223_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	In the ordinary course of operating our business, we are exposed to a variety of risks inherent to the financial services industry.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The following discusses the significant risk factors that could affect our business and operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price for your investment in the Company s common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment in the Company s common stock.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Adverse conditions in the housing sector and related markets and prolonged elevated unemployment levels may adversely affect our business and financial results.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	While we did not invest in sub-prime mortgages and related investments, our lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied, in large part, to the housing market.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Lower home prices, a heightened level of foreclosures, the protracted foreclosure process in New Jersey and high unemployment have adversely impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and collateral values.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The housing slump contributed to a reduced demand for the construction of single-family housing, declines in home prices, and elevated delinquencies on residential and commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	These conditions may potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	A worsening of these negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Our strategy continues to be to increase our commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S6	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S7	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S8	At December 31, 2013, the average loan size for a construction loan was $3.5 million, for a commercial mortgage loan was $2.1 million, and for a commercial loan was $354,000, compared to an average loan size of $160,000 for a single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S9	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S12	Our success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S13	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S14	The local economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, including an unemployment rate of 7.3% at December 31, 2013, have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S15	Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P2_S16	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, depressed real estate values and real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	These small- to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P3_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P3_S3	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S4	Our emphasis on the continued diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P4_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	If rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S4	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 7.3% or $16.0 million.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets, and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S8	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S9	At December 31, 2013, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.16 billion.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P6_S12	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments are not available to reinvest at prevailing market rates at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain lower borrowing costs.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	Historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Federal Reserve Board continues to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which has resulted in increases in net interest income in the short term.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The Federal Reserve Board has indicated its intention to maintain an accommodative monetary policy in the near future.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may decrease, which may have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We record all assets and liabilities acquired by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	At December 31, 2013, goodwill totaling $352.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S4	A Company has the option to qualitatively determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a two step quantitative impairment analysis.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P13_S5	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P14_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P15_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Further declines in the value of certain investment securities could require an other-than-temporary impairment charge which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Our securities portfolio includes securities that have declined in value due to the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related and weaker credit performance of collateral underlying such securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S7	These securities include private label mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P17_S8	A prolonged decline in the value of these securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger of Team Capital Bank into The Provident Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	On December 20, 2013, we announced the proposed merger of Team Capital Bank with and into The Provident Bank, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The proposed merger remains subject to regulatory approvals, as well as approval by the stockholders of Team Capital Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We anticipate completing the merger in the second quarter of 2014.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The success of the proposed merger will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of Team Capital Bank and The Provident Bank in a manner that does not materially disrupt the customer relationships of both banks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	If we are unable to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S5	The Provident Bank and Team Capital Bank have operated and, until completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S6	It is possible that the integration process related to the proposed merger may result in the loss of key personnel, the disruption of our business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that may adversely impact our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S7	We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S8	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S9	As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S10	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S11	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S12	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P19_S13	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created a new consumer financial protection bureau, tightened capital standards and resulted in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act may still not be known for some time.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	However, it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations may materially increase our operating and compliance costs.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Banks such as ours with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulators.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	The final rules implementing these requirements, in addition to increasing regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Bank, will take effect on January 1, 2015, with certain aspects of the final rule being transitioned through 2019.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S5	In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P25_S6	Risks associated with cyber-security, system failures, interruptions, or other breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Information technology systems are critical to our business.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, financial reporting, securities investments, deposits, and loans.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	The occurrence of any system failures, interruption, disruption of power and communication services, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S4	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S5	Our risk management program may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S6	Our risk management program is designed to minimize risk and loss to us.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S7	We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S8	While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S9	Recent economic conditions and heightened regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P29_S10	Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Acts of terrorism, severe weather and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Additionally, recent severe weather-related events have adversely impacted customers in our market area, especially those in areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, cause disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S4	While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P31_S5	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In particular, over the past decade, New Jersey has experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_14_ITEM1A_P32_S5	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_14_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	Property At December 31, 2013 , the Bank conducted business through 77 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties, New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate net book value of premises and equipment was $ 66.4 million at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	In the first quarter of 2011, the Company s executive offices were relocated to a leased facility at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey, which is also the Bank s Main Office .
1178970_14_ITEM2_P0_S3	This was necessitated by the relocation of the Bank s administrative offices from 830 Bergen Avenue, Jersey City, New Jersey to a leased facility at 100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey, which was completed during the second quarter 2011.
1178970_14_ITEM2_P0_S4	The Bank s 830 Bergen Avenue administrative office building and its former loan administration center building at 1000 Woodbridge Center Drive, Woodbridge, New Jersey were sold in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1178970_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol PFS.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	Trading in the Company s common stock commenced on January 16, 2003.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , there were 83,209,293 shares of the Company s common stock issued and 59,917,649 shares outstanding, and 5,415 stockholders of record.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	The table below shows the high and low closing prices reported on the NYSE for the Company s common stock, as well as the cash dividends paid per common share during the periods indicated.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 30, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, which was paid on February 28, 2014, to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 14, 2014.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company paid a special dividend of $0.20 per common share on December 31, 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company s Board of Directors intends to review the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, subject to financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, industry standards, economic conditions, regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and other relevant factors.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P1_S3	The Company is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P1_S4	If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or immediately preceding year.
1178970_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	Stock Performance Graph Set forth below is a stock performance graph comparing (a) the cumulative total return on the Company s common stock for the period December 31, 2008 through December 31, 2013 , (b) the cumulative total return on stocks included in the Russell 2000 Index over such period, and (c) the cumulative total return of the SNL Thrift Index over such period.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	General On January 15, 2003, the Company became the holding company for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a stock-chartered bank.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 77 full-service branches throughout northern and central New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2013 , commercial loans accounted for 66.3% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 33.7%.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial and industrial lending relationships.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	Core deposits, consisting of all savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	At December 31, 2013 , core deposits were 84.5 % of total deposits.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Acquisition On December 20, 2013, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement under which Team Capital Bank ("Team Capital") will merge with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	Consideration will be paid to Team Capital stockholders in a combination of stock and cash valued at approximately $122.0 million on the day of the announcement.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and Team Capital's stockholder approval.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	The merger will add twelve branches to The Provident Bank branch network, with five branches in Pennsylvania and seven in New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	On August 11, 2011, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary, The Provident Bank, completed its acquisition of Beacon Trust Company, a New Jersey limited purpose trust company, and Beacon Global Asset Management, Inc., an SEC-registered investment advisor incorporated in Delaware (collectively Beacon ).
1178970_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement announced on May 19, 2011, Beacon s former parent company, Beacon Financial Corporation, may be paid cash consideration in an amount up to $10.5 million, based upon the acquired companies financial performance in the three years following the closing of the transaction.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Subsequent to the acquisition, Beacon Global Asset Management was merged with and into Beacon Trust Company.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P10_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party and periodically, by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P13_S8	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type and other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries, loan volume, as well as the national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	In the second quarter of 2013, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	mortgage loans, first-lien home equity loans and commercial mortgage loans were reduced to reflect the decrease in the historical loss experience.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, multi-family loans were segregated from other commercial mortgage loans as a result of differing risk characteristics and were assigned GVA percentages accordingly.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	Multi-family GVAs were established at levels lower than when previously included with other commercial mortgage loans as a result of lower historical loss experience resulting from the diverse cash flow sources supporting these loans.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P16_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company qualitatively determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	The guidance provides certain factors an entity should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2013.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) was warranted.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	In this evaluation, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary securities impairment loss in 2013 and 2011, totaling $ 434,000 and $ 302,000 , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	No other-than-temporary securities impairment loss was incurred in 2012.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carryback years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	A valuation reserve of $1.1 million was established in 2009 pertaining primarily to state tax benefits on net operating losses at the Bank and unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	In 2011, management released the valuation allowance associated with the state net operating losses, approximately $840,000, due to expectation of current and future taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	At December 31, 2013, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $242,000, related to unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P36_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P36_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P37_S1	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P37_S2	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 Total assets increased $ 203.6 million, or 2.8 %, to $ 7.49 billion at December 31, 2013 , from $ 7.28 billion at December 31, 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	The increase was primarily due to increases in total loans, partially offset by a decline in total securities.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P39_S2	Total loans increased $ 290.1 million, or 5.9 %, to $ 5.19 billion at December 31, 2013 , from $ 4.90 billion at December 31, 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P39_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , loan originations totaling $ 1.77 billion and loan purchases of $ 34.8 million were partially offset by repayments of $ 1.47 billion and loan sales of $ 31.0 million.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P47_S4	In addition, growth in both average loans outstanding and non-interest bearing demand deposits has contributed to the improvement in earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was adversely impacted by the write-off of a deferred tax asset related to non-qualified stock options issued shortly after the Company's 2003 initial public offering, all of which expired unused in July 2013.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The write-off of the related $3.9 million deferred tax asset resulted in a $3.2 million charge to income tax expense and a $735,000 charge to equity in the third quarter of 2013.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S8	The decrease in interest income was attributable to a decrease in the yield on average earning assets, partially offset by an increase in average earning asset balances.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S9	The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 21 basis points to 3.87 % for 2013 , from 4.08 % for 2012 , with reductions in yields experienced in nearly all earning asset classes.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S12	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average interest-earning deposits, Federal funds sold and short-term investment balances of $ 16.8 million, to $ 16.8 million for 2013 , from $ 33.6 million for 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S13	Interest expense decreased $ 8.2 million, or 18.2 %, to $ 36.8 million for 2013 , from $ 44.9 million for 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S14	The decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower short-term interest rates coupled with a shift in the funding composition to lower-costing core deposits from certificates of deposit and a reduction in the average cost of borrowings.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P48_S15	This was partially offset by an increase in average borrowings, which replaced average deposit outflow and funded a portion of the growth in average interest-earning assets.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events change.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P50_S3	Management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses, if necessary, in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P50_S4	The Company s emphasis on continued diversification of the loan portfolio through the origination of commercial loans has been one of the more significant factors management has considered in evaluating the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses for the past several years.

1178970_14_ITEM7_P52_S13	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in average interest-earning deposits, Federal funds sold and short-term investment balances of $15.5 million, or 31.6%, to $33.6 million for 2012 , from $49.2 million for 2011 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P52_S14	Interest expense decreased $ 14.8 million, or 24.8 %, to $ 44.9 million for 2012 , from $ 59.7 million for 2011 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P52_S15	The decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower short-term interest rates coupled with a shift in the funding composition to lower-costing core deposits from certificates of deposit and a reduction in average borrowings, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposit balances.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P52_S16	The average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities decreased 30 basis points to 0.83% for 2012 , from 1.13% for 2011 .

1178970_14_ITEM7_P53_S13	The decrease was primarily due to a lower assessment rate and a change in assessment methodology from a deposit-based to an asset-based assessment, effective in the second quarter of 2012.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P53_S14	Net occupancy expense decreased $644,000 to $20.5 million, compared to the same period last year, due to the consolidation and relocation of the Company s administrative offices in April 2011 and the elimination of prior year carrying costs on previously occupied facilities owned by the Company that were sold in November 2011.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P53_S15	Additionally, amortization of intangibles decreased $564,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared with the same period of 2011 , as a result of scheduled reductions in core deposit intangible amortization, partially offset by the amortization of the customer relationship intangible arising from the Beacon acquisition.
1178970_14_ITEM7_P53_S16	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company s income tax expense was $28.9 million, compared with $19.8 million in 2011 .
1178970_14_ITEM7_P53_S17	The increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax income.

1178970_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The guidelines of the Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets and liabilities, earnings and capital.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal funds rate or LIBOR.

1178970_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitively priced within the marketplace.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB of New York during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P7_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2013 , in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 7.3 %, or $ 16.0 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 0.8 %, or $ 1.7 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2013 , in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 16.6 %, or $ 203.7 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P13_S1	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 5.7 %, or $ 70.6 million increase in the present value of equity.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P14_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM7A_P14_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	The following are included in this item: (A) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (B) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (C) Consolidated Financial Statements: (6) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (D) Provident Financial Services, Inc., Condensed Financial Statements: The supplementary data required by this Item (selected quarterly financial data) is provided in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company ) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P1_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P1_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P2_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Provident Financial Services, Inc. s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), and our report dated March 3, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.:
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s and subsidiary (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) (1992) .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S7	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P3_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the COSO.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 , and our report dated March 3, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P7_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P8_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), The Provident Bank (the Bank ) and their wholly owned subsidiaries.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P9_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P9_S2	Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform with current year classifications.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P9_S3	In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company elected to reclassify certain items on the statements of condition from between, and among other liabilities, deposits and escrow deposits.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P9_S4	This reclassification did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P10_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P12_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P14_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P14_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P15_S2	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 320 Investments-Debt and Equity Securities on April 1, 2009, to determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P15_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P15_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P16_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P16_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P17_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P17_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P18_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P21_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P22_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P23_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P24_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P24_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P25_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P26_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P28_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30 th .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S5	As permitted by GAAP, the Company prepares a qualitative assessment in determining whether goodwill may be impaired.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S6	The factors considered in the assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S7	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2013.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P31_S8	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis was warranted.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P32_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P33_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P35_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P37_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter and the amount of shares allocated during the quarter.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P37_S4	Expense related to time vesting stock awards and stock options is based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant and on the fair value of the stock options on the date of the grant, respectively, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Performance vesting stock awards and stock options are either dependent upon a market condition or a performance condition.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Market condition is a performance metric tied to a stock price, either on an absolute basis, or a relative basis against peers, while a performance condition is based on internal operations, such as earnings per share.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P38_S2	The expense related to a market condition performance vesting stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and is recognized ratably over the performance period.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P38_S3	The expense related to a performance condition stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted periodically based upon the number of awards or options expected to be earned, recognized over the performance period.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P39_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P74_S5	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) on debt securities for which a non-credit component of OTTI was recognized in other comprehensive income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	OTTI recognized in earnings after that date for credit-impaired debt securities is presented as an addition in two components, based upon whether the current period is the first time a debt security was credit-impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairment).

1178970_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	The following table represents the Company s disclosure on securities available for sale with temporary impairment (in thousands):
1178970_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	The Company does not have the intent to sell securities in a temporary loss position at December 31, 2013 , nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P79_S3	The following table summarizes the aging of loans receivable by portfolio segment and class as follows (in thousands):
1178970_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $76,680,000 and $98,990,000 at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P80_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2013 , or 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P80_S3	If the nonaccrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1,913,000 , $3,022,000 and $3,496,000 , for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P80_S4	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was not material for the periods presented.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P82_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P82_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analyses of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	A third party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P83_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P83_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P89_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P103_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P103_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S2	The Supplemental DC Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides additional benefits to certain executives whose benefits under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP are limited by tax law limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S3	The Supplemental DC Plan requires a contribution by the Bank for each participant who also participates in the 401(k) Plan and ESOP equal to the amount that would have been contributed under the terms of the of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP but for the tax law limitations, less the amount actually contributed under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S4	The Supplemental DC Plan provides for a phantom stock allocation for qualified contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified ESOP and for matching contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified 401(k) Plan due to tax law limitations.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S5	Under the Supplemental 401(k) provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $7,000 , $7,500 and $6,000 , respectively, and included the matching contributions plus interest credited at an annual rate equal to the ten-year bond-equivalent yield on U.S. Treasury securities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S6	Under the Supplemental ESOP provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $45,000 , $28,000 and $24,000 , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P142_S7	The phantom equity is treated as equity awards (expensed at the time of allocation) and not liability awards which would require periodic adjustment to market, as participants do not have an option to take their distribution in cash.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P143_S0	2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan Upon stockholders approval of the 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan on April 23, 2008, shares available for stock awards and stock options under the 2003 Stock Award Plan and the 2003 Stock Option Plan were reserved for issuance under the new 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P143_S3	Shares previously awarded under the 2003 plans that are subsequently forfeited or expire may also be issued under the new plan.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	Stock Awards As a general rule, restricted stock grants are held in escrow for the benefit of the award recipient until vested.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P144_S1	Awards outstanding generally vest in three or five annual installments, commencing one year from the date of the award.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	Expense attributable to stock awards amounted to $4,869,000 , $3,658,000 and $3,169,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	This amount will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.1 years.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	Each stock option granted entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price not less than the fair value of a share of the Company s common stock at the date of grant.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P147_S1	Options generally vest over a five -year period from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years following the grant date.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P147_S2	Additionally, certain options are three-year performance vesting options, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P147_S3	A summary of the status of the granted but unexercised stock options as of December 31, and changes during the year is presented below:

1178970_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	Compensation expense related to the Company s stock option plan totaled $297,000 , $452,000 and $751,000 for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P150_S2	The estimated fair values were determined on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	The fair value of the Company stock option awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock option.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a term approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P151_S2	The expected volatility computation is based on historical volatility over a period approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P151_S3	The dividend yield is based on the annual dividend payment per share, divided by the grant date stock price.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	The expected option term is a function of the option life and the vesting period.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	The fair value of the option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
1178970_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $3.49 , $3.37 and $3.74 per option, respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	(12) Income Taxes The current and deferred amounts of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_14_ITEM8_P156_S1	The Bank recorded, in accumulated other comprehensive income, a deferred tax expense (benefit) of $4,968,000 , ($694,000) and ($5,666,000) in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, related to the amortization of post-retirement obligations.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	A reconciliation between the amount of reported total income tax expense and the amount computed by multiplying the applicable statutory income tax rate is as follows (in thousands):
1178970_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	The net deferred tax asset is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	Retained earnings at December 31, 2013 includes approximately $51,800,000 for which no provision for income tax has been made.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	This amount represented an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S2	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include the failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to stockholders.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S3	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had an unrecognized tax liability of $21,160,000 with respect to this reserve.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had a valuation allowance of $242,000 related to approximately $648,000 of capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S5	As a result of the Beacon acquisition in 2011, the Company has acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which will be available to offset future taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S6	If not utilized, these carryforwards will expire in 2030.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P159_S7	Also, the Company has state net operating loss carryforwards in the amount of $4,000,000 which are scheduled to expire in 2033.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	Management has determined that it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset based upon the nature and timing of the items listed above.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	In order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	nerate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net deferred tax asset; however, there can be no assurance that such levels of taxable income will be generated.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	The Company s policy is to report interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P162_S2	The Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and each entity files a separate state income tax return.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Company and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years prior to 2010.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P166_S1	In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial position of the Company will not be materially affected by the outcome of such commitments or contingent liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans secured by real estate located in New Jersey.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P167_S1	Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in local real estate market conditions.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	(15) Regulatory Capital Requirements FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P168_S1	Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Bank is required to maintain (i) a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets of 4.00% , and (ii) minimum ratios of Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and 8.00% , respectively.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	Under its prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P169_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% ; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% ; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00% .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P172_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P172_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P174_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P175_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following is a summary of the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , compared to the FDIC minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P178_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P178_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P178_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P178_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P179_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P181_S1	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P181_S2	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P183_S1	he majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P183_S2	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P183_S3	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P184_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P184_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P185_S1	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P185_S2	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P186_S1	For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P186_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P186_S3	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case-by-case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, as well as adjustments for estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P186_S4	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P187_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P187_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P190_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1178970_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P193_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P196_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P196_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P199_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P199_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.

1178970_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and is classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P204_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_14_ITEM8_P205_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.

1178970_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s Principal Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Principal Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the Company s fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 .
1178970_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( COSO ) (1992).

1178970_14_ITEM15_P14_S0	On January 30, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors, on the recommendation of its Compensation Committee, approved an annual performance-based incentive plan for the payment of incentive cash compensation to certain officers (including senior executive officers) and employees of The Provident Bank, the Company s wholly owned subsidiary (the Plan ).
1178970_14_ITEM15_P14_S1	The Plan provides for cash incentive payments based primarily on the Company s 2014 financial performance compared with certain targets (the Corporate Targets ).
1178970_14_ITEM15_P14_S2	Incentive Payments based on the Company s 2014 financial performance may be made if the Company meets or exceeds 95% of any of the Corporate Targets ( Threshold ).
1178970_14_ITEM15_P15_S0	For senior executive officers (including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer), 100% of the incentive payment that may be made under the Plan will be based on the Company s 2014 performance using the following Corporate Targets that relate to the Company s business plan and strategic objectives: (i) earnings per share (weighted 25%); (ii) net income (weighted 25%); (iii) efficiency ratio (weighted 25%); and (iv) return on average assets (weighted 25%).
1178970_14_ITEM15_P16_S0	For other officers and employees eligible to participate in the Plan, a portion of the incentive payment that may be made under the Plan will be based on the Company s 2014 performance using the same Corporate Targets.
1178970_14_ITEM15_P16_S1	A portion of the incentive payment will also be based on individual performance against personal goals and objectives, and may be paid whether or not Corporate Targets have been met.

1178970_14_ITEM15_P17_S1	Using estimated 2014 base salary levels and the current number of employees that could participate in the Plan (485 persons), the total cash incentive payments that may be made for 2014 would range from approximately $2.4 million at the Threshold level up to $13.1 million at the Maximum level.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Because of the diversity of industries within the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	The northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits has come from several commercial banks and savings banks in its market area.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	Certain of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund and investment advisory industries and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S5	The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiaries.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P15_S6	Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank s branch network, its deployment of branch ATMs, and its mobile, telephone and web-based banking services.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	The Bank commonly retains biweekly payment fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with a maturity of 30 years or less and a majority of the originated adjustable rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	Generally, these loans have maturities of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	For loans greater than $5.0 million originated with maturities in excess of 7 years, the bank generally requires loan-level interest rate swaps.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Bank has historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects, including residential for rent projects, that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P20_S2	In most cases, for the single family and condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P20_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	Funding requirements and loan structure for residential for-rent projects vary depending on whether such projects are vertical or horizontal construction.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P27_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 62.1% were fixed-rate and 37.9% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P28_S2	Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Bank has offered adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P28_S4	In October 2009, the Bank discontinued the origination of one- and three-year adjustable rate mortgage loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2 3 / 4 %, adjusting annually after its first re-set period, with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 30 years or less.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S8	In 2014 , $12.6 million or 16.7% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S9	All of the loans sold in 2014 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P30_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $31.9 million.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P31_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $4.9 million for the past five years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P31_S3	The Bank does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	loans were 28.2 % of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	A substantial majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P34_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Among the reasons for the Bank s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S2	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S4	The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S5	The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P36_S6	If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	Generally, for commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $1.0 million and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank requires environmental experts to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Bank requires a full independent appraisal for commercial real estate in accordance with regulatory guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	The appraiser must be selected from the Bank s approved list, or otherwise approved by the Chief Credit Officer in instances such as out-of-state or special use property.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	The Bank also employs an independent review appraiser to ensure that the appraisal meets the Bank s standards.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, financial statements are required annually for review.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P38_S4	The Bank s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $2.5 million be completed at least every 18 months, or more frequently when warranted.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Bank s largest commercial mortgage loan as of December 31, 2014 was a $27.9 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 378 room, full service hotel and a 422 car parking garage located in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	The loan has a risk rating of 4 (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Bank underwrites loans secured by apartment buildings that have five or more units.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P40_S1	The Bank considers multi-family lending a component of the commercial real estate lending portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P40_S2	The underwriting standards and procedures that are used to underwrite commercial real estate loans are used to underwrite multi-family loans, except the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property, the debt-service coverage should be a minimum of 1.15 times and an amortization period of up to 30 years may be used.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Bank s largest multi-family loan as of December 31, 2014 was a $39.8 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a newly constructed 250-unit luxury multi-family apartment project located in Woolwich Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	The project sponsors have extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of multi-family projects.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	The loan has a risk rating of 2 (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Bank originates commercial construction loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	Commercial construction lending includes both new construction of residential and commercial real estate projects and the reconstruction of existing structures.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	The Bank s commercial construction financing takes two forms: projects that are constructed for investment purposes (rental property) and projects for sale (single family/condominiums).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	or condominiums be under contract to support construction loan advances; and requires other covenants on residential for rent projects depending on whether the project is vertical or horizontal construction.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Bank underwrites construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	The majority of the Bank s construction loans are floating-rate loans with a maximum 75% loan-to-value ratio for the completed project.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	The Bank employs professional engineering firms to assist in the review of construction cost estimates and make site inspections to determine if the work has been completed prior to the advance of funds for the project.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate or multi-family lending.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower s business.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	The Bank s largest commercial loan as of December 31, 2014 was a $38.0 million line of credit to a general contracting company specializing in bridge and highway construction with a risk rating of "3" (loans rated 1-4 are deemed acceptable quality -see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section).

1178970_15_ITEM1_P60_S1	Collateral repossessed by the Bank from a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, and the remaining deficiency may warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent upon the borrower s continued financial stability, and which is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the credit risk assessment of its loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S1	The Bank s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S2	When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed accordingly.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	Risk ratings are subject to review by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S4	Similarly, the Credit Committee can adjust a risk rating.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S5	Quarterly, management s Credit Risk Management Committee meets to review all loans rated a watch ("5") or worse.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S7	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P64_S8	The risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	The regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the regulatory lending limit was $110.4 million.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	The Bank s current internal policy limit on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers that constitute a group exposure is up to $80.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "2 " or better, up to $70.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "3" and up to $50.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "4".

1178970_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	The borrower, headquartered in New Jersey, is an experienced real estate owner and developer in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	Management has determined that this exception to the internal group exposure policy limit is manageable and is mitigated by the borrower s diverse revenue mix, as well as its reputation and proven successful track record.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	This lending relationship was approved as an exception to the internal policy limits by the management Credit Committee and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, and conformed to the regulatory limit applicable to the Bank at the time of loan origination.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	In the case of residential mortgage and consumer loans, the collections personnel in the Bank s Asset Recovery Department are responsible for collection activities from the sixteenth day of delinquency.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	Collection efforts include automated notices of delinquency, telephone calls, letters and other notices to delinquent borrowers.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P69_S2	Foreclosure proceedings and other appropriate collection activities such as repossession of collateral are commenced within at least 90 to 120 days after a loan is delinquent provided a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency cannot be reached with the borrower.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P69_S3	Periodic inspections of real estate and other collateral are conducted throughout the collection process.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Bank s collection procedures for Federal Housing Association ( FHA ) and Veteran s Administration ( VA ) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection guidelines outlined by those agencies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	The Bank attempts to sell the property at foreclosure sale or as soon as practical after the foreclosure sale through a proactive marketing effort.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P74_S2	These reports include information on impaired loans, delinquent loans, criticized and classified assets, and foreclosed assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P75_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P75_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for TDRs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , there were 147 impaired loans totaling $85.4 million, of which 143 loans totaling $81.7 million were TDRs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	Included in this total were 123 TDRs to 120 borrowers totaling $54.8 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P77_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P78_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P78_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	General valuation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P83_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P83_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2014 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described previously.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	At December 31, 2014 , $ 110.4 million of loans were classified as substandard, which consisted of $ 53.8 million in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, $ 32.8 million in commercial loans, $ 17.2 million in residential loans, $ 2.6 million in construction loans and $ 3.9 million in consumer loans.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Non-performing commercial loans decreased $ 9.9 million, to $ 12.3 million at December 31, 2014 , from $ 22.2 million at December 31, 2013 .

1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S9	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans increased $ 1.4 million to $ 20.0 million at December 31, 2014 , from $ 18.7 million at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S10	At December 31, 2014 , the Company held 16 non-performing commercial mortgage loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S11	The largest non-performing commercial mortgage loan was a $12.3 million loan secured by a first mortgage on a 200,000 square foot office/industrial building located in Eatontown, New Jersey, which had been negatively impacted by the loss of a major tenant that relied upon contracts with the Federal government.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S12	The loan was previously restructured and matured on June 1, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S13	The loan maturity was not extended and the loan is presently in default.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S14	There is no contractual commitment to advance additional funds to this borrower.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S15	At December 31, 2014 , the Company held $ 5.1 million of foreclosed assets, compared with $ 5.5 million at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S16	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2014 are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S17	Foreclosed assets consisted of $2.7 million of commercial real estate, $2.3 million of residential properties, and $60,000 of marine vessels at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S18	Non-performing assets totaled $ 59.0 million, or 0.69 % of total assets at December 31, 2014 , compared to $ 82.2 million, or 1.10 % of total assets at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P88_S19	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2014 was not material.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P90_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P90_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	The factors considered in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses include the following:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	duration of the current business cycle.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S3	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S4	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S5	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S6	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P95_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P96_S5	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type, as well as qualitative and environmental factors such as:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S1	In the second quarter of 2014, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S2	As a result of that evaluation, certain GVA percentages applied to residential mortgage, commercial, multi-family and commercial mortgage loans were reduced to reflect the decrease in the historical loss experience and improvements in qualitative factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S3	In addition, GVA percentages for marine loans were increased due to historical loss experience.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S4	During the fourth quarter of 2014, management made certain changes and enhancements to its process and controls over measuring the GVA portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S5	In connection with its periodic risk assessment and monitoring process, the Company re-evaluated a number of assumptions supporting the methodology including the look-back period used to evaluate the historical loss factors for its portfolios, as well as performing a study of its loss emergence period ("LEP") data.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S6	As a result of this review, management updated a number of assumptions, including lengthening its LEP given continued improvements in market conditions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S7	Given these changes to the quantitative methodology, management reassessed its qualitative and environmental factors to align with the revised model assumptions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S8	The result of these changes was to allocate a greater portion of the allowance to the quantitative component of the GVA and less to the qualitative component.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P97_S9	The changes had no impact on the overall allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P99_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P99_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P99_S3	As a result of this process, management has established an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P99_S4	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is warranted based on factors such as the geographic concentration of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and imprecision related to collateral valuations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S4	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S5	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P100_S6	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P101_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P101_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P102_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P102_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P102_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P102_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P102_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S2	The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S8	The investment strategy considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S9	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P103_S10	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P104_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P104_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P104_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P104_S3	Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P104_S4	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P105_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P105_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P105_S2	If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P105_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P106_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P107_S0	the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P107_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P107_S2	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S9	At December 31, 2014 , the Bank held $5.7 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P108_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P137_S1	The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as its deposit insurer.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P137_S2	The Bank files reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P138_S0	Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P138_S1	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P138_S2	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P139_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S1	Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are impacting the Company and the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has the authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S4	However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will have back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P140_S5	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P141_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.

1178970_15_ITEM1_P141_S2	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P142_S0	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of leeway investments.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P142_S1	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P142_S2	New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P142_S3	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P142_S4	See Federal Banking Regulation Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P143_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P143_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P143_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P144_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P144_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P144_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P145_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P145_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P146_S0	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P146_S1	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P147_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P148_S0	FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P148_S1	The FDIC regulations define two tiers, or classes, of capital.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P148_S2	Tier 1 capital is comprised of:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P149_S0	minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries minus all intangible assets, other than qualifying servicing rights and any net unrealized loss on marketable equity securities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P150_S0	Tier 2 capital is comprised of:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P151_S0	up to 45% of pre-tax net unrealized holding gains on available for sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P151_S1	The allowance for loan losses may be includible in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P151_S2	Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital that may be included in total capital cannot exceed 100% of Tier 1 capital.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P152_S0	The FDIC regulations establish a minimum leverage capital requirement for banks in the strongest financial and managerial condition, with a rating of 1 (the highest examination rating of the FDIC for banks) under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth, of not less than a ratio of 3.0% of Tier 1 capital to total assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P152_S1	For all other banks, the minimum leverage capital requirement is 4.0%, unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S0	The FDIC regulations also establish a risk-based capital standard.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S1	The risk-based capital standard requires the maintenance of a ratio of total capital, which is defined as the sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4%.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S2	In determining the amount of a bank s risk-weighted assets, all assets, plus certain off balance sheet items, are multiplied by a risk-weight of 0% to 200%, based on the risks the FDIC believes are inherent in the type of asset or item.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S3	The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of a bank s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing such bank s capital adequacy.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S4	Under such a risk assessment, examiners will evaluate a bank s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P153_S5	According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P154_S0	the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P154_S1	Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to maintain additional capital.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P155_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P155_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P155_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P156_S0	In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revises their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P156_S1	Among other things, the rule establishes a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), adopts a uniform minimum leverage capital ratio of 4%, increases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P156_S2	The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain available-for-sale securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-in or opt-out is exercised.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P157_S0	The rule limits a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P157_S1	The final rule is effective January 1, 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P157_S2	The capital conservation buffer will be phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P158_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P158_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P158_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P159_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S2	The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of New York, is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLB stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P160_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , dividends paid by the FHLB to the Bank totaled $1.7 million.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P161_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P162_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P162_S1	An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P162_S2	Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P163_S0	The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P164_S0	No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P165_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P165_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P165_S2	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that establishes a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P165_S3	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P166_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P166_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P167_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P167_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P167_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P168_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P169_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P169_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P170_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P171_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P171_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P171_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P172_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P172_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P173_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P173_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P173_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P174_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P175_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P176_S0	assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P176_S1	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P176_S2	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P177_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P178_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P178_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of August 2011.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P178_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P178_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P179_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P179_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P180_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P180_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P180_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P180_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P181_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P181_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P181_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P181_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P182_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P183_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P184_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% (3% if the bank receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System) and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P184_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P185_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% (or less than 3% if the institution receives the highest rating under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P186_S0	An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P187_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P187_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P187_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P187_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P188_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P188_S1	The previously discussed final rule that increased capital requirements effective January 1, 2015 adjusts the prompt action categories accordingly.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P188_S2	Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as well capitalized : (1) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% (new standard); (2) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules) and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from the current rules).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P189_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P190_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P190_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P190_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P191_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P192_S0	related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P192_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S1	The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $14.5 million and up to $103.6 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $103.6 million.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S2	The first $14.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P193_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P194_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P195_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P195_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P195_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted to various aspects of internet banking, and have indicated their intention to re-evaluate their regulations to ensure that they encourage banks efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P195_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P196_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P197_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) was enacted.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P197_S1	This law has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and is affecting the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P198_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P198_S1	The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for some time.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P199_S0	A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective on July 1, 2011, repealed the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P199_S1	The legislation also provided for originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred credits, directed the Federal Reserve Board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage origination.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P200_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called golden parachute payments.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P200_S1	The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act contained the so-called Volcker Rule, which generally prohibits banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and from investing in, sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge or private equity funds ( covered funds ).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S1	On December 13, 2013, federal agencies issued a final rule implementing the Volcker Rule which, among other things, requires banking organizations to restructure and limit certain of their investments in and relationships with covered funds.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S2	The final rule unexpectedly included within the interests subject to its restrictions collateralized debt obligations backed by trust-preferred securities ( TRUPs CDOs ).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S3	Many banking organizations had purchased such instruments because of their favorable tax, accounting and regulatory treatment and would have been subject to unexpected write-downs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S4	In response to concerns expressed by community banking organizations, the federal agencies subsequently issued an interim final rule which grandfathers TRUPS CDOs issued before May 19, 2010 if (i) acquired by a banking organization on or before December 10, 2013 and (ii) the organization reasonably believed the proceeds from the TRUPS CDOs were invested primarily in any trust preferred security or subordinated debt instrument issued by a depository institution holding company with less than $15 billion in assets or by a mutual holding company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P201_S5	Neither the Company nor the Bank have investments in covered funds or TRUPS CDOs.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P202_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P202_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P203_S0	affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis structured similarly, but not identically, to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P204_S6	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company s total capital and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P205_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating Regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P205_S1	In calculating Tier 1 risk-based capital and Total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P205_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P206_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act directs the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P206_S1	The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P206_S2	Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies (with greater than $500 million of assets) as of January 1, 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P206_S3	As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P207_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P207_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P208_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P208_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P209_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P209_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P210_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P211_S0	order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P211_S1	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P211_S2	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P211_S3	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P211_S4	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P212_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P213_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P213_S1	Financial holding companies may engage in a broader array of activities including insurance and investment banking.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P214_S0	The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014 which was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve Board on March 5, 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P214_S1	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if at the time of the election and on a continuing basis:
1178970_15_ITEM1_P215_S0	each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P216_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P216_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P217_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P217_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P217_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P218_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P219_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P219_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P219_S2	Investment Adviser Regulation Following the acquisition of the MDE Group, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC, each of Beacon Investment Advisory Services, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC will be investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P219_S3	As such, they will be required to make certain filings with and be subject to periodic examination by, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P220_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P220_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P221_S0	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P221_S1	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P221_S2	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P222_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P222_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P223_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2014 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P224_S6	At December 31, 2014 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $21.2 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P225_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_15_ITEM1_P225_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P225_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P226_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P226_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P227_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P227_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Company had approximately $3,900,000 of Federal Net Operating Losses ("NOLs").
1178970_15_ITEM1_P227_S2	These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P228_S0	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P229_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P229_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of apportioned taxable income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S4	Due to the acquisition of Team Capital in the current year, the Bank is now subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax.
1178970_15_ITEM1_P230_S5	Mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5 percent on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P0_S1	The Federal Reserve Board continues to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and until recently, the purchase of mortgage-backed securities.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which has resulted in increases in net interest income in the short term.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may decrease, which may have an adverse affect on our profitability.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In the event the Federal Reserve Board changes its current stance by increasing short-term rates and long-term rates remain low, we may experience a flattening or inverted yield curve that would negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	If rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S6	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 4.0% or $9.8 million.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S7	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S8	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S9	At December 31, 2014, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.07 billion.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S10	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S11	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P2_S12	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments cannot be reinvested at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain lower borrowing costs.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	We are subject to liquidity risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost within acceptable risk tolerances.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan commitments to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; the sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews and credit risk ratings, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Our emphasis on the continued diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S6	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S8	A downturn in the housing sector and related markets and elevated unemployment levels may adversely affect our business and financial results.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Our lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied in large part to the housing market.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Lower home prices, a heightened level of foreclosures, the protracted foreclosure process or elevated unemployment levels would adversely impact the credit performance of real estate related loans and collateral values.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S11	These conditions could potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S12	Such negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S13	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S14	A significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S15	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S16	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, multi-family loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S17	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S18	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S19	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S20	Our success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, and with the acquisition of Team Capital Bank in 2014, eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S21	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers mostly located in our primary markets.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S22	Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S23	Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P8_S24	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, depressed real estate values and real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These small- to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processers, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S7	The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P11_S8	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, the occurrence of systems failures and disruptions, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S5	In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S6	We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S7	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S8	As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S9	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S10	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and our management of risks posed by our reliance on third party vendors.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S11	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P12_S12	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P13_S3	The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tightened capital standards and resulted in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act ) has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The federal agencies were given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act are still not known.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P14_S3	However, we expect the legislation and implementing regulations may materially increase our operating and compliance costs.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P15_S1	As we approach $10 billion in assets, we will be required to incur additional costs to address these additional requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires minimum leverage (Tier 1) and risk-based capital requirements for bank and savings and loan holding companies that are no less than those applicable to banks, and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	The final rules implementing these requirements, will increase the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	These final rules became effective on January 1, 2015, with certain aspects of the final rules being phased in through 2019.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Our risk management program may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Our risk management program is designed to minimize risk and loss to us.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring, modeling and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Recent economic conditions and heightened regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S6	We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of a recently announced wealth management acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S7	On January 5, 2015, we announced the proposed acquisition of The MDE Group, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC by Beacon Trust Company, our wholly owned subsidiary.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S8	The proposed acquisition remains subject to regulatory approvals.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S9	We anticipate completing the acquisition in the second quarter of 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S10	The success of the proposed acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine the businesses of MDE/Acertus and Beacon Trust in a manner that does not materially disrupt the customer relationships of either company.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S11	If we are unable to successfully achieve this objective, the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P19_S12	MDE/Acertus and Beacon Trust have operated and, until completion of the acquisition, will continue to operate, independently.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	It is possible that the integration process related to the proposed acquisition may result in the loss of key personnel, the disruption of our existing or the acquired business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that may adversely impact its ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees, or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A general economic slowdown could adversely impact our wealth management fee income A general economic slowdown could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income and the departure of clients to seeking alternative investment opportunities with other wealth managers.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	In particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S6	Acts of terrorism, severe weather and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P21_S7	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Additionally, severe weather-related events have adversely impacted customers in our market area, especially those in areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, cause disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	At December 31, 2014, goodwill totaling $392.8 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S3	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S4	A company has the option to qualitatively determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a two step quantitative impairment analysis.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P25_S5	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P29_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P29_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P29_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_15_ITEM1A_P29_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_15_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	Property At December 31, 2014 , the Bank conducted business through 86 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.

1178970_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 86 full-service branches throughout northern and central New Jersey, as well as Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2014 , these commercial loan types accounted for 69.4% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 30.6%.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial lending relationships.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	Core deposits, consisting of all savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	At December 31, 2014 , core deposits were 85.7 % of total deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	Acquisitions On October 31, 2014, Beacon acquired the fiduciary account relationships of a bank in Suffolk County, New York.

1178970_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	Team Capital was merged with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank as of the close of business on the date of acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	The merger added twelve branches to The Provident Bank branch network, with five branches in Pennsylvania and seven in New Jersey.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P10_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P10_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P10_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P12_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party and periodically, by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P13_S8	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management assigns general valuation allowance ( GVA ) percentages to each risk rating category for use in allocating the allowance for loan losses, giving consideration to historical loss experience by loan type and other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries, loan volume, as well as the national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P14_S1	The appropriateness of these percentages is evaluated by management at least annually and monitored on a quarterly basis, with changes made when they are required.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P14_S2	In the second quarter of 2014, management completed its most recent evaluation of the GVA percentages.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	loss experience and improvements in qualitative factors.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, GVA percentages for marine loans were increased due to historical loss experience.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2014, management made certain changes and enhancements to its process and controls over measuring the GVA portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S3	In connection with its periodic risk assessment and monitoring process, the Company re-evaluated a number of assumptions supporting the methodology including the look-back period used to evaluate the historical loss factors for its portfolios, as well as performing a study of its loss emergence period ("LEP") data.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	As a result of this review, management updated a number of assumptions, including lengthening its LEP given continued improvements in market conditions.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	Given these changes to the quantitative methodology, management reassessed its qualitative and environmental factors to align with the revised model assumptions.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S6	The result of these changes was to allocate a greater portion of the allowance to the quantitative component of the GVA and less to the qualitative component.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P15_S7	The changes had no impact on the overall allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at current elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P16_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P17_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Company qualitatively determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	The guidance provides certain factors an entity should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) was warranted.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P30_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	Turmoil in the credit markets resulted in a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	In this evaluation, no other-than-temporary securities impairment loss was incurred in 2014 and 2012, while in 2013, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary securities impairment loss of $434,000.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carryback years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $242,000, related to unused capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
1178970_15_ITEM7_P36_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P36_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.

1178970_15_ITEM7_P49_S14	The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in average borrowings, which funded a portion of the growth in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by a shift in the funding composition to lower-costing core deposits from time deposits and a reduction in the average cost of borrowings.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P49_S15	Also offsetting the increase in interest expense was a $ 120.5 million, or 14.4 % increase in average non-interest bearing demand deposits to $ 959.8 million for 2014 , from $ 839.3 million for 2013 .

1178970_15_ITEM7_P51_S1	The amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events change.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P51_S2	Management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses, if necessary, in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM7_P51_S3	The Company s emphasis on continued diversification of the loan portfolio through the origination of commercial loans has been one of the more significant factors management has considered in evaluating the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses for the past several years.

1178970_15_ITEM7_P51_S17	BOLI income decreased $963,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 , principally due to lower death benefits recognized in the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013, partially offset by income recognized on BOLI assets acquired from Team Capital.

1178970_15_ITEM7A_P6_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2014 , in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 4.0 %, or $ 9.8 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 1.4 %, or $ 3.5 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2014 , in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 11.2 %, or $ 146.7 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 4.2 %, or $ 54.8 million increase in the present value of equity.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P13_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P13_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM7A_P13_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	The following are included in this item: (A) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (B) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (C) Consolidated Financial Statements: (6) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (D) Provident Financial Services, Inc., Condensed Financial Statements: The supplementary data required by this Item (selected quarterly financial data) is provided in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.: We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company ) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P1_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P1_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P2_S3	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P2_S4	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ), and our report dated March 2, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Board of Directors and Stockholders Provident Financial Services, Inc.:
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S1	We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s and subsidiary (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) (1992) .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S2	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S3	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S4	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S5	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S6	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S7	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P3_S8	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P4_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P4_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the COSO.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P5_S1	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements of financial condition of Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 , and our report dated March 2, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

1178970_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ), The Provident Bank (the Bank ) and their wholly owned subsidiaries.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P9_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P9_S2	Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform with current year classifications.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P12_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P14_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P15_S2	In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 320 Investments-Debt and Equity Securities on April 1, 2009, to determine if a decline in value is other-than- temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P15_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P15_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P18_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P18_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P19_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLB at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P21_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P22_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P23_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P23_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Purchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI ) loans, are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, with no allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P24_S2	The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value of the PCI loans at acquisition represents the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P24_S3	Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition represent the non-accretable discount and are not recognized as a yield adjustment or a valuation allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P24_S4	Reclassifications of the non-accretable to accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to an increase in expected cash flows of the loans and results in an increase in interest income on a prospective basis.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P27_S1	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P27_S2	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P31_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30 th .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S5	As permitted by GAAP, the Company prepares a qualitative assessment in determining whether goodwill may be impaired.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S6	The factors considered in the assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S7	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P34_S8	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis was warranted.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P37_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P41_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter and the amount of shares allocated during the quarter.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Bank has an Equity Plan designed to provide competitive compensation for demonstrated performance and to align the interests of participants directly to increases in shareholder value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Equity Plan provides for performance-vesting grants as well as time-vesting grants.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	Time-vesting stock awards, stock options and performance vesting stock awards that are based on a performance condition, such as Earnings Per Share are valued on the closing stock price on the date of grant.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P42_S3	Performance vesting stock awards and options that are based on a market condition, such as Total Shareholder Return, would be valued using a generally accepted statistical technique to simulate future stock prices for Provident and the components of the Peer Group which Provident would be measured against.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	Expense related to time vesting stock awards and stock options is based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant and on the fair value of the stock options on the date of the grant, respectively, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Performance vesting stock awards and stock options are either dependent upon a market condition or a performance condition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	A market condition performance metric is tied to a stock price, either on an absolute basis, or a relative basis against peers, while a performance-condition is based on internal operations, such as earnings per share.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S2	The expense related to a market condition performance-vesting stock award or stock option requires an initial Monte Carlo simulation to determine grant date fair value, which will be recognized as a compensation expense regardless of actual payout, assuming that the executive is still employed at the end of the requisite service period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S3	If pre-vesting termination (forfeiture) occurs, then any expense recognized to date can be reversed.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S4	The grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the performance period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P44_S5	The expense related to a performance condition stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted periodically based upon the number of awards or options expected to be earned, recognized over the performance period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P45_S3	These accounts will be liquidated as shares are distributed from the DDFP in accordance with the plan document.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P45_S4	At December 31, 2014 , there were 406,883 shares held by the DDFP.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Bank maintains a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain executives who are prevented from receiving the full benefits contemplated by the 401(k) Plan s and the ESOP s benefit formulas under tax law limits for tax-qualified plans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Bank provides postretirement health care and life insurance plans to certain of its employees.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P47_S1	The life insurance coverage is noncontributory to the participant.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P47_S2	Participants contribute to the cost of medical coverage based on the employee s length of service with the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P47_S3	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	On December 31, 2002, the Bank eliminated postretirement healthcare benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	Currently, none of the Company s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	The existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P50_S4	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	Other comprehensive income includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	Segment Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing to its customers traditional banking and other financial services.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	These potentially dilutive shares would then be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Shares issued and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-14, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors: Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	The amendments in this update affect creditors that hold government guaranteed mortgage loans, including those guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	The amendments in this update require that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met (i) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure, (ii) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim, and (iii) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	Upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Company does not anticipate a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements related to this guidance.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Company will comply with the provisions of this guidance upon its effective date and, if applicable, record a separate other receivable for foreclosed government guaranteed mortgage loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period," which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The amendments can be applied prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S3	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S4	Also in June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, "Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures" which aligns the accounting for repurchase to maturity transactions and repurchase agreements executed as a repurchase financing with the accounting for other typical repurchase agreements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S5	Going forward, these transactions would all be accounted for as secured borrowings.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S6	This update is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S7	In addition the disclosure of certain transactions accounted for as a sale is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods beginning after March 15, 2015.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S8	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this update will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S9	The objective of this amendment is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S10	This update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S11	For public entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P60_S12	The Company does not anticipate a material impact to the consolidated financial statements related to this guidance.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	In January 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-04, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure, which clarifies that an in-substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure, or the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	Additionally, this ASU requires interim and annual disclosure of both the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	ASU No. 2014-04 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P61_S3	The Company s adoption of ASU No. 2014-04 is not expected to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	On January 15, 2003, the Bank completed its plan of conversion, and the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company sold 59.6 million shares of common stock (par value $0.01 per share) at $10.00 per share.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company received net proceeds in the amount of $567.2 million .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P62_S3	In connection with the Bank s commitment to its community, the plan of conversion provided for the establishment of a charitable foundation.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P62_S4	Provident donated $4.8 million in cash and 1.92 million of authorized but unissued shares of common stock to the foundation, which amounted to $24.0 million in aggregate.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company recognized an expense, net of income tax benefit, equal to the cash and fair value of the stock during 2003.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	Conversion costs were deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the shares sold in the offering.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	Upon completion of the plan of conversion, a liquidation account was established in an amount equal to the total equity of the Bank as of the latest practicable date prior to the conversion.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	priority claim to the assets of the Bank to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders as defined in the Plan, who continue to maintain deposits in the Bank after the conversion.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event, each eligible account holder and supplemental eligible account holder would receive a liquidation distribution, prior to any payment to the holder of the Bank s common stock.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P64_S2	This distribution would be based upon each eligible account holder s and supplemental eligible account holder s proportionate share of the then total remaining qualifying deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P64_S3	At December 31, 2014 , the liquidation account, which is an off-balance sheet memorandum account, amounted to $15.7 million .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	On May 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Team Capital Bank ("Team Capital"), which after purchase accounting adjustments added $964.0 million to total assets, $631.2 million to loans, and $769.9 million to deposits.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	Total consideration paid for Team Capital was $115.1 million : $31.6 million in cash and 4.9 million shares of common stock valued at $83.5 million on the acquisition date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	Team Capital was merged with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank as of the close of business on the date of acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S3	The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S4	Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, net of tax.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S5	The excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P65_S6	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition from Team Capital, net of cash consideration paid (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	The calculation of goodwill is subject to change for up to one year after the date of acquisition as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties become available.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	As the Company finalizes its review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	Fair Value Measurement of Assets Assumed and Liabilities Assumed The methods used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Team Capital acquisition were as follows:
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The estimated fair values of the investment securities classified as available for sale were calculated utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	Management reviewed the data and assumptions used by its third party provider in pricing the securities to ensure the highest level of significant inputs is derived from observable market data.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S2	These prices were validated against other pricing sources and broker-dealer indications.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S3	The acquired loan portfolio was valued based on current guidance which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S4	Level 3 inputs were utilized to value the portfolio and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and the incorporated assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S5	In instances where reliable market information was not available, the Company used its own assumptions in an effort to determine reasonable fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S6	Specifically, Management utilized three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value adjustment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P68_S7	The three separate fair valuation methodologies used were: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value adjustment; and 3) specific credit fair value adjustment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	To prepare the interest rate fair value analysis, loans were grouped by characteristics such as loan type, term, collateral and rate.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Market rates for similar loans were obtained from various external data sources and reviewed by Company management for reasonableness.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	The average of these rates was used as the fair value interest rate a market participant would utilize.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S3	A present value approach was utilized to calculate the interest rate fair value adjustment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S4	The general credit fair value adjustment was calculated using a two part general credit fair value analysis: 1) expected lifetime losses; and 2) estimated fair value adjustment for qualitative factors.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S5	The expected lifetime losses were calculated using an average of historical losses of the Company, the acquired bank and peer banks.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P69_S6	The adjustment related to qualitative factors was impacted by general economic conditions and the risk related to lack of familiarity with the originator's underwriting process.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	To calculate the specific credit fair value adjustment, management reviewed the acquired loan portfolio for loans meeting the definition of an impaired loan with deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Loans meeting this definition were reviewed by comparing the contractual cash flows to expected collectible cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P70_S2	The aggregate expected cash flows less the acquisition date fair value resulted in an accretable yield amount.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P70_S3	The accretable yield amount will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Deposits and Core Deposit Premium Core deposit premium represents the value assigned to demand, interest checking, money market and savings accounts acquired as part of an acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	The core deposit premium value represents the future economic benefit, including the present value of future tax benefits, of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost alternative funding sources and was valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	Time deposits are not considered to be core deposits as they are assumed to have a low expected average life upon acquisition.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The fair value of time deposits represents the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted by market rates for similar time deposits and was valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	The fair value for borrowed funds was obtained from actual prepayment rates from the FHLB - Pittsburgh, a Level 2 input.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P72_S3	These borrowings were redeemed after the acquisition date and the fair value adjustment was fully amortized in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	(3) Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks Included in cash on hand and due from banks at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $20,502,000 and $21,052,000 , respectively, representing reserves required by banking regulations.

1178970_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	Also excluded from the table above are equity securities of $ 397,000 at amortized cost and $ 524,000 at fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	During 2014 , proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale were $24,509,000 , resulting in gross gains of $632,000 and gross losses of $404,000 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	Also, for the year ended December 31, 2014, proceeds from calls on securities available for sale totaled $740,000 , with gross gains of $2,000 and no gross losses recognized.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	For the 2013 period, proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale were $14,310,000 resulting in gross gains of $888,000 and no losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P84_S5	Also, for the year ended December 31, 2013, proceeds from calls on securities available for sale totaled $896,000 , with no gross gains or losses recognized.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company estimates the loss projections for each non-agency mortgage-backed security by stressing the individual loans collateralizing the security and applying a range of expected default rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds in conjunction with the underlying credit enhancement for each security.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) on debt securities for which a non-credit component of OTTI was recognized in other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	OTTI recognized in earnings after that date for credit-impaired debt securities is presented as an addition in two components, based upon whether the current period is the first time a debt security was credit-impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairment).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities were as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company did not incur a net other-than-temporary impairment charge on securities for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	During the 2014 period, the Company realized a $59,000 gain and a $365,000 loss on the sale of previously impaired non-Agency mortgage-backed securities, respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S2	The Company previously incurred cumulative credit losses of $1.7 million on these securities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S3	For the prior year period, the Company incurred a $434,000 subsequent net other-than-temporary impairment charge on a previously impaired non-Agency mortgage-backed security.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S4	Prior to these charges, any impairment was considered temporary and was recorded as an unrealized loss on securities available for sale and reflected as a reduction of equity, net of tax, through accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P87_S5	The following table represents the Company s disclosure on securities available for sale with temporary impairment (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S3	The Company does not have the intent to sell securities in a temporary loss position at December 31, 2014 , nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S4	The number of securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2014 totaled 43 , compared with 76 at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S5	There were two private label mortgage-backed security in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2014 , with an amortized cost of $1,800,000 and unrealized losses totaling $16,200 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P88_S6	Both private label mortgage-backed securities were investment grade at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	(6) Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized over the lives of the loans as an adjustment to yield.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	Required reductions due to loan prepayments are charged against interest income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , $694,000 , $1,286,000 and $1,694,000 , respectively, decreased interest income as a result of prepayments and normal amortization.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P90_S3	The following table summarizes the aging of loans receivable by portfolio segment and class of loans , excluding PCI loans (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $53.9 million and $76.7 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P91_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2014 , or 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P91_S3	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1,877,000 , $1,913,000 and $3,022,000 , for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P91_S4	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was not material for the periods presented.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analyses of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	A third party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P94_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses as a result of this process.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	At December 31, 2014 , there were 147 impaired loans totaling $85.4 million , of which 143 loans totaling $81.7 million were TDRs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	Included in this total were 123 TDRs related to 120 borrowers totaling $54.8 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	At December 31, 2013 , there were 152 impaired loans totaling $106.4 million , of which 142 loans totaling $89.4 million were TDRs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	Included in this total were 115 TDRs related to 110 borrowers totaling $58.2 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	Loans receivable summarized by portfolio segment and impairment method, excluding PCI loans are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	The allowance for loan losses is summarized by portfolio segment and impairment classification, excluding PCI loans as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	The following tables present the number of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and their balances immediately prior to the modification date and post-modification as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as previously discussed.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	Estimated collateral values of collateral dependent impaired loans modified during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 exceeded the carrying amounts of such loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	As a result, there were no charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans presented in the preceding tables for the years ended December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S3	The allowance for loan losses associated with the TDRs presented in the preceding tables totaled $419,000 and $1.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively and were included in the allowance for loan losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S4	The TDRs presented in the preceding tables had a weighted average modified interest rate of approximately 4.58% and 4.08% , compared to a yield of 5.69% and 5.75% prior to modification for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P103_S5	The following table presents loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months from December 31, 2014 and 2013 , and for which there was a payment default (90 days or more past due) during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1178970_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	TDRs that subsequently default are considered collateral dependent impaired loans and are evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less expected selling costs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	PCI loans are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	As part of the Team Capital acquisition, $5.2 million of the loans purchased at May 30, 2014 were determined to be PCI loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	PCI loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, with no related allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	The following table presents information regarding the estimates of the contractually required payments, the cash flows expected to be collected and the estimated fair value of the PCI loans acquired from Team Capital at May 30, 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	PCI loans declined $710,000 to $4.5 million at December 31, 2014, from $5.2 million at acquisition from Team Capital on May 30, 2014, largely due to the full repayment and greater than projected cash flows on certain PCI loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P107_S1	This resulted in a $348,000 increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to the acceleration of accretable and non-accretable discount on these loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P107_S2	The following table summarizes the changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	The activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 is as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	The activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	Impaired loans receivable by class, excluding PCI loans are summarized as follows (in thousands):

1178970_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	At December 31, 2013 , impaired loans consisted of 152 residential, commercial and commercial mortgage loans totaling $106,370,000 , of which 37 loans totaling $48,204,000 were included in nonaccrual loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	Specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses attributable to impaired loans totaled $7,127,000 and $10,217,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P111_S3	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for loan losses totaled $18,346,000 and $21,958,000 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P111_S4	The average balances of impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 were $87,869,000 , $111,008,000 and $115,611,000 , respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $908,581,000 and $657,563,000 , at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $300,029,000 and $252,522,000 , at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively) exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P116_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P116_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	Collateral and/or guarantees are required for virtually all loans.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P117_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	Loans receivable by credit quality risk rating indicator, excluding PCI loans are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_15_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Bank uses securities available for sale to pledge as collateral for the repurchase agreements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P133_S0	The Bank has a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering its full-time employees who had attained age 21 with at least one year of service as of April 1, 2003.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P133_S1	The pension plan was frozen on April 1, 2003.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P134_S0	All participants in the pension plan are 100% vested.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	The pension plan s assets are invested in investment funds and group annuity contracts currently managed by the Principal Financial Group and Allmerica Financial.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P134_S2	Based on the measurement date of December 31, 2014 , management believes that no contributions will be made to the pension plan in 2015 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	In an effort to lower and reduce the volatility of its future pension costs, the Company offered a lump sum pension distribution option to its vested terminated employees in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P135_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Plan paid $4.3 million to those employees that elected to receive lump sum pension distributions and the Company realized an associated charge of $1.3 million .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P135_S2	This charge was a pro rata share of the unrecognized losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	In addition to pension benefits, certain healthcare and life insurance benefits are currently made available to certain of the Bank s retired employees.

1178970_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% ; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% ; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00% .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P187_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P187_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P187_S3	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P187_S4	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P188_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P189_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	The following is a summary of the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	The following is a summary of the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , compared to the FDIC minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P192_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P192_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P192_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P192_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P193_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P195_S1	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P195_S2	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	he majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P197_S3	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P198_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P199_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P199_S2	Currently, none of the Company s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P199_S3	The existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P199_S4	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs, which are considered Level 2 inputs.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P201_S3	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case-by-case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, as well as adjustments for estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P201_S4	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P202_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P205_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P208_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P211_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P211_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P212_S6	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	The carrying value of FHLBNY stock was its cost.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P213_S1	The fair value of FHLBNY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P214_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P214_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P214_S3	The fair value of performing loans was estimated using a combination of techniques, including a discounted cash flow model that utilizes a discount rate that reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P214_S4	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans was based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its non-performing loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S3	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, was equal to the amount payable on demand and classified as Level 1.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S4	The estimated fair value of certificates of deposit was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P215_S5	The discount rate was estimated using the Company s current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its certificates of deposit portfolio as Level 2.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P216_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and is classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P217_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P217_S2	Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P217_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P218_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P218_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P219_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P219_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following tables present the Company s financial instruments at their carrying and fair values as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P220_S1	Fair values are presented by level within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	The following tables are a summary of certain quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the outstanding shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	Anti-dilutive stock options and awards totaling 988,931 , 659,531 and 3,891,443 shares at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, were excluded from the earnings per share calculations.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	The following table presents the components of other comprehensive income (loss) both gross and net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	The following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P226_S0	The following table summarizes the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013(in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P227_S0	(1) This item is included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S1	The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S2	The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S3	The Company s existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S4	The Company manages a matched book with respect to its derivative instruments in order to minimize its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P228_S5	The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	Fair Value Derivatives not designated as a hedging instruments:
1178970_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	None of the Company s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P230_S1	Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers, which the Company implemented during 2014.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P231_S0	The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P231_S1	Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P231_S2	As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P231_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company had nine interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $94.9 million related to this program.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	The tables below present the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands).
1178970_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	Year ended December 31, 2014 Derivatives not designated as a hedging instruments:
1178970_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well / adequate capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $2,084,000 .
1178970_15_ITEM8_P235_S1	The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral of $1,250,000 against its obligations under these agreements.
1178970_15_ITEM8_P235_S2	If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2014 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s Principal Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Principal Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2014 .
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	During the fourth quarter management identified a material weakness in internal control relating to the determination of the qualitative factors considered by management in the allowance for loan loss estimation process.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	No restatement of prior period financial statements and no change in previously released financial results were required as a result of this finding.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Management remediated this weakness by enhancing the documentation and controls over the process supporting the qualitative factors considered in the estimation of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Except for the foregoing, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting in the quarter ended December 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( COSO ) (1992).

1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S1	The Plan provides for cash incentive payments based primarily on the Company s 2015 financial performance compared with certain targets (the Corporate Targets ).
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S2	Incentive Payments based on the Company s 2015 financial performance may be made if the Company meets or exceeds 90% of any of the Corporate Targets ( Threshold ).
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S3	For senior executive officers (including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer), 100% of the incentive payment that may be made under the Plan will be based on the Company s 2015 performance using the following Corporate Targets that relate to the Company s business plan and strategic objectives: (i) earnings per share (weighted 40%); (ii) net income (weighted 40%); and (iii) efficiency ratio (weighted 20%).
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S4	For other officers and employees eligible to participate in the Plan, a portion of the incentive payment that may be made under the Plan will be based on the Company s 2015 performance using the same Corporate Targets.
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S5	A portion of the incentive payment will also be based on individual performance against personal goals and objectives, and may be paid whether or not Corporate Targets have been met.
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S6	Incentive payments will be a percentage of the employee s base salary.
1178970_15_ITEM15_P16_S7	Using estimated 2015 base salary levels and the current number of employees that could participate in the Plan (520 persons), the total cash incentive payments that may be made for 2015 would range from approximately $1.8 million at the Threshold level up to $13.3 million at the Maximum level.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P8_S13	The Bank also offers investment, wealth and asset management services through its subsidiaries to generate non-interest income.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Because of the diversity of industries within the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Generally, these loans have maturities of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	For loans greater than $5.0 million originated with maturities in excess of 7 years, the Bank generally requires loan-level interest rate swaps.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Bank has historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects, including residential for rent projects, that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	In most cases, for the single family and condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 62.7% were fixed-rate and 37.3% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2.75%, adjusting annually after its first re-set period, with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S8	In 2015 , $3.9 million or 3.3% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P34_S9	All of the loans sold in 2015 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P35_S2	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $21.8 million.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $7.6 million for the past five years.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P38_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P38_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	Among the reasons for the Bank s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S2	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S3	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S4	The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S5	The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P40_S6	If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Generally, for commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $1.0 million and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank requires environmental professionals to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Bank s largest multi-family loan as of December 31, 2015 was a $41.0 million loan secured by a first lease-hold mortgage lien on a newly renovated 129-unit, six story class A luxury rental apartment building with 12,000 square feet of office/retail space located in Morristown, New Jersey.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	To mitigate the speculative nature of construction loans, the Bank generally requires significant pre-leasing on rental properties; requires that a percentage of the for-sale single-family residences or condominiums be under contract to support construction loan advances; and requires other covenants on residential for rent projects depending on whether the project is vertical or horizontal construction.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Bank underwrites construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	The majority of the Bank s construction loans are floating-rate loans with a maximum 75% loan-to-value ratio for the completed project.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P46_S2	The Bank employs professional engineering firms to assist in the review of construction cost estimates and make site inspections to determine if the work has been completed prior to the advance of funds for the project.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate or multi-family lending.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	For all construction loans, the Bank requires an independent appraisal, which includes information on market rents and/or comparable sales for competing projects.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	The Bank also obtains personal guarantees and conducts environmental due diligence as appropriate.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Bank also employs other means to mitigate the risk of the construction lending process.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	On commercial construction projects that the developer maintains for rental, the Bank typically holds back funds for tenant improvements until a lease is executed.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	For single family and condominium financing, the Bank generally requires payment for the release of a unit that exceeds the amount of the loan advance attributable to such unit.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P51_S2	The Bank s largest construction loan at December 31, 2015 was a $23.8 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 138,600 square foot freezer warehouse which is under construction in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P51_S3	The loan had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM1_P51_S4	Construction of the project is approximately 30% complete.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	The project's sponsors have extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of commercial real estate.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	The loan has a risk rating of 4 (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality -see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2015 .

1178970_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower s business.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P55_S1	As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P55_S2	The Bank s largest commercial loan as of December 31, 2015 was a $38.0 million line of credit to a general contracting company specializing in bridge and highway construction with a risk rating of "3" (loans rated 1-4 are deemed acceptable quality -see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section).

1178970_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Collateral repossessed by the Bank from a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, and the remaining deficiency may warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P59_S2	In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent upon the borrower s continued financial stability, and which is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P61_S5	The largest individual lending authority is $10.0 million, which is only available to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Lending Officer.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P61_S6	The authority of the Chief Lending Officer may be increased to $15.0 million for permanent commercial real estate loans when combined with the additional approval of the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P61_S7	Loans in excess of these limits, or which when combined with existing credits of the borrower or related borrowers exceed these limits, are presented to the management Credit Committee for approval.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P61_S8	The Credit Committee currently consists of eight senior officers including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Lending Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Credit Officer, and requires a majority vote for credit approval.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	While the Bank discourages loan policy exceptions, from time to time, based upon reasonable business considerations exceptions to the policy may be warranted.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	The business reason and mitigants for the exception must be noted on the loan approval document.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The policy exception requires the approval of the Chief Lending Officer or the Department Manager of the lending department responsible for the underlying loan, if it is within his or her approval authority limit.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	All other policy exceptions must be approved by the Credit Committee.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the credit risk assessment of its loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	The Bank s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed accordingly.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	Risk ratings are subject to review by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S4	Similarly, the Credit Committee can adjust a risk rating.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S5	Quarterly, management s Credit Risk Management Committee meets to review all loans rated a watch ("5") or worse.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S6	In addition, a loan review examination is performed by an independent third party which validates the risk ratings on a sample basis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S7	The Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P65_S8	The risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	The regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the regulatory lending limit was $114.8 million.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S2	The Bank s current internal policy limit on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers that constitute a group exposure is up to $80.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "2" or better, up to $70.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "3", and up to $50.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "4".
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S3	Maximum group exposure limits may be lower depending on the type of loans involved.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S4	The Bank reviews these group exposures on a quarterly basis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S5	The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S6	At December 31, 2015 , the Bank s largest group exposure with an individual borrower and its related entities was $81.2 million, consisting of 15 commercial permanent mortgage loans totaling $69.2 million, secured by 10 first mortgage liens and five second mortgage liens on 10 commercial real estate properties located in northern New Jersey with an average risk rating of 3 , as well as a $12.0 million acquisition and renovation loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 135,500 square foot retail shopping center in Little Ferry, New Jersey with a risk rating of "3".
1178970_16_ITEM1_P66_S7	As of December 31, 2015, this loan had an outstanding balance of $8.0 million.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	The borrower, headquartered in New Jersey, is an experienced real estate owner and developer in the state of New Jersey.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P67_S1	Management has determined that this exception to the internal group exposure policy limit is manageable and is mitigated by the borrower s diverse revenue mix, as well as its reputation and proven successful track record.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P67_S2	This lending relationship was approved as an exception to the internal policy limits by the management Credit Committee and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, and conformed to the regulatory limit applicable to the Bank at the time the loan was originated.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	In the case of residential mortgage and consumer loans, the collections personnel in the Bank s Asset Recovery Department are responsible for collection activities from the sixteenth day of delinquency.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	Collection efforts include automated notices of delinquency, telephone calls, letters and other notices to delinquent borrowers.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	Foreclosure proceedings and other appropriate collection activities such as repossession of collateral are commenced within at least 90 to 120 days after a loan is delinquent provided a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency cannot be reached with the borrower.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	Periodic inspections of real estate and other collateral are conducted throughout the collection process.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Bank s collection procedures for Federal Housing Association ( FHA ) and Veteran s Administration ( VA ) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection guidelines outlined by those agencies.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P71_S1	The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P71_S2	The Bank attempts to sell the property at foreclosure sale or as soon as practical after the foreclosure sale through a proactive marketing effort.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	These reports include information on impaired loans, delinquent loans, criticized and classified assets, and foreclosed assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P76_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P76_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for TDRs.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , there were 148 impaired loans totaling $50.9 million, of which 143 loans totaling $43.9 million were TDRs.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	Included in this total were 122 TDRs to 120 borrowers totaling $26.0 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P78_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P79_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P79_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P79_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P79_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess potential weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P81_S1	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P81_S2	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P81_S3	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P81_S4	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as substandard or doubtful, the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P82_S2	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2015 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described previously.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	At December 31, 2015 , $77.8 million of loans were classified as substandard, which consisted of $20.7 million in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, $38.7 million in commercial loans, $12.0 million in residential loans, $2.4 million in construction loans and $4.1 million in consumer loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P86_S2	At that same date, loans classified as doubtful totaled $8,000 , which consisted of one commercial loan.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans decreased $18.8 million to $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 , from $20.0 million at December 31, 2014 .

1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S11	Non-performing construction loans consisted of a single loan to a health and fitness club, which combined with four non-performing commercial loans comprises a $9.2 million loan relationship with this borrower.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S12	This non-performing construction loan is presently in default.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S13	There were no non-performing construction loans at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S14	Non-performing residential mortgage loans decreased $5.2 million to $12.0 million at December 31, 2015 , from $17.2 million at December 31, 2014 .

1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S16	At December 31, 2015 , the Company held $10.5 million of foreclosed assets, compared with $5.1 million at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S17	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2015 are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P90_S18	Foreclosed assets consisted of $5.2 million of residential properties, $5.1 million of commercial real estate, and $274,000 of marine vessels at December 31, 2015 .

1178970_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 was not material.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P92_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P92_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S7	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S8	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P95_S9	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P96_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P96_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P96_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period; these factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	The most recent periodic review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors was completed in the third quarter of 2015 using historical loss data through June 30, 2015 and was applied effective September 30, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period; qualitative adjustments are recalibrated at least annually and evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	The range of adjustments to historical loss rates applicable to qualitative factors were updated in the third quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the general allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S2	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S3	As a result of this process, management may establish an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S4	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses accounts for the inherent impression of the overall loss estimation process, including the periodic updating of appraisals, commercial loan risk ratings, and economic uncertainty that may not be fully captured in the Bank's loss history or the qualitative factors.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S5	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S6	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S7	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S8	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S9	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S10	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P101_S11	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P103_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P103_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P103_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P106_S3	Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P106_S4	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P107_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P109_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P109_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P109_S2	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P109_S3	The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P110_S9	At December 31, 2015 , the Bank held $3.7 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.

1178970_16_ITEM1_P146_S1	At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P146_S2	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P146_S3	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P147_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P148_S0	Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P148_S1	These capital requirements are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and were effective January 1, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P149_S0	In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P149_S1	Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S0	Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S1	Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S2	Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S3	Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S4	Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P150_S5	Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P151_S0	Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P151_S1	In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P151_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P151_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P151_S4	The following table shows the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2015 :
1178970_16_ITEM1_P152_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P152_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P152_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P153_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P153_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P153_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P154_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P155_S0	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P155_S1	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P155_S2	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P155_S3	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P155_S4	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S2	As a member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLBNY stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P156_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , dividends paid by the FHLBNY to the Bank totaled $3.1 million.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P157_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P158_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P158_S1	An institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P158_S2	Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P159_S0	The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P160_S0	No institution may pay a dividend if in default of its federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P161_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P161_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P161_S2	On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that established a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P161_S3	The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P162_S0	The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P162_S1	Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank s deposit insurance.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P163_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P163_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P163_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P164_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P165_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P165_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P166_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P167_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P167_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P167_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P168_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P168_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P169_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P169_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P169_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P170_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P171_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P171_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P171_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P171_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P172_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P173_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P173_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of December 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P173_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P173_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P174_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P174_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P175_S0	The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P175_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P175_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P175_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P176_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P176_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P176_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P176_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P177_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P178_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P179_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P179_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P180_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P181_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P181_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P181_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P181_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P182_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P182_S1	The previously discussed final rule that increased capital requirements effective January 1, 2015 adjusted the prompt action categories as reflected above.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P183_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P184_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for, comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P184_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P184_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P186_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities owed to a savings bank by its directors and executive officers and by corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P186_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S1	The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $15.2 million and up to $110.2 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $110.2 million.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S2	The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P187_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P188_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P189_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P189_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P189_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have targeted various aspects of internet banking, including the security and systems.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P189_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s Internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P190_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P190_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P190_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P191_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P192_S0	The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P192_S1	Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies (with greater than $1 billion of assets) as of January 1, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P192_S2	As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P192_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company s regulatory capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P193_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P193_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P193_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P194_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P194_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P194_S2	Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P195_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P195_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P196_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P196_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P197_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P198_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P199_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P199_S1	Financial holding companies may engage in a broader array of activities including insurance and investment banking.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P200_S0	The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014 which was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve Board on March 5, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P200_S1	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if at the time of the election and on a continuing basis:
1178970_16_ITEM1_P201_S0	each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a Satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P202_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P202_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P203_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P203_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P203_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P204_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P205_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P205_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P206_S0	Investment Adviser Regulation Each of Beacon Investment Advisory Services, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC are investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P206_S1	As such, they are required to make certain filings with and are subject to periodic examination by, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P207_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P207_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P207_S2	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P207_S3	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P207_S4	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P208_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P208_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P209_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2015 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P210_S6	At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $20.1 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P211_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_16_ITEM1_P211_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P211_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P212_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P212_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P213_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P213_S1	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $3,000,000 of Federal Net Operating Losses ("NOLs").
1178970_16_ITEM1_P213_S2	These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P214_S0	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P215_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P215_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax ( CBT ) at 9% of apportioned taxable income.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S2	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S3	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S4	As a result of the acquisition of Team Capital in 2014, the Bank is now subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax.
1178970_16_ITEM1_P216_S5	Mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5 percent on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Until recently, the Federal Reserve Board had maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If the Federal Reserve Board s recent action to start increasing short-term rates does not result in an increase in long-term rates, we may experience a flattening or inverted yield curve that would negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Further, if rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than any changes in interest rates earned on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S4	Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest margin could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S5	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 2.5% or $6.2 million .
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S8	At December 31, 2015 , our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $964.5 million .
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that such prepayments cannot be reinvested at a profitable spread in excess of our funding costs.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	Increases in interest rates can result in reduced prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities, as borrowers retain existing loans to maintain lower borrowing costs.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are subject to liquidity risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost within acceptable risk tolerances.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan originations and commitments, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments on loans; the sale, maturity and prepayment of investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S4	Recent regulations implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have made retail deposits in transaction accounts more attractive to banks with assets greater than $50 billion, which pressures will likely continue to increase the competition we face to retain these deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S5	Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P5_S6	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews and credit risk ratings, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Our emphasis on the diversification of our loan portfolio through the origination of commercial mortgage loans, commercial loans, and construction loans has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	In the event we were to further increase the amount of such types of loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make additional or increased provisions for loans losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S6	In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P6_S7	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	A downturn in the housing sector and related markets may adversely affect our business and financial results.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Our lending business and investments in mortgage-backed securities are tied in large part to the housing market.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Lower home prices, a heightened level of foreclosures, or a protracted foreclosure process would adversely impact the credit performance of real estate related loans and collateral values.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S3	These conditions could potentially cause a reduction in loan demand, and increases in our non-performing assets, net charge-offs and provisions for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Such negative economic conditions could adversely impact our prospects for growth, asset and goodwill valuations, and could result in a decrease in our interest income and a material increase in our provision for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S5	A general economic slowdown or uncertainty that produces either reduced returns or excessive market volatility could adversely impact our wealth management fee income.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S6	A general economic slowdown could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P7_S7	Furthermore, conditions that produce extended market volatility could affect our ability to provide our customers with an adequate return, thereby causing them to seek more stable investment opportunities with alternative wealth advisors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	A significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, multi-family loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S5	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S6	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S7	Our success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, and with the acquisition of Team Capital Bank in 2014, eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S8	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers mostly located in our primary markets.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S9	Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S10	Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P8_S11	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, depressed real estate values and real estate sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P9_S3	Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processers, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S3	Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S4	Our customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S5	Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P11_S6	We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers, who are used extensively in support of our operations, to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, the occurrence of systems failures and disruptions, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S5	While we maintain a risk management program that is designed to minimize risk, we could suffer losses, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S6	We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S7	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S8	As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S9	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S10	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to stockholders, the classification of our assets, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and our management of risks posed by our reliance on third party vendors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S11	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P13_S12	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Financial reform legislation could substantially increase our compliance burden and costs and necessitate changes in the conduct of our business.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act is having a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over time.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear and may not be known for many years.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In particular, the following provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, among others, are impacting our operations and activities, both currently and prospectively: imposition of comprehensive, new consumer protection requirements, which could substantially increase our compliance burden and potentially expose us to new liabilities; application of regulatory capital requirements to the Company; and changes in methodologies for calculating deposit insurance premiums and increases in required deposit insurance fund reserve levels, which could increase our deposit insurance expense.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to additional requirements imposed by the Dodd Frank Act and its implementing regulations such as the imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, enhanced risk management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S5	As we approach $10 billion in assets, we will be required to incur additional costs to address these imposed requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Further, we may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S2	The short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S3	The federal banking agencies have adopted proposals that have substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S4	The amendments implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S5	The new rules apply regulatory capital requirements to both the Bank and the consolidated Company.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S6	The amended rules included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S7	The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S8	The amended rules also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S9	The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S10	An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S11	These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S12	The Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will result in generally higher regulatory capital standards.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S13	The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Bank and the consolidated Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S14	Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S15	Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P18_S16	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S6	Acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P19_S7	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, cause disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	At December 31, 2015 , goodwill totaling $411.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	A company has the option to qualitatively determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before proceeding with a two step quantitative impairment analysis.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If a company concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the quantitative impairment analysis and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied value.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Fair value may be determined using market prices, comparison to similar assets, market multiples, discounted cash flow analysis and other factors.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Estimated cash flows may extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to determine over an extended time frame.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_16_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Property At December 31, 2015 , the Bank conducted business through 87 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The aggregate net book value of premises and equipment was $ 89.0 million at December 31, 2015 .

1178970_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol PFS.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	Trading in the Company s common stock commenced on January 16, 2003.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of February 1, 2016, there were 83,209,293 shares of the Company s common stock issued and 65,794,731 shares outstanding, and approximately 5,270 stockholders of record.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P0_S3	The table below shows the high and low closing prices reported on the NYSE for the Company s common stock, as well as the cash dividends paid per common share during the periods indicated.

1178970_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company s Board of Directors intends to review the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, subject to financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, industry standards, economic conditions, regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and other relevant factors.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P1_S3	If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or immediately preceding year.
1178970_16_ITEM5_P1_S4	In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

1178970_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	General On January 15, 2003, the Company became the holding company for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating 87 full-service branches throughout northern and central New Jersey, as well as Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2015 , these commercial loan types accounted for 72.1% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 27.9% .
1178970_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to focus on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial lending relationships.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	Core deposits, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P4_S1	At December 31, 2015 , core deposits were 87.5% of total deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P5_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, loan level swap fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	Acquisitions On April 1, 2015, Beacon Trust Company ("Beacon"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Provident Bank, completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of The MDE Group, Inc. and the equity interests of Acertus Capital Management, LLC (together "MDE"), both Morristown, New Jersey-based registered investment advisory firms that manage assets for affluent and high net-worth clients.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	MDE was acquired with both cash and contingent consideration.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company recognized goodwill of $18.3 million and a customer relationship intangible of $7.0 million related to the acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Company recognized a contingent consideration liability at its fair value of $338,000.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S4	The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay additional cash consideration to MDE s former stakeholders four years after the closing of the acquisition if certain revenue targets are met.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S5	The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P7_S6	The acquisition agreement limits the total payment to a maximum of $12.5 million, to be determined based on actual future results.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	On October 31, 2014, Beacon acquired the fiduciary account relationships of Suffolk County National Bank, a subsidiary of Suffolk Bancorp, in Suffolk County, New York.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P8_S1	On May 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Team Capital Bank ("Team Capital"), which after purchase accounting adjustments added $964.0 million to total assets, $631.2 million to loans, and $769.9 million to deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P8_S2	Total consideration paid for Team Capital was $115.1 million: $31.6 million in cash and 4.9 million shares of common stock valued at $83.5 million on the acquisition date.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P8_S3	Team Capital was merged with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank as of the close of business on the date of acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P8_S4	The merger added twelve branches to The Provident Bank branch network, with five branches in Pennsylvania and seven in New Jersey.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P9_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P9_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P9_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P11_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party, and periodically by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P12_S8	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk rating.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	Quantitative loss factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S3	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S4	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S5	Qualitative adjustments are evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P13_S6	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a general decline in the economy, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of elevated unemployment, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P14_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Management qualitatively determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	The guidance provides certain factors an entity should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P26_S3	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, such that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) was warranted.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, Management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	If either exists, the decline in value is considered other-than-temporary.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	In its evaluations, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge on securities for 2015 and 2014, while in 2013, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $434,000.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carry-back years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company did not require a valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1178970_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P34_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P34_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 Total assets increased $388.3 million , or 4.6% , to $8.91 billion at December 31, 2015 , from $8.52 billion at December 31, 2014 , primarily due to a $452.2 million increase in total loans and a $21.9 million increase in intangible assets, partially offset by a $97.3 million decrease in total investments.

1178970_16_ITEM7_P41_S1	The allowance for loan losses decreased $310,000 to $61.4 million at December 31, 2015 , as a result of net charge-offs of $4.7 million , partially offset by provisions for loan losses of $4.4 million during 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM7_P41_S2	The reduction in the allowance for loan losses was a function of an improvement in the weighted average risk rating of the loan portfolio and a decline in non-performing loans.
1178970_16_ITEM7_P41_S3	Total non-performing loans at December 31, 2015 were $44.5 million, or 0.68% of total loans, compared with $53.9 million, or 0.88% of total loans at December 31, 2014 .

1178970_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The guidelines of the Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets and liabilities, earnings and capital.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal funds rate or LIBOR.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Investment securities purchases generally have maturities of five years or less, and mortgage-backed securities have weighted average lives initially between three and five years.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Asset/Liability Committee meets on at least a monthly basis to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income and economic value of equity.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Members of the Asset/Liability Committee include the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other senior officers from the Bank s finance, lending, credit, retail banking and corporate operations departments.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core-funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 12.5% at December 31, 2015 , compared to 14.3% at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts are generally short-term.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P4_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , 67.5% of all certificates of deposit had maturities of one year or less compared to 68.8% at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is reliant upon remaining competitively priced within the marketplace.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB of New York during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P5_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2015 , in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 2.5% , or $6.2 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 2.3% , or $5.7 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2015 , in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 10.3% , or $136.8 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 1.9% , or $24.6 million increase in the present value of equity.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P12_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P12_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM7A_P12_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P11_S2	Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform with current year classifications.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P13_S1	Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform with current year classifications.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P14_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P16_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P16_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P17_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P17_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P18_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P20_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P20_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLBNY ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLBNY at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P23_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P24_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	Purchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI ) loans, are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P26_S1	PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, with no allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P26_S2	The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value of the PCI loans at acquisition represents the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P26_S3	Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition represent the non-accretable discount and are not recognized as a yield adjustment or a valuation allowance.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P26_S4	Reclassifications of the non-accretable to accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to an increase in expected cash flows of the loans and results in an increase in interest income on a prospective basis.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P27_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P28_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P28_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P28_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P29_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P29_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P31_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings, and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P31_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P31_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P32_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30 th .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S5	As permitted by GAAP, the Company prepares a qualitative assessment in determining whether goodwill may be impaired.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S6	The factors considered in the assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S7	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P35_S8	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis was warranted.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and MDE, and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years and 10.4 years, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P41_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter and the amount of shares allocated during the quarter.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Bank has an Equity Plan designed to provide competitive compensation for demonstrated performance and to align the interests of participants directly to increases in shareholder value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Equity Plan provides for performance-vesting grants as well as time-vesting grants.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P42_S2	Time-vesting stock awards, stock options and performance vesting stock awards that are based on a performance condition, such as return on average assets are valued on the closing stock price on the date of grant.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P42_S3	Performance vesting stock awards and options that are based on a market condition, such as Total Shareholder Return, would be valued using a generally accepted statistical technique to simulate future stock prices for Provident and the components of the Peer Group which Provident would be measured against.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Expense related to time vesting stock awards and stock options is based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant and on the fair value of the stock options on the date of the grant, respectively, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Performance vesting stock awards and stock options are either dependent upon a market condition or a performance condition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	A market condition performance metric is tied to a stock price, either on an absolute basis, or a relative basis against peers, while a performance-condition is based on internal operations, such as earnings per share.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S2	The expense related to a market condition performance-vesting stock award or stock option requires an initial Monte Carlo simulation to determine grant date fair value, which will be recognized as a compensation expense regardless of actual payout, assuming that the executive is still employed at the end of the requisite service period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S3	If pre-vesting termination (forfeiture) occurs, then any expense recognized to date can be reversed.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S4	The grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the performance period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P44_S5	The expense related to a performance condition stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted periodically based upon the number of awards or options expected to be earned, recognized over the performance period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P45_S3	These accounts will be liquidated as shares are distributed from the DDFP in accordance with the plan document.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P45_S4	At December 31, 2015 , there were 372,817 shares held by the DDFP.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Bank maintains a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain executives who are prevented from receiving the full benefits contemplated by the 401(k) Plan s and the ESOP s benefit formulas under tax law limits for tax-qualified plans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Bank provides post-retirement health care and life insurance plans to certain of its employees.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	The life insurance coverage is noncontributory to the participant.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P47_S2	Participants contribute to the cost of medical coverage based on the employee s length of service with the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P47_S3	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	On December 31, 2002, the Bank eliminated postretirement healthcare benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S3	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S4	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S5	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P51_S6	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analyses using observable market-based inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	Other comprehensive income includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Segment Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing traditional banking and other financial services to its customers.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	Shares issued and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	A modified retrospective approach must be applied for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S4	The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S5	The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S6	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S7	Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S8	The Company intends to adopt the accounting standard during the first quarter of 2018, as required, and is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S9	The amendments in this update apply to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S10	In these cases, the acquirer must record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S11	The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P61_S12	The Company s adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-14, Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors: Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	The amendments in this update affect creditors that hold government guaranteed mortgage loans, including those guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	The amendments in this update require that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure if the following conditions are met: (i) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; (ii) at the time of foreclosure, the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate property to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee, and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim; and (iii) at the time of foreclosure, any amount of the claim that is determined on the basis of the fair value of the real estate is fixed.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S3	Upon foreclosure, the separate other receivable should be measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) expected to be recovered from the guarantor.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S4	The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P62_S5	The Company's adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period," which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	The amendments can be applied prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented and to all new or modified awards thereafter.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S3	The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S4	Also in June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-11, "Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures" which aligns the accounting for repurchase to maturity transactions and repurchase agreements executed as a repurchase financing with the accounting for other typical repurchase agreements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S5	Going forward, these transactions would all be accounted for as secured borrowings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S6	This update is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after December 15, 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S7	In addition the disclosure of certain transactions accounted for as a sale is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings is required for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods beginning after March 15, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P63_S8	The Company's adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	On January 15, 2003, the Bank completed its plan of conversion, and the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company sold 59.6 million shares of common stock (par value $0.01 per share) at $10.00 per share.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	The Company received net proceeds in the amount of $567.2 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P64_S3	In connection with the Bank s commitment to its community, the plan of conversion provided for the establishment of a charitable foundation.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P64_S4	Provident donated $4.8 million in cash and 1.92 million of authorized but unissued shares of common stock to the foundation, which amounted to $24.0 million in aggregate.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company recognized an expense, net of income tax benefit, equal to the cash and fair value of the stock during 2003.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Conversion costs were deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the shares sold in the offering.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S2	Upon completion of the plan of conversion, a liquidation account was established in an amount equal to the total equity of the Bank as of the latest practicable date prior to the conversion.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S3	The liquidation account was established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the Bank to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders as defined in the Plan, who continue to maintain deposits in the Bank after the conversion.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S4	In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event, each eligible account holder and supplemental eligible account holder would receive a liquidation distribution, prior to any payment to the holder of the Bank s common stock.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S5	This distribution would be based upon each eligible account holder s and supplemental eligible account holder s proportionate share of the then total remaining qualifying deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P65_S6	At December 31, 2015 , the liquidation account, which is an off-balance sheet memorandum account, amounted to $13.9 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	On April 1, 2015, Beacon Trust Company ("Beacon"), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Provident Bank, completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of The MDE Group, Inc. and the equity interests of Acertus Capital Management, LLC (together "MDE"), both Morristown, New Jersey-based registered investment advisory firms that manage assets for affluent and high net-worth clients.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	MDE was acquired with both cash and contingent consideration.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Company recognized goodwill of $18.3 million and a customer relationship intangible of $7.0 million related to the acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Company recognized a contingent consideration liability at its fair value of $338,000 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S4	The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay additional cash consideration to MDE s former stakeholders four years after the closing of the acquisition if certain revenue targets are met.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S5	The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P66_S6	The acquisition agreement limits the total payment to a maximum of $12.5 million , to be determined based on actual future results.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	On October 31, 2014, Beacon acquired the fiduciary account relationships of Suffolk County National Bank, a subsidiary of Suffolk Bancorp, in Suffolk County, New York.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	On May 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Team Capital Bank ("Team Capital"), which after purchase accounting adjustments added $964.0 million to total assets, $631.2 million to loans, and $769.9 million to deposits.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	Total consideration paid for Team Capital was $115.1 million : $31.6 million in cash and 4.9 million shares of common stock valued at $83.5 million on the acquisition date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	Team Capital was merged with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank as of the close of business on the date of acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S4	The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S5	Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, net of tax.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P67_S6	The excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition from Team Capital, net of cash consideration paid (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Upon the completion and filing of the Team Capital short-period tax return for the period ended May 30, 2014, a net operating loss carryback claim was filed with the Internal Revenue Service to reclaim taxes previously paid by Team Capital in the prior two years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	As a result of the claim process, the Company determined that the tax receivable established by Team Capital at the May 30, 2014 acquisition date was overstated by $543,000 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	In May 2015, the Company decreased the tax receivable recorded at the date of acquisition by $543,000 , along with a corresponding increase to goodwill.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	The purchase accounting for the Team Capital transaction is complete, and is reflected in both the table above and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The estimated fair values of the investment securities classified as available for sale were calculated utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Management reviewed the data and assumptions used by its third party provider in pricing the securities to ensure the highest level of significant inputs is derived from observable market data.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	These prices were validated against other pricing sources and broker-dealer indications.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S3	The acquired loan portfolio was valued based on current guidance which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S4	Level 3 inputs were utilized to value the portfolio and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and the incorporated assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P71_S5	In instances where reliable market information was not available, the Company used its own assumptions in an effort to determine reasonable fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	The three separate fair valuation methodologies used were: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value adjustment; and 3) specific credit fair value adjustment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	To prepare the interest rate fair value analysis, loans were grouped by characteristics such as loan type, term, collateral and rate.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Market rates for similar loans were obtained from various external data sources and reviewed by Company management for reasonableness.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	The average of these rates was used as the fair value interest rate a market participant would utilize.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	A present value approach was utilized to calculate the interest rate fair value adjustment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S4	The general credit fair value adjustment was calculated using a two part general credit fair value analysis: 1) expected lifetime losses; and 2) estimated fair value adjustment for qualitative factors.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S5	The expected lifetime losses were calculated using an average of historical losses of the Company, the acquired bank and peer banks.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P73_S6	The adjustment related to qualitative factors was impacted by general economic conditions and the risk related to lack of familiarity with the originator's underwriting process.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	To calculate the specific credit fair value adjustment, management reviewed the acquired loan portfolio for loans meeting the definition of an impaired loan with deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Loans meeting this definition were reviewed by comparing the contractual cash flows to expected collectible cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	The aggregate expected cash flows less the acquisition date fair value resulted in an accretable yield amount.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	The accretable yield amount will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Deposits and Core Deposit Premium Core deposit premium represents the value assigned to demand, interest checking, money market and savings accounts acquired as part of an acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	The core deposit premium value represents the future economic benefit, including the present value of future tax benefits, of the potential cost savings from acquiring core deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost alternative funding sources and was valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	Time deposits are not considered to be core deposits as they are assumed to have a low expected average life upon acquisition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	The fair value of time deposits represents the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted by market rates for similar time deposits and was valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	The fair value for borrowed funds was obtained from actual prepayment rates from the FHLB - Pittsburgh, a Level 2 input.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	These borrowings were redeemed after the acquisition date and the fair value adjustment was fully amortized in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	(3) Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks Included in cash on hand and due from banks at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $24,288,000 and $20,502,000 , respectively, representing reserves required by banking regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	(4) Investment Securities Held to Maturity Investment securities held to maturity at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

1178970_16_ITEM8_P79_S2	The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities held to maturity at December 31, 2015 by contractual maturity are shown below (in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment or early call privileges of the issuer.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Mortgage-backed securities totaling $1.6 million at amortized cost and $1.7 million at fair value are excluded from the table above as their expected lives are expected to be shorter than the contractual maturity date due to principal prepayments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	During 2015 , the Company recognized gains of $8,000 and no losses related to calls on certain securities in the held to maturity portfolio, with total proceeds from the calls totaling $26,973,000 .

1178970_16_ITEM8_P81_S5	The sales of these securities were in response to the credit deterioration of the issuers.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P81_S6	The following table represents the Company s disclosure on investment securities held to maturity with temporary impairment (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	Based on its detailed review of the securities portfolio, the Company believes that as of December 31, 2015 , securities with unrealized loss positions shown above do not represent impairments that are other-than-temporary.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P82_S1	The review of the portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment considered the percentage and length of time the fair value of an investment is below book value as well as general market conditions, changes in interest rates, credit risk, whether the Company has the intent to sell the securities and whether it is not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	The number of securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2015 totaled 99 , compared with 163 at December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	All temporarily impaired investment securities were investment grade at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	(5) Securities Available for Sale Securities available for sale at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	Securities available for sale having a carrying value of $614,824,000 and $585,928,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, are pledged to secure other borrowings and securities sold under repurchase agreements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	The amortized cost and fair value of securities available for sale at December 31, 2015 , by contractual maturity, are shown below (in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to prepayment or early call privileges of the issuer.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Mortgage-backed securities totaling $857.4 million at amortized cost and $863.9 million at fair value are excluded from the table above as their expected lives are expected to be shorter than the contractual maturity date due to principal prepayments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	Also excluded from the table above are equity securities of $ 397,000 at amortized cost and $ 519,000 at fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	During 2015 , proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale were $14,005,000 , resulting in gross gains of $643,000 and no gross losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P87_S3	Also, for the year ended December 31, 2015 , proceeds from calls on securities available for sale totaled $1,110,000 , with gross gains of $3,000 and no gross losses recognized.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P87_S4	For the 2014 period, proceeds from the sale of securities available for sale were $24,509,000 resulting in gross gains of $632,000 and gross losses of 404,000 losses.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Company estimates the loss projections for each non-agency mortgage-backed security by stressing the individual loans collateralizing the security and applying a range of expected default rates, loss severities, and prepayment speeds in conjunction with the underlying credit enhancement for each security.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) on debt securities for which a non-credit component of OTTI was recognized in other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	OTTI recognized in earnings after that date for credit-impaired debt securities is presented as an addition in two components, based upon whether the current period is the first time a debt security was credit-impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairment).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	Changes in the credit loss component of credit-impaired debt securities were as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company did not incur a net other-than-temporary impairment charge on securities available for sale.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Company previously incurred cumulative credit losses of $1.7 million on these securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P90_S3	Prior to these charges, any impairment was considered temporary and was recorded as an unrealized loss on securities available for sale and reflected as a reduction of equity, net of tax, through accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The following table represents the Company s disclosure on securities available for sale with temporary impairment (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	The Company does not have the intent to sell securities in a temporary loss position at December 31, 2015 , nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P92_S4	The number of securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2015 totaled 64 , compared with 43 at December 31, 2014 .

1178970_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	(6) Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans receivable at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized over the lives of the loans as an adjustment to yield.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P94_S1	Required reductions due to loan prepayments are charged against interest income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P94_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , $ $1,100,000 , $694,000 and $1,286,000 , respectively, decreased interest income as a result of prepayments and normal amortization.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P94_S3	The following table summarizes the aging of loans receivable by portfolio segment and class of loans, excluding PCI loans (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $44.4 million and $53.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S2	At December 31, 2015 , there was one commercial loan for $ 165,000 which was ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S3	This loan was past maturity and well secured at December 31, 2015, which subsequent to the end of the year was refinanced by the Company.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S4	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest in 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S5	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1,200,000 , $1,877,000 and $1,913,000 , for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P95_S6	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was not material for the periods presented.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P96_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P96_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analysis of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	A third-party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses as a result of this process.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	At December 31, 2015 , there were 148 impaired loans totaling $50.9 million , of which 143 loans totaling $43.9 million were TDRs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	Included in this total were 122 TDRs related to 120 borrowers totaling $26.0 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2015 .

1178970_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The allowance for loan losses is summarized by portfolio segment and impairment classification, excluding PCI loans as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	(1) For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company enhanced its allowance for loan losses process and allocated the previously unallocated allowance using both qualitative and quantitative factors.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P105_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	The following tables present the number of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and their balances immediately prior to the modification date and post-modification as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as previously discussed.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S1	Estimated collateral values of collateral dependent impaired loans modified during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 exceeded the carrying amounts of such loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S2	As a result, there were $465,000 of charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S3	There were no charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S4	The allowance for loan losses associated with the TDRs presented in the preceding tables totaled $99,000 and $419,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively and were included in the allowance for loan losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P108_S5	The TDRs presented in the preceding tables had a weighted average modified interest rate of approximately 5.25% and 4.58% , compared to a yield of 5.71% and 5.69% prior to modification for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	The following table presents loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months from December 31, 2015 and 2014 , and for which there was a payment default (90 days or more past due) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1178970_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	TDRs that subsequently default are considered collateral dependent impaired loans and are evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less expected selling costs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	PCI loans are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	As part of the Team Capital acquisition, $5.2 million of the loans purchased at May 30, 2014 were determined to be PCI loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	PCI loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, with no related allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The following table presents information regarding the estimates of the contractually required payments, the cash flows expected to be collected and the estimated fair value of the PCI loans acquired from Team Capital at May 30, 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	PCI loans totaled $3.4 million at December 31, 2015 , compared to $4.5 million at December 31, 2014 and $5.2 million at acquisition from Team Capital on May 30, 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	The $1.1 million and $1.8 million decrease from December 31, 2014 and the May 31, 2014 acquisition date was largely due to the full repayment and greater than projected cash flows on certain PCI loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	This resulted in a $230,000 and a $348,000 increase in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to the acceleration of accretable and non-accretable discount on these loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P113_S3	The following table summarizes the changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	The activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 is as follows (in thousands):

1178970_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	At December 31, 2014 , impaired loans consisted of 147 residential, commercial and commercial mortgage loans totaling $85,395,000 , of which 24 loans totaling $30,619,000 were included in nonaccrual loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	Specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses attributable to impaired loans totaled $2,271,000 and $7,127,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for loan losses totaled $33,376,000 and $18,346,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P117_S4	The average balances of impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $51,225,000 and $87,869,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $866,403,000 and $908,581,000 , at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $287,942,000 and $300,029,000 , at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively) exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P121_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P122_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P122_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	Collateral and/or guarantees are required for virtually all loans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P123_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Loans receivable by credit quality risk rating indicator, excluding PCI loans are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_16_ITEM8_P140_S2	Based on the measurement date of December 31, 2015 , no contributions will be made to the pension plan in 2016 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	In an effort to lower and reduce the volatility of its future pension costs, the Company offered a lump sum pension distribution option to its terminated vested employees in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	paid $4.3 million to those employees that elected to receive lump sum pension distributions and the Company realized an associated charge of $1.3 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	This charge was a pro rata share of the unrecognized losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	In addition to pension benefits, certain healthcare and life insurance benefits are currently made available to certain of the Bank s retired employees.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P145_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the introduction of the updated mortality data resulted in an actuarial loss of $1.5 million and $3.0 million for the pension and post-retirement plans, respectively, and was reflected in other comprehensive income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P145_S2	The prepaid pension benefits of $ 13.2 million and the unfunded post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits of $ 25.7 million at December 31, 2015 are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated statement of financial condition.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Company provides its actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring the benefit obligation.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period-end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S2	A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S3	The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow-yield curve model specific to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S4	The Company compares this rate to certain market indices, such as long-term treasury bonds, or the Citigroup pension liability indices, for reasonableness.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P148_S5	A discount rate of 4.50% was selected for the December 31, 2015 measurement date.

1178970_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	The expected return on pension plan assets is also impacted by the target allocation of assets, which is based on the Company s goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P152_S2	Management strives to have pension plan assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have a significant detrimental impact on the entire portfolio.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P152_S3	The target allocation of assets and acceptable ranges around the targets are as follows:

1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S1	The ESOP purchased 4,769,464 shares of the Company s common stock at an average price of $17.09 per share with the proceeds of a loan from the Company to the ESOP.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S2	The outstanding loan principal at December 31, 2015 , was $49.9 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S3	Shares of the Company s common stock pledged as collateral for the loan are released from the pledge for allocation to participants as loan payments are made.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S4	For the ESOP years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014 , 209,631 shares and 201,512 shares were released, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S5	Unallocated ESOP shares held in suspense totaled 2,442,414 at December 31, 2015 , and had a fair value of $49.2 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P160_S6	ESOP compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $2,997,000 , $2,654,000 and $2,559,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	Effective January 1, 2004, the Bank established a deferred compensation plan for executive management and key employees of the Bank, known as The Provident Bank Non-Qualified Supplemental Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the Supplemental ESOP ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	The Supplemental ESOP was amended and restated as the Non-Qualified Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan (the Supplemental DC Plan ), effective January 1, 2010.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	The Supplemental DC Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides additional benefits to certain executives whose benefits under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP are limited by tax law limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S3	The Supplemental DC Plan requires a contribution by the Bank for each participant who also participates in the 401(k) Plan and ESOP equal to the amount that would have been contributed under the terms of the of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP but for the tax law limitations, less the amount actually contributed under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S4	The Supplemental DC Plan provides for a phantom stock allocation for qualified contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified ESOP and for matching contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified 401(k) Plan due to tax law limitations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S5	Under the Supplemental 401(k) provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $11,500 , $10,500 and $7,000 , respectively, and included the matching contributions plus interest credited at an annual rate equal to the ten-year bond-equivalent yield on U.S. Treasury securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S6	Under the Supplemental ESOP provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $54,000 , $48,000 and $45,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P161_S7	The phantom equity is treated as equity awards (expensed at the time of allocation) and not liability awards which would require periodic adjustment to market, as participants do not have an option to take their distribution in cash.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan Upon stockholders approval of the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan on April 4, 2014, shares available for stock awards and stock options under the 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan were reserved for issuance under the new Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	No additional grants of stock awards and stock options will be made under the 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	The new plan authorized the issuance of up to 3,686,510 shares of Company common stock with no more than 2,100,000 shares permitted to be issued as stock awards.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P162_S3	Shares previously awarded under the 2008 plans that are subsequently forfeited or expire may also be issued under the new plan.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	Stock Awards As a general rule, restricted stock grants are held in escrow for the benefit of the award recipient until vested.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	Awards outstanding generally vest in three or five annual installments, commencing one year from the date of the award.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P163_S2	Additionally, certain awards are two and three -year performance vesting awards, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P163_S3	Expense attributable to stock awards amounted to $4,625,000 , $6,359,000 and $4,869,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P163_S4	A summary status of the granted but unvested stock awards as of December 31, and changes during the year, is presented below:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , unrecognized compensation cost relating to unvested restricted stock totaled $1.8 million .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	This amount will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 2.1 years.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	Each stock option granted entitles the holder to purchase one share of the Company s common stock at an exercise price not less than the fair value of a share of the Company s common stock at the date of grant.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P165_S1	Options generally vest over a five -year period from the date of grant and expire no later than 10 years following the grant date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P165_S2	Additionally, certain options are three -year performance vesting options, which may or may not vest depending upon the attainment of certain corporate financial targets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P165_S3	A summary of the status of the granted but unexercised stock options as of December 31, and changes during the year is presented below:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	The total fair value of options vesting during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $274,000 , $438,000 and $696,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	Compensation expense of approximately $130,000 , $96,000 and $21,000 is projected for 2016 , 2017 and 2018 , respectively, on stock options outstanding at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P166_S2	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2015 :
1178970_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	The stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable at December 31, 2015 have an aggregate intrinsic value of $5,720,000 and $4,703,000 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	The expense related to stock options is based on the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the options.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	Compensation expense related to the Company s stock option plan totaled $272,000 , $298,000 and $297,000 for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	The estimated fair values were determined on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	The fair value of the Company stock option awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock option.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a term approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P170_S2	The expected volatility computation is based on historical volatility over a period approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P170_S3	The dividend yield is based on the annual dividend payment per share, divided by the grant date stock price.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	The expected option term is a function of the option life and the vesting period.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	The fair value of the option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2015 , 2014 and 2013 was $2.52 , $1.64 and $3.49 per option, respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	(12) Income Taxes The current and deferred amounts of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	The Company recorded, in accumulated other comprehensive income, a deferred tax expense (benefit) of $866,000 , ($3,800,000) and $4,968,000 in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, related to the amortization of post-retirement benefit obligations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	A reconciliation between the amount of reported total income tax expense and the amount computed by multiplying the applicable statutory income tax rate is as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	The net deferred tax asset is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	The 2014 deferred tax expense does not equal the change in net deferred tax assets as a result of deferred taxes recorded in connection with the Team Capital acquisition in the amount of $486,000 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	Retained earnings at December 31, 2015 includes approximately $51,800,000 for which no provision for income tax has been made.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S2	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include the failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to stockholders.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S3	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had an unrecognized tax liability of $20,802,880 with respect to this reserve.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S4	At December 31, 2014, the Company had a valuation allowance of $242,000 related to approximately $648,000 of capital loss carryforwards.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P179_S5	At December 31, 2015 , the Company did not require a valuation allowance as the statute of limitation on these capital loss carryforwards expired.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	As a result of the Beacon acquisition in 2011, the Company acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P180_S1	There are approximately $3,000,000 of NOL carryforwards available to offset future taxable income as of December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P180_S2	If not utilized, these carryforwards will expire in 2030.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P180_S3	Also, the Company's New Jersey NOL carryforwards in the amount of $1,000,000 which are scheduled to expire in 2033 and Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards in the amount of $1,000,000 , which are set to expire in 2016.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	The federal NOLs are subject to a combined annual Code Section 382 limitation in the amount of approximately $900,000 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	Management has determined that it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset based upon the nature and timing of the items listed above.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P182_S1	In order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P182_S2	Management has projected that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net deferred tax asset; however, there can be no assurance that such levels of taxable income will be generated.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company s policy is to report interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and each entity files a separate state income tax return.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P184_S1	The Company's federal income tax returns are open for examination from 2012 and the state income tax returns are open for examination from 2011.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	(13) Lease Commitments The approximate future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of taxes and other related charges, for all significant non-cancellable operating leases at December 31, 2015 , are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	Rental expense was $8,889,000 , $8,056,000 and $6,850,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P187_S1	In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial position of the Company will not be materially affected by the outcome of such commitments or contingent liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans secured by real estate located in New Jersey.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in local real estate market conditions.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	(15) Regulatory Capital Requirements FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P189_S1	Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2015 , the Bank is required to maintain: (1) a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4.0% ; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5% ; (3) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0% ; and (4) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0% .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P189_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P189_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	Under its prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P190_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P191_S1	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has: a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% ; a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% ; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00% ; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00% .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P192_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P192_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P192_S3	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P192_S4	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P193_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P193_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P194_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P194_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	The following table shows the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	The following table shows the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , compared to the FDIC minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P197_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P197_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P197_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P198_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P198_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P200_S2	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P203_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P203_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P204_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S2	Currently, none of the Company s derivatives are designated in qualifying hedging relationships.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S3	The existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S4	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S5	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S6	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S7	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with FHLBNY borrowings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S8	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P205_S9	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs, which are considered Level 2 inputs.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P207_S1	Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P207_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P207_S3	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case-by-case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, as well as adjustments for estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P207_S4	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs to sell of up to 6% .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P208_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P210_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P214_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P217_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P218_S6	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	The carrying value of FHLBNY stock was its cost.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P219_S1	The fair value of FHLBNY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P219_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P220_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P220_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P220_S3	The fair value of performing loans was estimated using a combination of techniques, including a discounted cash flow model that utilizes a discount rate that reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P220_S4	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans was based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its non-performing loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S3	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, was equal to the amount payable on demand and classified as Level 1.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S4	The estimated fair value of certificates of deposit was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P221_S5	The discount rate was estimated using the Company s current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its certificates of deposit portfolio as Level 2.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P222_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and was classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P222_S2	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P223_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P223_S2	Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P223_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P224_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P224_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P225_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	The following tables present the Company s financial instruments at their carrying and fair values as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P226_S1	Fair values are presented by level within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	The following tables are a summary of certain quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the outstanding shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	Anti-dilutive stock options and awards totaling 469,018 shares, 988,931 shares and 659,531 shares at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, were excluded from the earnings per share calculations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	(20) Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income The following table presents the components of other comprehensive (loss) income both gross and net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	The following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	The following table summarizes the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):
1178970_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	(1) This item is included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P234_S1	The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P234_S2	The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P234_S3	Derivatives not designated in qualifying hedging relationships are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain qualifying commercial borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P235_S1	Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P235_S2	As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P235_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 , the Company had 23 and 9 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $391.4 million and $94.9 million related to this program.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	Cash flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P236_S2	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P237_S1	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P237_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P238_S1	The Company implemented this program during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P238_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company s did not record any hedge ineffectiveness.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P238_S3	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P238_S4	During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $297,000 will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had one outstanding interest rate derivative with a notional amount of $40 million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):

1178970_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	The tables below present the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).
1178970_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	Derivatives not designated as a hedging instruments:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	Derivatives designated as a hedging instruments:
1178970_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P246_S1	The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well / adequate capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P246_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest, was $6.8 million.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P246_S3	The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral of $7.8 million against its obligations under these agreements.
1178970_16_ITEM8_P246_S4	If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2015 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s Principal Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Principal Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2015 .
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of Provident Financial Services, Inc. (the Company ) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( COSO ) (2013).
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	Based on the assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2015 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1178970_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 .

1178970_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits has come from several commercial banks and savings banks in its market area.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Certain of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P18_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund and investment advisory industries and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Generally, these loans have maturities of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	For loans greater than $5.0 million originated with maturities in excess of 7 years, the Bank generally requires loan-level interest rate swaps for qualified borrowers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Bank has historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects, including residential for rent projects that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	In most cases, for the single family and condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 64.4% were fixed-rate and 35.6% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P30_S4	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2.75%, adjusting annually after its first re-set period, with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S9	All of the loans sold in 2016 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P31_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $25.0 million.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $9.0 million for the past five years.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P36_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P36_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P37_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	Among the reasons for the Bank s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S5	The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P38_S6	If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Generally, for commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $1.0 million and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank requires environmental professionals to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S1	In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Bank requires a full independent appraisal for commercial real estate properties.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S2	The appraiser must be selected from the Bank s approved list, or otherwise approved by the Chief Credit Officer in instances such as out-of-state or special use property.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S3	The Bank also employs an independent review appraiser to ensure that the appraisal meets the Bank s standards.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S4	Financial statements are also required annually for review.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P39_S5	The Bank s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $2.5 million be completed at least every 18 months, or more frequently when warranted.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Bank s largest commercial mortgage loan as of December 31, 2016 was a $40.0 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on eight office buildings and five industrial/flex buildings located throughout Middlesex and Somerset counties in New Jersey.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	The Bank considers multi-family lending a component of the commercial real estate lending portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	The underwriting standards and procedures that are used to underwrite commercial real estate loans are used to underwrite multi-family loans, except the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property, the debt-service coverage should be a minimum of 1.15 times and an amortization period of up to 30 years may be used.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	The Bank s largest multi-family loan as of December 31, 2016 was a $41.0 million loan secured by a first leasehold mortgage lien on a newly renovated 129-unit, six story class A luxury rental apartment building with 12,000 square feet of office/retail space located in Morristown, New Jersey.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P42_S1	The project sponsor is one of the largest privately-held real estate owner/developers in the United States, and has extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of multi-family projects.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	The Bank employs professional engineering firms to assist in the review of construction cost estimates and make site inspections to determine if the work has been completed prior to the advance of funds for the project.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate or multi-family lending.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	On commercial construction projects that the developer maintains for rental, the Bank typically holds back funds for tenant improvements until a lease is executed.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	For single family and condominium financing, the Bank generally requires payment for the release of a unit that exceeds the amount of the loan advance attributable to such unit.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Bank s largest construction loan at December 31, 2016 was a $28.0 million share of a $78.0 million syndicated construction loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a class "A" 10 story apartment building containing 295 multi-family units, 4,200 square feet of retail and a 316 unit parking garage which is under construction in Weehawken, New Jersey.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	The loan had an outstanding balance of $5.1 million at December 31, 2016 .

1178970_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower s business.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Consumer loans generally entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of home equity loans and lines of credit secured by second lien positions, consumer loans that are unsecured or that are secured by assets that tend to depreciate, such as automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	Collateral repossessed by the Bank from a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, and the remaining deficiency may warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent upon the borrower s continued financial stability, and which is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount the Bank can recover on such loans.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P60_S3	The Credit Committee currently consists of eight senior officers including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Lending Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Credit Officer, and requires a majority vote for credit approval.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	While the Bank discourages loan policy exceptions, from time to time, based upon reasonable business considerations exceptions to the policy may be warranted.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	The business reason and mitigants for the exception must be noted on the loan approval document.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	The policy exception requires the approval of the Chief Lending Officer or the Department Manager of the lending department responsible for the underlying loan, if it is within his or her approval authority limit.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the credit risk assessment of its loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Bank s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to maintain an appropriate risk rating to each loan in their portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed accordingly.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Risk ratings are subject to review by the Credit Department during the underwriting and loan review processes.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S4	Loan review examinations are performed by an independent third party which validates the risk ratings on a sample basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S5	In addition, a risk rating can be adjusted at the weekly Credit Committee meeting and quarterly at management s Credit Risk Management Committee where they meet to review all loans rated a watch ("5") or worse.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S6	The Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P63_S7	The risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	The regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the regulatory lending limit was $121.4 million.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	The Bank s current internal policy limit on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers that constitute a group exposure is up to $80.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "2" or better, up to $70.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "3", and up to $50.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "4".
1178970_17_ITEM1_P64_S3	Maximum group exposure limits may be lower depending on the type of loans involved.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	The borrower, headquartered in New Jersey, is an experienced real estate owner and developer in the state of New Jersey.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Management has determined that this exception to the internal group exposure policy limit is manageable and is mitigated by the borrower s diverse revenue mix, as well as its reputation and proven successful track record.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P65_S2	This lending relationship was approved as an exception to the internal policy limits by the management Credit Committee and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, and conformed to the regulatory limit applicable to the Bank at the time the loan was originated.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	In the case of residential mortgage and consumer loans, the collections personnel in the Bank s Asset Recovery Department are responsible for collection activities from the sixteenth day of delinquency.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P68_S1	Collection efforts include automated notices of delinquency, telephone calls, letters and other notices to delinquent borrowers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P68_S2	Foreclosure proceedings and other appropriate collection activities such as repossession of collateral are commenced within at least 90 to 120 days after a loan is delinquent provided a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency or other loss mitigation arrangement cannot be reached with the borrower.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P68_S3	Periodic inspections of real estate and other collateral are conducted throughout the collection process.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	The Bank s collection procedures for Federal Housing Association ( FHA ) and Veteran s Administration ( VA ) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection and loss mitigation guidelines outlined by those agencies.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer review all commercial real estate and commercial loan delinquencies on a weekly basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	Generally, delinquent commercial real estate and commercial loans are transferred to the Asset Recovery Department for further action if the delinquency is not cured within a reasonable period of time, typically 90 days.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	The Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer have the authority to transfer performing commercial real estate or commercial loans to the Asset Recovery Department if, in their opinion, a credit problem exists or is likely to occur.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	These reports include information on impaired loans, delinquent loans, criticized and classified assets, and foreclosed assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for TDRs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , there were 141 impaired loans totaling $52.0 million, of which 136 loans totaling $41.6 million were TDRs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	Included in this total were 114 TDRs to 110 borrowers totaling $29.9 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P76_S2	A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as substandard, doubtful or loss assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P77_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess potential weaknesses, are designated special mention.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P82_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2016 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described previously.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	At December 31, 2016 , $88.3 million of loans were classified as substandard, which consisted of $47.3 million in commercial loans, $23.6 million in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, $12.0 million in residential loans, $2.5 million in construction loans and $2.9 million in consumer loans.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	Non-performing commercial mortgage loans increased $6.2 million to $7.5 million at December 31, 2016 , from $1.3 million at December 31, 2015 .

1178970_17_ITEM1_P87_S16	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2016 are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P87_S17	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , there were 25 additions to foreclosed assets with a carrying value of $3.6 million and 31 properties sold with a carrying value of $5.4 million.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2016 was not material.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Department.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S7	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S8	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P93_S9	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S5	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S6	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period; these factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P94_S7	The most recent periodic review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors was completed in the third quarter of 2016 using historical loss data through June 30, 2016 and was applied effective September 30, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period; qualitative adjustments are recalibrated at least annually and evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	The range of adjustments to historical loss rates applicable to qualitative factors were updated in the third quarter of 2016 in conjunction with the review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the general allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency and non-performing loan trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	As a result of this process, management may establish an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses accounts for the inherent imprecision of the overall loss estimation process, including the periodic updating of appraisals, commercial loan risk ratings, and economic uncertainty that may not be fully captured in the Bank's loss history or the qualitative factors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S4	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S5	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P101_S6	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P103_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P103_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P103_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S8	The investment strategy considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S9	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P104_S10	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P105_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P105_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P105_S3	Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P105_S4	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P106_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P106_S2	If such an impairment was deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P106_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P107_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S9	At December 31, 2016 , the Bank held $1.2 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P108_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_17_ITEM1_P136_S2	The Company and the Bank are required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P136_S3	The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P136_S4	The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S0	The Bank is a New Jersey chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S1	The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as its deposit insurer.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S2	The Bank files reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S3	The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S4	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P137_S5	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P138_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P139_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P139_S1	Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are impacting the Company and the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P139_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P139_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has the authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P139_S4	However, institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and are subject to the enforcement authority of their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P140_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Bank had consolidated assets of $9.50 billion .
1178970_17_ITEM1_P141_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act established several measures that apply to institutions and holding companies once they reach $10 billion in assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P142_S0	In addition to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau compliance examinations, as discussed above, limits on debit card interchange fees apply, which will reduce the Bank s fee income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P142_S1	Certain enhanced prudential standards will also become applicable such as additional risk management requirements, both from a framework and corporate governance perspective.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P142_S2	Stress testing requirements and related filing requirements, which involve assessing the potential impact on the Bank and Company of various scenarios prescribed by the federal regulatory agencies, also become applicable.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P142_S3	These and other supervisory and regulatory implications of crossing the $10 billion threshold would likely result in increased regulatory costs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P143_S0	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S1	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in: (1) real estate mortgages; (2) consumer and commercial loans; (3) specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; (4) certain types of corporate equity securities; and (5) certain other assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S2	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S3	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of such investments.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S4	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S5	New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S6	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P144_S7	See Federal Banking Regulation-Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P145_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P145_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P145_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P146_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P146_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P146_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P147_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P147_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P147_S2	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P147_S3	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P148_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P149_S0	Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P149_S1	These capital requirements are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and were effective January 1, 2015.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P150_S0	In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P150_S1	Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S0	Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S1	Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S2	Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S3	Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S4	Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P151_S5	Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P152_S0	Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P152_S1	In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P152_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P152_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement was effective on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P152_S4	The following table shows the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2016 :
1178970_17_ITEM1_P153_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P153_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P154_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P155_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P155_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P155_S2	The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P156_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S2	As a member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLBNY stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P157_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2016 , dividends paid by the FHLBNY to the Bank totaled $3.5 million .
1178970_17_ITEM1_P158_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured by the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P159_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were originally assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P159_S1	An institution s assessment rate depended upon the category to which it was assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P159_S2	Institutions deemed less risky paid lower assessments.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P159_S3	No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of its federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P160_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P160_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) at 25 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P160_S2	However, as described below, there were recent changes to both the FDIC s assessment range and its risk-based assessment procedures.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P161_S0	The FDIC has established a long range target size for the DIF of 2 percent of insured deposits.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P161_S1	The FDIC s regulations also provided for a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reached 1.15% of total insured deposits.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P161_S2	The 1.15% ratio was achieved as of June 30, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P161_S3	As a result, effective July 1, 2016, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) has been lowered to 1.5 to 30 basis points for banks of less than $10 billion in consolidated assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P162_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires banks of greater than $10 billion of assets to pay to increase the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P162_S1	Consequently, also effective July 1, 2016, banks of greater than $10 billion of assets now pay a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on assets above $10 billion until the earlier of the reserve ratio reaching 1.35% or December 31, 2018 (when a short fall assessment would be applied).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P162_S2	At the same time, the FDIC eliminated the risk categories.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P162_S3	Most institutions are now assessed based on financial ratios derived from statistical models that estimate the probability of a bank s failure within three years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P162_S4	Banks of greater than $10 billion are assessed based on a rate derived from a scorecard which assesses certain factors such as examination ratings, financial measures related to the bank s ability to withstand stress and measures of loss severity to the DIF if the bank should fail.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P163_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P163_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P163_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P164_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P165_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P165_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. Section 23A:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P166_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P167_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P167_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P167_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P168_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P168_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P169_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P169_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P169_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P170_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P171_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P171_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P171_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P171_S3	In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P172_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P173_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P173_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of December 2014.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P173_S2	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P173_S3	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P174_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P174_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P175_S0	the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P175_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P175_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P175_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P176_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P176_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P176_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P176_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P177_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P178_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P179_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P179_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P180_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P181_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P181_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P181_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P181_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P182_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P182_S1	The previously discussed final rule that increased capital requirements effective January 1, 2015 adjusted the prompt action categories as reflected above.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P183_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P184_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for, comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P184_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P184_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P186_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities owed to a savings bank by its directors and executive officers and by corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P186_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S1	For 2017, the Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $15.5 million and up to $115.1 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $115.1 million.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S2	The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P187_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P188_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P189_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P189_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P189_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have targeted various aspects of internet banking, including the security and systems.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P189_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s Internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P190_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P190_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P190_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P191_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P191_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P191_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P191_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P191_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S0	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S1	The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S2	The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S3	Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies (with greater than $1 billion of assets) as of January 1, 2015.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S4	As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was effective on January 1, 2016, and will increase each year until fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P192_S5	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company s regulatory capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P193_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P193_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P193_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P194_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P194_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P195_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P195_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P196_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P196_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P197_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P198_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P199_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P199_S1	Financial holding companies may engage in a broader array of activities including insurance and investment banking.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P200_S0	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if at the time of the election and on a continuing basis:
1178970_17_ITEM1_P201_S0	each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a Satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P202_S0	The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014 which was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve Board on March 5, 2015.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P203_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P203_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P204_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P204_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P204_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P205_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P206_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P206_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P207_S0	Investment Adviser Regulation Each of Beacon Investment Advisory Services, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC are investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P207_S1	As such, they are required to make certain filings with and are subject to periodic examination by, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P208_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P208_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P208_S2	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P208_S3	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P208_S4	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P209_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P209_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P210_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2016 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P211_S6	At December 31, 2016 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $20.8 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P212_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_17_ITEM1_P212_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P212_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P213_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P213_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P214_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P214_S1	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had approximately $2.0 million of Federal Net Operating Losses ("NOLs").
1178970_17_ITEM1_P214_S2	These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P215_S0	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P216_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P216_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P217_S0	is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P217_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporation business tax at 9% of apportioned taxable income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P218_S0	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P218_S1	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P218_S2	As a result of the acquisition of Team Capital in 2014, the Bank is now subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax.
1178970_17_ITEM1_P218_S3	Mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5 percent on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	Our interest-bearing liabilities generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Until recently, the Federal Reserve Board had maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	If the Federal Reserve Board s recent policy action to increase short-term rates does not result in a commensurate increase in long-term rates, we may experience a flattening or inverted yield curve that would negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Further, if rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than we can increase the interest rates we earn on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S3	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S4	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 2.2% or $6.0 million .
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S5	Conversely, should market interest rates fall below current levels, our net interest income could also be negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease more rapidly through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S6	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S7	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S8	At December 31, 2016, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.04 billion .
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S9	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S10	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P1_S11	We are also subject to prepayment and reinvestment risk related to interest rate movements.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Increases in interest rates can result in extending the average life of our loans and mortgage related securities, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available to invest in higher-yielding assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	We are subject to liquidity risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost within acceptable risk tolerances.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan originations and commitments, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments, sales, maturities, and prepayments of loans and investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P5_S3	Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews and credit risk ratings, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S5	Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S6	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S7	A significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S8	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S9	In addition, our construction loans, commercial mortgage loans, multi-family loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S10	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P6_S11	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, earnings could be adversely affected.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In 2006, the FDIC, the OCC and the FRB (collectively, the Agencies ) issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ).
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans ( CRE Loans ), represent 300% or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the CRE Loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Our level of CRE Loans equaled 451% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	While our level of CRE Loans equaled 451% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2016, our CRE Loan portfolio has not increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the 2015 Statement ).
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If the FDIC were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our loan portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, our earnings would be adversely affected.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Our success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers mostly located in our primary markets.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations and the value of the collateral securing our loans.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	sales may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S3	A general economic slowdown or uncertainty that produces either reduced returns or excessive market volatility could adversely impact our wealth management fee income.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S4	A general economic slowdown could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P12_S5	Furthermore, conditions that produce extended market volatility could affect our ability to provide our customers with an adequate return, thereby causing them to seek more stable investment opportunities with alternative wealth advisors.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The financial services industry continues to experience increasing numbers of severe cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access or blocking access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of cyber attacks, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processers, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data and maintain cyber-resiliency may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Our customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S5	Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S6	We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S7	The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S8	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S9	We will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements if we were to exceed total assets of $10.0 billion.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S10	Provident's total assets were $9.5 billion at December 31, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S11	Banks with assets in excess of $10.0 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations including the examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assess our compliance with federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, enhanced risk management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S12	As we approach $10.0 billion in assets, we are incurring additional costs to prepare for the implementation of these imposed requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S13	We may be required to invest more significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S14	Further, federal financial regulators may require us to accelerate our actions and investments to prepare for compliance before we exceed $10.0 billion in total consolidated assets, and may suspend or delay certain regulatory actions, such as approving a merger agreement, if they deem our preparations to be inadequate.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S15	Upon reaching this threshold, we face the risk that we fail to meet these requirements, which may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S16	While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S17	The short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and new capital rules is uncertain.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S18	The federal banking agencies have adopted proposals that have substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S19	The amendments implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S20	The new rules apply regulatory capital requirements to both the Bank and the consolidated Company.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P15_S21	The amended rules included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with the phase-in of certain requirements commencing in 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	The amended rules also establish a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in until fully implemented in January 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	The Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will result in generally higher regulatory capital standards.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Bank and the consolidated Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S7	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense and expanding with entrants into our market providing new and innovative technology-driven financial solutions.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S8	We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, online lenders, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating both locally and elsewhere.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S9	In particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S10	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors in our market.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S11	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P17_S12	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers, who are used extensively in support of our operations, to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, the occurrence of systems failures and disruptions, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	While we maintain a risk management program that is designed to minimize risk, we could suffer losses, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The metropolitan New York and Northern New Jersey areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism, including cyber attacks, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage, cause disruption of power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	At December 31, 2016 , goodwill totaling $411.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_17_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Property At December 31, 2016 , the Bank conducted business through 87 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.

1178970_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol PFS.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	Trading in the Company s common stock commenced on January 16, 2003.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of February 1, 2017, there were 83,209,293 shares of the Company s common stock issued and 66,428,706 shares outstanding, and approximately 5,083 stockholders of record.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P0_S3	The table below shows the high and low closing prices reported on the NYSE for the Company s common stock, as well as the cash dividends paid per common share during the periods indicated.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	On January 27, 2017 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per common share, which was paid on February 28, 2017, to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2017.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Company s Board of Directors intends to review the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, subject to financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, industry standards, economic conditions, regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and other relevant factors.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or immediately preceding year.
1178970_17_ITEM5_P1_S4	In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if: (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

1178970_17_ITEM7_P0_S0	General On January 15, 2003, the Company became the holding company for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating full-service branches and loan production offices throughout northern and central New Jersey, as well as Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2016 , these commercial loan types accounted for 75.3% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 24.7% .
1178970_17_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to focus on commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial lending relationships.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P3_S3	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P3_S4	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	Core deposits, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P4_S1	At December 31, 2016 , core deposits were 90.1% of total deposits.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P5_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, loan level swap fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Acquisitions On April 1, 2015, Beacon Trust Company ("Beacon"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Provident Bank, completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of The MDE Group, Inc. and the equity interests of Acertus Capital Management, LLC (together "MDE"), both Morristown, New Jersey-based registered investment advisory firms that manage assets for affluent and high net-worth clients.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	MDE was acquired with both cash and contingent consideration.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company recognized goodwill of $18.3 million and a customer relationship intangible of $7.0 million related to the acquisition.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Company recognized a contingent consideration liability at its fair value of $338,000.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S4	The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay additional cash consideration to MDE s former stakeholders four years after the closing of the acquisition if certain revenue targets are met.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S5	The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a discounted cash flow model.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S6	The acquisition agreement limits the total payment to a maximum of $12.5 million, to be determined based on actual future results.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P7_S7	In accordance with the acquisition agreement and based upon the Company's projection of future revenue, no contingent consideration liability was required at December 31, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P8_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P8_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P8_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S4	The Company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S5	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P10_S6	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Department.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party, and periodically by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P11_S8	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk rating.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	Quantitative loss factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P12_S3	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	present over the look back period.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P13_S1	Qualitative adjustments are evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P13_S2	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a general decline in the economy, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of elevated unemployment, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S5	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis giving consideration to historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S6	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S7	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally can combine to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S8	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S9	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S10	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S11	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S12	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P14_S13	Additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments, including goodwill, investment securities and deferred tax assets.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P15_S1	Management qualitatively determines whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before performing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P15_S2	If an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the entity would be required to perform Step 1 of the assessment and then, if needed, Step 2 to determine whether goodwill is impaired.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P15_S3	However, if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, the entity does not need to apply the two-step impairment test.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	For this analysis, the Reporting Unit is defined as the Bank, which includes all core and retail banking operations of the Company but excludes the assets, liabilities, equity, earnings and operations held exclusively at the Company level.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	The guidance provides certain factors an entity should consider in its qualitative assessment in determining whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in economic condition and limited access to capital.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Industry and market considerations, such as increased competition, regulatory developments and decline in market-dependent multiples.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Cost factors, such as increased labor costs, cost of materials and other operating costs.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Overall financial performance, such as declining cash flows and decline in revenue or earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	Other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in management, strategy or customers, litigation and contemplation of bankruptcy.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Reporting unit events, such as selling or disposing a portion of a reporting unit and a change in composition of assets.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	The Company may, based upon its qualitative assessment, or at its option, perform the two-step process to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P24_S1	If, based upon Step 1, the fair value of the Reporting Unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the Reporting Unit is considered not impaired.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P24_S2	However, if the carrying amount of the Reporting Unit exceeds its fair value, an additional test must be performed.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	The second step test compares the implied fair value of the Reporting Unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P25_S1	An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM7_P26_S1	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, such that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis (Step 1) was warranted.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P28_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, Management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P28_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P29_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P29_S2	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P29_S3	If either exists, the entire decline in value is considered other-than-temporary and would be recognized as an expense in the current period.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P29_S4	In its evaluations, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge on securities for the years ended 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, utilization against carry-back years and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The Company did not require a valuation allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1178970_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P32_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

1178970_17_ITEM7_P41_S3	The increase in core deposits for the year ended December 31, 2016 was largely attributable to a $330.4 million increase in interest bearing demand deposits, a $159.8 million increase in non-interest bearing demand deposits, a $114.4 million increase in money market deposits and a $113.5 million increase in savings deposits.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P41_S4	At December 31, 2016 , core deposits represented 90.1% of total deposits compared to 87.5% at December 31, 2015 .

1178970_17_ITEM7_P43_S3	Net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was favorably impacted by year-over-year growth in average loans outstanding resulting from organic originations, and increases in both average interest bearing core deposits and average non-interest bearing demand deposits, partially offset by compression in the net interest margin.
1178970_17_ITEM7_P43_S4	The growth in average core deposits mitigated the Company's need to utilize higher-cost borrowings to fund loan growth.

1178970_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The guidelines of the Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets and liabilities, earnings and capital.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal funds rate or LIBOR.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Investment securities purchases generally have maturities of five years or less, and mortgage-backed securities have weighted average lives initially between three and five years.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Asset/Liability Committee meets on at least a monthly basis to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income and economic value of equity.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	Members of the Asset/Liability Committee include the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other senior officers from across various disciplines in the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core-funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 9.9% at December 31, 2016 , compared to 12.5% at December 31, 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Certificate of deposit accounts are generally short-term.

1178970_17_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The Company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is reliant upon remaining competitively priced within the marketplace.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P4_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the Company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLB of New York during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The Company periodically reviews historical deposit repricing activity and makes modifications to certain assumptions used in its income simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P5_S4	These modifications are made to more precisely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2016 , in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 2.2% , or $6.0 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 3.2% , or $8.7 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2016 , in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 10.9% , or $150.2 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P11_S1	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 2.6% , or $35.8 million increase in the present value of equity.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P12_S2	While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P12_S3	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM7A_P12_S4	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S0	We have audited Provident Financial Services, Inc. s (the Company ) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S1	The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P4_S7	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P5_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P5_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P5_S2	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P5_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P5_S4	In our opinion, Provident Financial Services, Inc. and subsidiary maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 , based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	Certain reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform with current year classifications.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	Business The Company, through the Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through branch offices in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions and to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies, and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions about future events.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S1	These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P14_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with original maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P16_S1	Securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as investment securities held to maturity and reported at amortized cost.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P16_S2	Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held to maturity are classified as securities available for sale and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity, net of deferred taxes.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	The estimated fair values of the Company s securities are affected by changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and market illiquidity.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P17_S2	To determine if a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P17_S3	If such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, the Company would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P17_S4	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	In general, as interest rates rise, the market value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the market value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P18_S1	The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLBNY ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLBNY at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P23_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P24_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectibility is reasonably assured.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P25_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	Purchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI ) loans, are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, with no allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P26_S2	The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value of the PCI loans at acquisition represents the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P26_S3	Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition represent the non-accretable discount and are not recognized as a yield adjustment or a valuation allowance.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P26_S4	Reclassifications of the non-accretable to accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to an increase in expected cash flows of the loans and results in an increase in interest income on a prospective basis.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P27_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	Such agencies may require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P29_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings, and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P31_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P31_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S4	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P32_S5	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S5	As permitted by GAAP, the Company prepares a qualitative assessment in determining whether goodwill may be impaired.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S6	The factors considered in the assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S7	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P35_S8	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis was warranted.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and MDE, and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years and 10.4 years, respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter and the amount of shares allocated during the quarter.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	The Bank has an Equity Plan designed to provide competitive compensation for demonstrated performance and to align the interests of participants directly to increases in shareholder value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Equity Plan provides for performance-vesting grants as well as time-vesting grants.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Time-vesting stock awards, stock options and performance vesting stock awards that are based on a performance condition, such as return on average assets are valued on the closing stock price on the date of grant.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	Performance vesting stock awards and options that are based on a market condition, such as Total Shareholder Return, would be valued using a generally accepted statistical technique to simulate future stock prices for Provident and the components of the Peer Group which Provident would be measured against.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Expense related to time vesting stock awards and stock options is based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant and on the fair value of the stock options on the date of the grant, respectively, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Performance vesting stock awards and stock options are either dependent upon a market condition or a performance condition.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	A market condition performance metric is tied to a stock price, either on an absolute basis, or a relative basis against peers, while a performance-condition is based on internal operations, such as earnings per share.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The expense related to a market condition performance-vesting stock award or stock option requires an initial Monte Carlo simulation to determine grant date fair value, which will be recognized as a compensation expense regardless of actual payout, assuming that the executive is still employed at the end of the requisite service period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	If pre-vesting termination (forfeiture) occurs, then any expense recognized to date can be reversed.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S4	The grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the performance period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P44_S5	The expense related to a performance condition stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted periodically based upon the number of awards or options expected to be earned, recognized over the performance period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	These accounts will be liquidated as shares are distributed from the DDFP in accordance with the plan document.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P45_S4	At December 31, 2016 , there were 334,433 shares held by the DDFP.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Bank maintains a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain executives who are prevented from receiving the full benefits contemplated by the 401(k) Plan s and the ESOP s benefit formulas under tax law limits for tax-qualified plans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Bank provides post-retirement health care and life insurance plans to certain of its employees.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The life insurance coverage is noncontributory to the participant.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	Participants contribute to the cost of medical coverage based on the employee s length of service with the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	On December 31, 2002, the Bank eliminated postretirement healthcare benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	These interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	As such, all changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S4	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S5	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P51_S6	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analyses using observable market-based inputs.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income (loss).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Segment Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing traditional banking and other financial services to its customers.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Shares issued and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The main objective of this ASU is to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring impairment charges be based upon the first step in the current two-step impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	Currently, if the fair value of a reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount (Step 1), an entity calculates any impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the reporting unit s fair value as determined in Step 1.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S4	To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, entities estimate the fair value of any unrecognized intangible assets and any corporate-level assets or liabilities that were included in the determination of the carrying amount and fair value of the reporting unit in Step 1.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S5	Under ASU 2017-04, if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S6	The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S7	This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S8	ASU 2017-04 does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S9	Under ASU 2017-04, an entity will still be able to perform the current optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S10	The standard will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S11	Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S12	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S13	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S14	The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S15	The amendments in this ASU require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S16	The allowance for credit losses would represent a valuation account that would be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S17	The income statement would reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S18	The measurement of expected credit losses would be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S19	An entity will be required to use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S20	The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S21	Early adoption of this ASU is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P59_S22	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and accounting for forfeitures.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S3	Upon adoption, the Company recorded an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S4	In addition, ASU No. 2016-09 requires that excess tax benefits and shortfalls be recorded as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement, rather than as equity.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P60_S5	This resulted in an immaterial benefit to income tax expense in the third quarter of 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Relative to forfeitures, ASU No. 2016-09 allows an entity s accounting policy election to either continue to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, or account for forfeitures when they occur.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Company has elected to account for forfeitures when they occur.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	The income tax effects of ASU No. 2016-09 on the statement of cash flows are now classified as cash flows from operating activities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P61_S3	In accordance with the guidance, the Company has applied this classification on the consolidated statements of cash flows prospectively and, therefore, prior periods have not been adjusted.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P61_S4	ASU No. 2016-09 also requires the presentation of certain employee withholding taxes as a financing activity on the consolidated statements of cash flows, and in accordance with the guidance, the Company has applied this classification retrospectively on both the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity, with adjustments made to prior periods.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	A modified retrospective approach must be applied for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S5	The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S6	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P64_S7	Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	The amendments in this update apply to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	In these cases, the acquirer must record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	Based on specific assumptions about collateral and vintage, a range of possible cash flows was identified to determine whether other-than-temporary impairment existed during the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	The following table presents a roll-forward of the credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) on debt securities for which a non-credit component of OTTI was recognized in other comprehensive income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	OTTI recognized in earnings after that date for credit-impaired debt securities is presented as an addition in two components, based upon whether the current period is the first time a debt security was credit-impaired (initial credit impairment) or is not the first time a debt security was credit impaired (subsequent credit impairment).

1178970_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	The temporary loss position associated with debt securities is the result of changes in interest rates relative to the coupon of the individual security and changes in credit spreads.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	In addition, there remains a lack of liquidity in certain sectors of the mortgage-backed securities market.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	Increases in delinquencies and foreclosures have resulted in limited trading activity and significant price declines, regardless of favorable movements in interest rates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	The Company does not have the intent to sell securities in a temporary loss position at December 31, 2016 , nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P88_S4	This loan was past maturity and well secured at December 31, 2015, which subsequent to the end of the year was refinanced by the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P88_S5	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $2.2 million , $1.2 million and $1.9 million , for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P88_S6	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $1.5 million , $1.9 million and $2.3 million respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P89_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P89_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P89_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analysis of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	A third-party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P92_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P92_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses as a result of this process.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	At December 31, 2016 , there were 141 impaired loans totaling $52.0 million , of which 136 loans totaling $41.6 million were TDRs.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	The allowance for loan losses is summarized by portfolio segment and impairment classification, excluding PCI loans as follows (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	Loan modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P97_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following tables present the number of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and their balances immediately prior to the modification date and post-modification as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as previously discussed.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	Estimated collateral values of collateral dependent impaired loans modified during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 exceeded the carrying amounts of such loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P100_S2	There were no charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P100_S3	There were $465,000 of charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P100_S4	The allowance for loan losses associated with the TDRs presented in the preceding tables totaled $187,000 and $99,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively and were included in the allowance for loan losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	The TDRs presented in the preceding tables had a weighted average modified interest rate of approximately 5.25% and 5.25% , compared to a yield of 4.25% and 5.71% prior to modification for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The following table presents loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months from December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and for which there was a payment default (90 days or more past due) during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1178970_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	TDRs that subsequently default are considered collateral dependent impaired loans and are evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less expected selling costs.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	PCI loans are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P103_S1	As part of the Team Capital acquisition, $5.2 million of the loans purchased at May 30, 2014 were determined to be PCI loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	PCI loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, with no related allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	The following table presents information regarding the estimates of the contractually required payments, the cash flows expected to be collected and the estimated fair value of the PCI loans acquired from Team Capital at May 30, 2014 (in thousands):

1178970_17_ITEM8_P105_S1	The $2.1 million and $3.9 million decrease from December 31, 2015 and the May 31, 2014 acquisition date was largely due to the full repayment and greater than projected cash flows on certain PCI loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P105_S2	This resulted in a $848,000 and a $230,000 increase in interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, due to the acceleration of accretable and non-accretable discount on these loans.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $1.55 billion and $866.4 million , at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $279.8 million and $287.9 million , at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively) exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P113_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P114_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P115_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P115_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Department.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P116_S8	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	The pension plan s assets are invested in investment funds and group annuity contracts currently managed by the Principal Financial Group and Allmerica Financial.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P133_S2	Based on the measurement date of December 31, 2016 , no contributions will be made to the pension plan in 2017 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	In an effort to lower and reduce the volatility of its future pension costs, the Company offered a lump sum pension distribution option to its terminated vested employees in the quarter ended June 30, 2014.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Plan paid $4.3 million to those employees that elected to receive lump sum pension distributions and the Company realized an associated charge of $1.3 million .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	This charge was a pro rata share of the unrecognized losses recorded in other comprehensive income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	In addition to pension benefits, certain healthcare and life insurance benefits are currently made available to certain of the Bank s retired employees.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	Effective January 1, 2003, eligibility for retiree health care benefits was frozen as to new entrants and benefits were eliminated for employees with less than ten years of service as of December 31, 2002.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the introduction of the updated mortality data resulted in an actuarial loss of $1.5 million and $3.0 million for the pension and post-retirement plans, respectively, and was reflected in other comprehensive income (loss).

1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	The Company provides its actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring the benefit obligation.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period-end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow-yield curve model specific to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S4	The Company compares this rate to certain market indices, such as long-term treasury bonds, or the Citigroup pension liability indices, for reasonableness.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P140_S5	A discount rate of 4.25% was selected for the December 31, 2016 measurement date.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	The Company s expected return on pension plan assets assumption is based on historical investment return experience and evaluation of input from the Investment Consultant and the Company's Benefits Committee which manages the pension plan s assets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P144_S1	The expected return on pension plan assets is also impacted by the target allocation of assets, which is based on the Company s goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P144_S2	Management strives to have pension plan assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have a significant detrimental impact on the entire portfolio.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P144_S3	The target allocation of assets and acceptable ranges around the targets are as follows:

1178970_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset per share as a practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P146_S1	The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented on the Statement of Net Assets Available for Benefit.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	The Company anticipates that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	Actual asset allocations are the result of investment decisions by a third-party investment manager.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Supplemental ESOP was amended and restated as the Non-Qualified Supplemental Defined Contribution Plan (the Supplemental DC Plan ), effective January 1, 2010.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	The Supplemental DC Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides additional benefits to certain executives whose benefits under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP are limited by tax law limitations applicable to tax-qualified plans.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S3	The Supplemental DC Plan requires a contribution by the Bank for each participant who also participates in the 401(k) Plan and ESOP equal to the amount that would have been contributed under the terms of the 401(k) Plan and ESOP but for the tax law limitations, less the amount actually contributed under the 401(k) Plan and ESOP.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S4	The Supplemental DC Plan provides for a phantom stock allocation for qualified contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified ESOP and for matching contributions that may not be accrued in the qualified 401(k) Plan due to tax law limitations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S5	Under the Supplemental 401(k) provision, the estimated expense for the year ending December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $25,750 , $11,500 and $10,500 , respectively, and included the matching contributions plus interest credited at an annual rate equal to the ten-year bond-equivalent yield on U.S. Treasury securities.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P154_S7	The phantom equity is treated as equity awards (expensed at the time of allocation) and not liability awards which would require periodic adjustment to market, as participants do not have an option to take their distribution in cash.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	The Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan Upon stockholders approval of the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan on April 4, 2014, shares available for stock awards and stock options under the 2008 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan were reserved for issuance under the new Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan.

1178970_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	The total fair value of options vesting during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $247,000 , $274,000 and $438,000 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	Compensation expense of approximately $153,000 , $78,000 and $6,000 is projected for 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , respectively, on stock options outstanding at December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2016 :
1178970_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	The stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable at December 31, 2016 have an aggregate intrinsic value of $6,897,000 and $6,647,000 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	The expense related to stock options is based on the fair value of the options at the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the options.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	Compensation expense related to the Company s stock option plan totaled $172,000 , $272,000 and $298,000 for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	The estimated fair values were determined on the dates of grant using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	The fair value of the Company stock option awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the stock option.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	The risk-free rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a term approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P163_S2	The expected volatility computation is based on historical volatility over a period approximating the expected term of the option.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P163_S3	The dividend yield is based on the annual dividend payment per share, divided by the grant date stock price.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	The expected option term is a function of the option life and the vesting period.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	The fair value of the option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
1178970_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	The weighted average fair value of options granted during 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $2.26 , $2.52 and $1.64 per option, respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	(12) Income Taxes The current and deferred amounts of income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	Additionally, the Company recorded a deferred tax expense (benefit) of $2.3 million , $866,000 and ($3.8) million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, related to the amortization of post-retirement benefit obligations, which is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P169_S0	A reconciliation between the amount of reported total income tax expense and the amount computed by multiplying the applicable statutory income tax rate is as follows (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P170_S0	The net deferred tax asset is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P170_S1	The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P171_S0	Retained earnings at December 31, 2016 includes approximately $51.8 million for which no provision for income tax has been made.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P171_S1	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P171_S2	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include the failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to stockholders.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P171_S3	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had an unrecognized tax liability of $20.8 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P172_S0	As a result of the Beacon acquisition in 2011, the Company acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P172_S1	There are approximately $2.0 million of NOL carryforwards available to offset future taxable income as of December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P172_S2	If not utilized, these carryforwards will expire in 2030.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P172_S3	Also, the Company's New Jersey NOL carryforwards are approximately $1.3 million which are scheduled to expire in 2030.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P172_S4	At December 31, 2015, the Company had Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.0 million and anticipates full utilization of the carryforward in 2016.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P173_S0	The federal NOLs are subject to a combined annual Code Section 382 limitation in the amount of approximately $900,000 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	Management has determined that it is more likely than not that it will realize the net deferred tax asset based upon the nature and timing of the items listed above.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P174_S1	In order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P174_S2	Management has projected that the Company will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net deferred tax asset; however, there can be no assurance that such levels of taxable income will be generated.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Company s policy is to report interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P175_S1	The Company did not have any liabilities for uncertain tax positions or any known unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return and each entity files a separate state income tax return.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P176_S1	The Company's federal income tax returns are open for examination from 2013 and the state income tax returns are open for examination from 2012.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P176_S2	Currently, the 2014 federal income tax return is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	(13) Lease Commitments The approximate future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of taxes and other related charges, for all significant non-cancellable operating leases at December 31, 2016 , are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	Rental expense was $8.7 million , $8.9 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P179_S1	In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial position of the Company will not be materially affected by the outcome of such commitments or contingent liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	A substantial portion of the Bank s loans are secured by real estate located in New Jersey.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P181_S1	Accordingly, the collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes in local real estate market conditions.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P182_S0	(15) Regulatory Capital Requirements FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	Under the regulations in effect at December 31, 2016 , the Bank is required to maintain: (1) a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4.0% ; (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5% ; (3) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0% ; and (4) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0% .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P182_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P182_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement was effective on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	Under its prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P183_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P184_S1	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has: a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% ; a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% ; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00% ; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00% .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P185_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P185_S3	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P185_S4	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P186_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P186_S2	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P187_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P187_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	The following table shows the Company s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , compared to the FRB minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FRB requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	The following table shows the Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , compared to the FDIC minimum capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC requirements for classification as a well-capitalized institution (dollars in thousands).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P190_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P190_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P190_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P190_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P191_S0	GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P191_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P191_S2	The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1178970_17_ITEM8_P192_S0	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P193_S1	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P193_S2	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P196_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P196_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P197_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the statement of financial condition at fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P198_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	The existing interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S2	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S3	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S4	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with FHLBNY borrowings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S5	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P199_S6	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs, which are considered Level 2 inputs.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P201_S1	Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P201_S3	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case-by-case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, as well as adjustments for estimated costs to sell which range between 5% and 10% .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P201_S4	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs, which range between 5% and 10% .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P202_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P202_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P205_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P207_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P208_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P208_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P211_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P212_S6	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	The carrying value of FHLBNY stock was its cost.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P213_S1	The fair value of FHLBNY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P214_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P214_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P214_S3	The fair value of performing loans was estimated using a combination of techniques, including a discounted cash flow model that utilizes a discount rate that reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P214_S4	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans was based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its non-performing loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S3	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, was equal to the amount payable on demand and classified as Level 1.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S4	The estimated fair value of certificates of deposit was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P215_S5	The discount rate was estimated using the Company s current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its certificates of deposit portfolio as Level 2.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and was classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P217_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P217_S2	Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P217_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P218_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P218_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	The following tables present the Company s financial instruments at their carrying and fair values as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	Fair values are presented by level within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	The following tables are a summary of certain quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the outstanding shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	Anti-dilutive stock options and awards totaling 432,895 shares, 469,018 shares and 988,931 shares at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, were excluded from the earnings per share calculations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	(20) Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income The following table presents the components of other comprehensive (loss) income both gross and net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	The following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	The following table summarizes the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):
1178970_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	(1) This item is included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P228_S2	The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P228_S3	Derivatives not designated in qualifying hedging relationships are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain qualifying commercial borrowers in loan related transactions and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P229_S1	Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	The interest rate swap agreement which the Company executes with the commercial borrower is collateralized by the borrower's property financed by the Company.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 , the Company had 36 and 23 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $582.2 million and $391.4 million , respectively, related to this program.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P231_S1	The Company has credit derivatives resulting from participations in interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company's assets or liabilities.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	Cash flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P232_S1	The Company s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P232_S2	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P233_S1	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P233_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2016 , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P234_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P234_S1	The Company implemented this program during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P234_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company s did not record any hedge ineffectiveness.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P234_S3	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P234_S4	During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $159,000 will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company had one outstanding interest rate derivative with a notional amount of $40.0 million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

1178970_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	The tables below present the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).
1178970_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P241_S1	In addition, the Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well/adequate capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P241_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest, was $1.4 million .
1178970_17_ITEM8_P241_S3	The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral of $220,000 against its obligations under these agreements.
1178970_17_ITEM8_P241_S4	If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2016 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s Principal Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Principal Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework ( COSO ) (2013).
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on the assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2016 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1178970_17_ITEM9A_P2_S3	The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 .

1178970_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Bank making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Because of the diversity of industries within the Bank s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	The northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Bank s most direct competition for deposits comes from several commercial banks and savings banks in its market area.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S3	Certain of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S4	In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund and investment advisory industries and from investors direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S5	The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiaries.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P15_S6	Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank s branch network, its deployment of branch ATMs, and its mobile, telephone and web-based banking services.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate and other consumer loans, for borrowers generally located within its primary market area.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Generally, these loans have maturities of either 5 or 10 years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	For loans greater than $5.0 million originated with maturities in excess of 7 years, the Bank generally requires loan-level interest rate swaps for qualified borrowers.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Bank has historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects, including residential rental projects that will be retained as investments by the borrower.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P19_S2	The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews, and to review all construction advances made against work in place, and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	In most cases, for the single family and condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held back until the leases are finalized.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Funding requirements and loan structure for residential rental projects vary depending on whether such projects are vertical or horizontal construction.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , $1.14 billion or 15.7 % of the total portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P27_S4	Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 67.2% were fixed-rate and 32.8% were adjustable-rate loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest payments due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Bank currently offers adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P28_S4	The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2.75%, adjusting annually after its first re-set period, with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S1	The Bank s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S2	However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S3	Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S4	Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 30 years or less.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S5	The Bank retains the majority of the originated adjustable-rate mortgages for its portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S6	Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S7	The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S8	In 2017 , $2.3 million or 1.9% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S9	All of the loans sold in 2017 were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S10	The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank s exposure to interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S11	However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P29_S12	The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $21.8 million.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $9.2 million for the past five years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Bank does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings and retail and industrial properties.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	loans were 29.9% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	A substantial majority of the Bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P35_S1	The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P35_S2	There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and expertise in the commercial real estate market.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	Among the reasons for the Bank s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S2	Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S3	In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project, and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S4	The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S5	The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P36_S6	If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Generally, for commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $1.0 million and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank requires environmental professionals to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Bank requires a full independent appraisal for commercial real estate properties.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	The appraiser must be selected from the Bank s approved list, or otherwise approved by the Chief Credit Officer in instances such as out-of-state or special use property.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	The Bank also employs an independent review appraiser to ensure that the appraisal meets the Bank s standards.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S4	Financial statements are also required annually for review.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P37_S5	The Bank s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $2.5 million be completed at least every 18 months, or more frequently when warranted.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	The Bank s largest commercial mortgage loan as of December 31, 2017 was a $39.1 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on eight office buildings and five industrial/flex buildings located throughout Middlesex and Somerset counties in New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	This was a refinance and consolidation of several loans to an existing customer with extensive experience and a successful track record.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	The loan has a risk rating of 2 (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be acceptable quality see discussion of the Bank s nine-point risk rating system for loans under Allowance for Loan Losses in the Asset Quality section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2017 .

1178970_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	The Bank considers multi-family lending a component of the commercial real estate lending portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	The underwriting standards and procedures that are used to underwrite commercial real estate loans are used to underwrite multi-family loans, except the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property, the debt-service coverage should be a minimum of 1.15 times and an amortization period of up to 30 years may be used.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Bank s largest multi-family loan as of December 31, 2017 was a $41.0 million loan secured by a first leasehold mortgage lien on a newly renovated 129-unit, six story class A luxury rental apartment building with 12,000 square feet of office/retail space located in Morristown, New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	The project sponsor is one of the largest privately-held real estate owner/developers in the United States, and has extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of multi-family projects.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	percentage of the for-sale single-family residences or condominiums be under contract to support construction loan advances; and requires other covenants on residential for rental projects depending on whether the project is vertical or horizontal construction.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	The Bank underwrites construction loans for a term of three years or less.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The majority of the Bank s construction loans are floating-rate loans with a maximum 75% loan-to-value ratio for the completed project.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P44_S2	The Bank employs professional engineering firms to assist in the review of construction cost estimates and make site inspections to determine if the work has been completed prior to the advance of funds for the project.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate or multi-family lending.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	For all construction loans, the Bank requires an independent appraisal, which includes information on market rents and/or comparable sales for competing projects.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Bank also obtains personal guarantees and conducts environmental due diligence as appropriate.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Bank also employs other means to mitigate the risk of the construction lending process.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P77_S2	An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P77_S4	Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess potential weaknesses, are designated special mention.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P79_S2	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P79_S3	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as loss, the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	The Bank s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P82_S1	The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P82_S2	Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the institution s loan and lease portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P82_S3	While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2017 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P87_S14	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , there were 16 additions to foreclosed assets with a carrying value of $3.8 million and 26 properties sold with a carrying value of $4.3 million.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P87_S15	Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2017 , consisted of $3.9 million of commercial real estate and $3.0 million of residential real estate.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P87_S16	Non-performing assets totaled $41.8 million , or 0.42% of total assets at December 31, 2017 , compared to $50.4 million , or 0.53% of total assets at December 31, 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P87_S17	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2017 was not material.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P89_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P89_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	Management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank s internal nine-point risk rating system.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Department.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S7	The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S8	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P92_S9	Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S2	The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S3	These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S4	Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S5	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S6	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look-back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period; these factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P93_S7	The most recent periodic review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors was completed in the third quarter of 2017 using historical loss data through June 30, 2017 and was applied effective September 30, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look-back period; qualitative adjustments are recalibrated at least annually and evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	The range of adjustments to historical loss rates applicable to qualitative factors were updated in the third quarter of 2017 in conjunction with the review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the general allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency and non-performing loan trends and peer group analysis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S4	Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S5	The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P99_S6	There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P100_S1	The following table sets forth the analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P101_S1	The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P101_S2	This allocation is based on management s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P101_S3	The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P101_S4	The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S0	The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S1	The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S2	Each of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer is authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S3	Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S4	The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S5	Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S6	The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S7	The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with the Investment Policy.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S8	The investment strategy considers the Bank s and the Company s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S9	Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers acceptances and Federal funds.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P102_S10	Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of A by Moody s or Standard Poor s at the time of purchase.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P103_S0	Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P103_S1	Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P103_S2	Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P103_S3	Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P103_S4	Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P104_S0	At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P104_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P104_S2	If such an impairment was deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P104_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P105_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P105_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S0	CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S1	In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S2	A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S3	Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S4	In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S5	During rising interest rate periods, the Bank s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S6	Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S7	Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S8	Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S9	At December 31, 2017 , the Bank held $102,000 in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P106_S10	The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P121_S2	Bank policies limit the use of repurchase agreements to collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations or mortgage-related securities.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P134_S3	The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank s compliance with various regulatory requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P134_S4	This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P134_S5	The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P135_S0	Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P136_S0	The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act ) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P136_S1	Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have impacted, and will continue to impact the Company and the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P136_S2	For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P136_S3	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has the authority to impose new requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P137_S0	authority of their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P138_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Bank had consolidated assets of $9.85 billion .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P139_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act established several measures that apply to institutions and holding companies once they reach $10 billion in assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P140_S0	In addition to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau compliance examinations, as discussed above, limits on debit card interchange fees apply, which will reduce the Bank s fee income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P140_S1	Certain enhanced prudential standards will also become applicable such as additional risk management requirements, both from a framework and corporate governance perspective.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P140_S2	Stress testing requirements and related filing requirements, which involve assessing the potential impact on the Bank and Company of various scenarios prescribed by the federal regulatory agencies, also become applicable.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P140_S3	These and other supervisory and regulatory implications of crossing the $10 billion threshold would likely result in increased regulatory costs.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P141_S0	The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. New Jersey Banking Regulation Activity Powers.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S0	The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S1	Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in: (1) real estate mortgages; (2) consumer and commercial loans; (3) specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; (4) certain types of corporate equity securities; and (5) certain other assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S2	A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a leeway power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S3	Leeway investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of such investments.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S4	A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S5	New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S6	The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P142_S7	See Federal Banking Regulation-Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank below.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P143_S0	With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank s capital funds.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P143_S1	A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P143_S2	The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P144_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P144_S1	In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P144_S2	Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P145_S0	Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P145_S1	At December 31, 2017 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P146_S0	The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P146_S1	The Department examines the Bank at least every two years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P147_S0	The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P148_S0	Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P148_S1	These capital requirements are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and were effective January 1, 2015.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P149_S0	In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P149_S1	Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S0	Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S1	Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S2	Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S3	Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S4	Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P150_S5	Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S0	Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S1	In assessing an institution s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement was effective on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S4	The capital conservation buffer during the calendar year 2017 was 1.25% and increased to 1.875% on January 1, 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P151_S5	The following table shows the Bank s Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2017 :
1178970_18_ITEM1_P152_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P152_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P152_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Bank was considered well capitalized under FDIC guidelines.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P153_S0	Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P153_S1	Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P154_S0	the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S0	Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S1	Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S2	In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S3	The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank s total assets or $50 billion.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S4	The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary s assets with the bank s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P155_S5	The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S0	The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S1	The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S2	As a member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB s capital plan and minimum capital requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S4	The Bank has received dividends on its FHLBNY stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P156_S5	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , dividends paid by the FHLBNY to the Bank totaled $4.1 million .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P157_S0	As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured by the FDIC s Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P158_S0	Under the FDIC s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were originally assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P158_S1	An institution s assessment rate depended upon the category to which it was assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P158_S2	Institutions deemed less risky paid lower assessments.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P158_S3	No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of its federal deposit insurance assessment.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P159_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P159_S1	The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) at 25 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P159_S2	However, as described below, there were recent changes to both the FDIC s assessment range and its risk-based assessment procedures.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P160_S0	The FDIC has established a long range target size for the DIF of 2 percent of insured deposits.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P160_S1	The FDIC s regulations also provided for a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reached 1.15% of total insured deposits.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P160_S2	The 1.15% ratio was achieved as of June 30, 2016.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P160_S3	As a result, effective July 1, 2016, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) has been lowered to 1.5 to 30 basis points for banks of less than $10 billion in consolidated assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P161_S0	The Dodd-Frank Act requires banks of greater than $10 billion of assets to pay to increase the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P161_S1	Consequently, also effective July 1, 2016, banks of greater than $10 billion of assets now pay a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on assets above $10 billion until the earlier of the reserve ratio reaching 1.35% or December 31, 2018 (when a short fall assessment would be applied).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P161_S2	At the same time, the FDIC eliminated the risk categories.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P161_S3	Most institutions are now assessed based on financial ratios derived from statistical models that estimate the probability of a bank s failure within three years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P161_S4	Banks of greater than $10 billion are assessed based on a rate derived from a scorecard which assesses certain factors such as examination ratings, financial measures related to the bank s ability to withstand stress and measures of loss severity to the DIF if the bank should fail.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P162_S0	The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P162_S1	This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P162_S2	In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P163_S0	Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P164_S0	An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P164_S1	A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P165_S0	requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P166_S0	The term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P166_S1	Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P166_S2	In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P167_S0	Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P167_S1	A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P168_S0	FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share non-public personal information to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P168_S1	The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P168_S2	In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to opt-out of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P169_S0	Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P170_S0	All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and borrowers (i.e. assessment(s)).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P170_S1	In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P170_S2	Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P170_S3	In particular, the current examination and evaluation process focuses on three tests:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P171_S0	a service test, to evaluate the institution s systems for delivering retail banking services through its branches, ATMs and other offices and access facilities, including the distribution of its branches, ATMs and other offices/access facilities, and the institution s record of opening and closing branches.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P172_S0	An institution s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P172_S1	The Bank received an Outstanding Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of December 2014.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P173_S0	In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of the borrower s characteristics as specified in those statutes.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P173_S1	An institution s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and/or the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P174_S0	Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P174_S1	In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P175_S0	the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P175_S1	In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P175_S2	If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed below.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P175_S3	If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P176_S0	Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P176_S1	Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P176_S2	The FDIC s regulations define the five capital categories as follows:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P176_S3	An institution will be treated as well capitalized if:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P177_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P178_S0	An institution will be treated as adequately capitalized if:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P179_S0	its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% and it is not a well-capitalized institution.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P179_S1	An institution will be treated as undercapitalized if:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P180_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 4% An institution will be treated as significantly undercapitalized if:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P181_S0	its leverage ratio is less than 3%.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P181_S1	An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed critically undercapitalized.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P181_S2	The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P181_S3	The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P182_S0	insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P182_S1	The previously discussed final rule that increased capital requirements effective January 1, 2015 adjusted the prompt action categories as reflected above.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S0	Loans to a Bank s Insiders Federal Regulation.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S1	A bank s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board s Regulation O.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S2	Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S3	All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S4	With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer s children and certain loans secured by the officer s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P183_S5	Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank s unimpaired capital and surplus.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P184_S0	Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for, comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P184_S1	An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P184_S2	In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P185_S0	The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P186_S0	Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities owed to a savings bank by its directors and executive officers and by corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P186_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S0	Federal Reserve System Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S1	For 2018, the Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $16.0 million and up to $122.3 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $122.3 million.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S2	The first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S3	The Bank is in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S4	These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P187_S5	Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank s interest-earning assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P188_S0	The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P189_S0	Internet Banking Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions and their customers conduct their business.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P189_S1	The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P189_S2	The federal bank regulatory agencies have targeted various aspects of internet banking, including the security and systems.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P189_S3	There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank s Internet operations or restrict any such further operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P190_S0	The USA PATRIOT Act The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P190_S1	By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P190_S2	Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S0	The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S1	Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S2	In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S3	The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S4	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S5	The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S6	The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S7	The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S8	Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies (with greater than $1 billion of assets) as of January 1, 2015.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S9	As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was effective on January 1, 2016, and will increase each year until fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S10	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company s regulatory capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P191_S11	The following table shows the Company s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM1_P192_S0	(1) For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P192_S1	In calculating common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P192_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was well capitalized under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P193_S0	Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P193_S1	Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P194_S0	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P194_S1	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P195_S0	As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P195_S1	Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S0	A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company s consolidated net worth.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S1	The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S2	Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S3	In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S4	One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P196_S5	Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P197_S0	acquiring a savings and loan association.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P198_S0	Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P198_S1	Financial holding companies may engage in a broader array of activities including insurance and investment banking.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P199_S0	Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if at the time of the election and on a continuing basis:
1178970_18_ITEM1_P200_S0	each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a Satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P201_S0	The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014 which was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve Board on March 5, 2015.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P202_S0	Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P202_S1	This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P203_S0	Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P203_S1	The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms company and bank holding company as such terms are defined under the BHCA.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P203_S2	Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P204_S0	Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P205_S0	The Company s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P205_S1	The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P206_S0	Investment Adviser Regulation Beacon Investment Advisory Services, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the SEC.

1178970_18_ITEM1_P207_S0	The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P207_S1	As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P207_S2	The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P207_S3	The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P208_S0	On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") was enacted.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P208_S1	Included as part of the law, was a permanent reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P208_S2	Based upon the change in the tax rate, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced rate that will apply in future periods when theses deferred taxes are settled or realized.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P208_S3	As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, the Company recognized an additional tax expense of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P208_S4	For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P209_S0	Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act ), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P209_S1	These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P210_S0	The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S0	Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S1	Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S2	Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S3	Retained earnings at December 31, 2017 included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S4	This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S5	Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P211_S6	At December 31, 2017 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $13.7 million with respect to this reserve.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P212_S0	The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI).
1178970_18_ITEM1_P212_S1	The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P212_S2	Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P213_S0	Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P213_S1	The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P213_S2	The recently enacted Tax Act repeals the corporate AMT effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P214_S0	Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P214_S1	At December 31, 2017 , the Company had approximately $1.3 million of Federal Net Operating Losses ("NOLs").
1178970_18_ITEM1_P214_S2	These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P214_S3	The Tax Act limits limits the NOL deduction for a given year to 80% of taxable income, effective with respect to losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P215_S0	pre-enactment carryback provision for NOLs and provides for the indefinite carryforward of NOLs arrising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P216_S0	The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P217_S0	State Taxation New Jersey State Taxation.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P217_S1	The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P218_S0	Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P218_S1	The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporation business tax at 9% of apportioned taxable income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P219_S0	New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P219_S1	However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P220_S0	The Bank is subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P220_S1	Mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5% on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P221_S0	In 2014, New York State enacted significant and comprehensive reforms to its corporate tax system that went into effect January 1, 2015.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P221_S1	The new legislation resulted in significant changes to the method of calculating income taxes for banks, including changes to future period tax rates, rules relating to the sourcing of income, and the elimination of the banking corporation tax so that banking corporations will now be taxed under New York State s corporate franchise tax.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P222_S0	The corporate franchise tax is based on the combined entire net income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 6.5%.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P222_S1	The amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State under the new legislation can be expected to fluctuate over time.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P223_S0	Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P223_S1	The MTA surcharge for 2017 was 28.3% of a recomputed New York State franchise tax, calculated using a 6.5% tax rate on allocated and apportioned entire net income.
1178970_18_ITEM1_P223_S2	The Bank is currently under audit with respect to its New York State combined franchise tax return for tax years 2015 and 2016.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates, and the degree to which these changes disparately impact short-term and long-term interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The Federal Reserve Board has maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and recently shifted its strategy to a measured approach of increasing the targeted federal funds rate.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	If the Federal Reserve Board s recent policy action to increase short-term rates does not result in a commensurate increase in long-term rates, we may experience a flattening or inverted yield curve that could negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Our interest-bearing liabilities may be subject to repricing or maturing more quickly than our interest-earning assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If rates increase rapidly, we may have to increase the rates we pay on our deposits and borrowed funds more quickly than we can increase the interest rates we earn on our loans and investments, resulting in a negative effect on interest spreads and net interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P2_S3	In addition, the effect of rising rates could be compounded if deposit customers move funds into higher yielding accounts.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, and assuming management took no actions to mitigate the effect of such change, we are projecting that our net interest income would decrease 3.8% or $11.2 million .
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	negatively affected if competitive pressures keep us from further reducing rates on our deposits, while the yields on our assets decrease through loan prepayments and interest rate adjustments.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest-earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	Generally, the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	At December 31, 2017 , our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.04 billion .
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S4	Unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale resulting from increases in interest rates therefore could have a temporary adverse effect on stockholders equity.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	We are also subject to other financial risks related to interest rate movements.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	Changes in interest rates can affect the average lives of loans and mortgage related securities.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Increases in interest rates can result in extending the average lives of our loans and mortgage related securities, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available to invest in higher-yielding assets.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Decreases in interest rates can result in the prepayment or refinancing of loans and loans underlying mortgage related securities, resulting in accelerated cash flows subject to reinvestment at reduced market interest rates and increased premium amortization.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	We are subject to liquidity risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including loan originations and commitments, withdrawals by depositors, repayments of borrowings, operating expenses and capital expenditures.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Liquidity is derived primarily from deposit growth and retention; principal and interest payments, sales, maturities, and prepayments of loans and investment securities; net cash provided from operations; and access to other funding sources.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors specific to us or the financial services industry in general.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	Factors detrimental to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn, lack of competitiveness, or adverse regulatory action against us.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we rely on our loan quality reviews and credit risk ratings, loan portfolio trends, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board released an updated standard for determining credit losses, which fundamentally changes how financial institutions calculate their allowance reserves.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The new standard, which will become effective for reporting periods effective January 1, 2020, will require us to adopt a Current Expected Credit Loss model that measures projected credit losses over the estimated life of the asset.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	This approach is a significant departure from the current accounting standard, which estimates potential credit losses based on losses considered to be probable and reasonably estimable.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	When adopted, this new standard may increase our allowance for credit losses, which could materially affect our financial condition and future results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S4	The extent of the increase, if any, will ultimately depend upon the nature and characteristics of our loan portfolio at the adoption date, as well as the macroeconomic assumptions and forecasts used at that date.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P9_S5	Therefore, the potential financial impact is currently unknown.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	Our commercial real estate, multi-family, and commercial loans expose us to increased lending risks.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	A significant portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and, to a lesser extent, construction loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	These loans are generally regarded as having a higher risk of default and loss than single-family residential mortgage loans, because repayment of these loans often depends on the successful operation of a business or of the underlying property.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S3	In addition, our construction loans, multi-family loans, commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans have significantly larger average loan balances compared to our single-family residential mortgage loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S4	Also, many of our borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P10_S5	Consequently, any adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to one single-family residential mortgage loan.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	We may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, is likely to have both positive and negative effects on our financial performance.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	For example, the new legislation will result in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, which will have a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S3	However, the new legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S4	These limitations include (1) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (2) the elimination of interest deductions for certain home equity loans, (3) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, and (4) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P11_S5	As a result of the enactment of this legislation, the Company recognized an additional tax expense of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and the valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, like New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	If bank regulators impose limitations on our commercial real estate lending activities, earnings could be adversely affected.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The FDIC, the OCC and the FRB (collectively, the Agencies ) have issued joint guidance entitled Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the CRE Guidance ).
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank s commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans ( CRE Loans ), represent 300% or more of an institution s total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the CRE Loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	While our level of CRE Loans equaled 453% of total risk-based capital at December 31, 2017, our CRE Loan portfolio has not increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	In December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the 2015 Statement ).
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If our regulators were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our loan portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans held, our earnings or our ability to engage in certain merger and acquisition activity could be adversely affected.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our success is significantly affected by general economic conditions in northern and central New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Unlike some larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers mostly located in our primary markets.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Consequently, a downturn in economic conditions in our local markets would have a significant impact on our loan portfolios, the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations and the value of the collateral securing our loans.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S5	Adverse local economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P16_S6	Additionally, because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, depressed real estate values and real estate sales could also have a negative effect on the ability of many of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and overall financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	We target our business development and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses in northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	Risks associated with cyber-security could negatively affect our earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The financial services industry continues to experience increasing numbers of severe cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to systems and data, or obstructing access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have established policies, processes, and tools to limit the impact of cyber-attacks, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data and maintain operational resiliency may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Our customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S4	We have implemented safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S5	The occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, our chartering authority, and by the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the requirement for additional capital, the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, and our management of risks posed by our reliance on third party vendors.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S5	Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on our operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P21_S6	The potential exists for additional Federal or state laws and regulations regarding capital requirements, lending and funding practices and liquidity standards, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to remain active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the potential issuance of formal enforcement orders.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Actions taken to date, as well as potential actions, may not have the beneficial effects that are intended.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes could increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S2	New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S3	We will be subject to heightened regulatory requirements when we exceed total assets of $10 billion.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Provident's total assets were $9.85 billion at December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S5	Banks with assets in excess of $10 billion are subject to requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations including the examination authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assess our compliance with federal consumer financial laws, imposition of higher FDIC premiums, reduced debit card interchange fees, enhanced risk management frameworks and stress testing, all of which increase operating costs and reduce earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S6	As we approach $10 billion in assets, we are incurring additional costs to prepare for the implementation of these imposed requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S7	We may be required to invest more significant management attention and resources to evaluate and continue to make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S8	Further, federal financial regulators may require us to accelerate our actions and investments to prepare for compliance before we exceed $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and may suspend or delay certain regulatory actions, such as approving a merger agreement, if they deem our preparations to be inadequate.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S9	Upon reaching this threshold, we face the risk that we may fail to meet these requirements, which may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S10	While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S11	A general economic slowdown or uncertainty that produces either reduced returns or excessive market volatility could adversely impact our wealth management fee income.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S12	A general economic slowdown could affect the value of the assets under management in our wealth management business resulting in lower fee income.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S13	Furthermore, conditions that produce extended market volatility could affect our ability to provide our clients with an adequate return, thereby impacting our ability to attract new clients or causing existing clients to seek more stable investment opportunities with alternative wealth advisors.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S14	Strong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S15	Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense and expanding with entrants into our market providing new and innovative technology-driven financial solutions.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S16	Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P22_S17	We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, investment advisers, wealth managers, mutual funds, insurance companies, online lenders, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating both locally and elsewhere.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	In particular, over the past decade, our local markets have experienced the effects of substantial banking consolidation, and large out-of-state competitors have grown significantly.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do, and may offer certain deposit and loan pricing, services or credit criteria that we do not or cannot provide.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	There are also a number of strong locally-based competitors with large capital positions in our market who may deploy aggressive strategies to drive growth, take our customers and win market share.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Furthermore, key components of the financial services value chain have been replicated by digital innovation, commonly referred to as Fintech.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	The adoption of these Fintech solutions within our market area may cause greater and faster disruption to our business model if we are unable to keep pace with, or invest wisely in, these enabling technologies.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	We operate in diverse market segments and rely on the ability of our employees, systems and third party providers, who are used extensively in support of our operations, to process a high number of transactions.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, the occurrence of systems failures and disruptions, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S5	While we maintain a risk management program that is designed to minimize risk, we could suffer losses, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S6	Acts of terrorism and other external events could impact our ability to conduct business.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P24_S7	Our business is subject to risk from external events.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising their operating and communication systems.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The metropolitan New York and Philadelphia areas remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, which could affect not only our operations but those of our customers.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disrupt power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings could decline.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	We record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill and other intangible assets, at fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	At December 31, 2017 , goodwill totaling $411.6 million was not amortized but remains subject to impairment tests at least annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment tests if events or circumstances indicate a potential inability to realize the carrying amount.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	It is possible that our future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets, or both.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S5	If we determine impairment exists at a given point in time, our earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S6	In any event, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and other identified intangible assets have no impact on our tangible book value or regulatory capital levels.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P27_S7	A State Bank in New Jersey could be disruptive to our overall strategies and potentially reduce the level of public funds held on deposit with us.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We maintain a large and relatively stable level of deposits from local government entities, primarily through relationships we have cultivated with New Jersey municipalities.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	These moneys are a relatively low-cost source used to fund our loans and investments.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The State of New Jersey is considering creating a State Bank, whose purpose would be to promote small businesses, fair educational lending, housing, infrastructure improvements, community development, economic development, commerce, and industry in the State.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P29_S1	As currently proposed, it intends to permit State funds, including funds from State institutions and any State public source, to be held by the State Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P29_S2	There can be no assurance that legislation to create a State Bank will pass or whether it will pass as currently proposed.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Given the degree of our funding reliance on many New Jersey-based public entities and the potential scope of the proposed State Bank s lending activities, we are uncertain of the impact this proposal may have on us.
1178970_18_ITEM1A_P29_S4	If we are unable to retain the current level of public funds on deposit, we may need to increase the costs associated with our funding needs, which could have a negative impact on our net income.
1178970_18_ITEM1B_P0_S0	There are no unresolved comments from the staff of the SEC to report.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Property At December 31, 2017 , the Bank conducted business through 84 full-service branch offices located in Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren counties in New Jersey, and in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Bank maintains satellite loan production offices in Convent Station, Flemington, Paramus and Princeton, New Jersey, as well as in Bethlehem, Newtown and Wayne, Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	The aggregate net book value of premises and equipment was $63.2 million at December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	On December 13, 2017, the Company completed the sale and leaseback of 12 of its New Jersey banking offices, which had a net book value of $14.5 million.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S4	Net proceeds from the sale totaled $20.7 million.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P0_S5	The transaction did not have a significant immediate impact on the Company s financial statements as the resultant net gain on sale will be recognized over the 10 year term of the leases as a reduction of rent expense.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	The Company s executive offices are located in a leased facility at 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey, which is also the Bank s Main Office.
1178970_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Bank s administrative offices are located in a leased facility at 100 Wood Avenue South, Iselin, New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Company is involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of its business.
1178970_18_ITEM3_P0_S1	In the opinion of management, these legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Company s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the symbol PFS.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	Trading in the Company s common stock commenced on January 16, 2003.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	As of February 1, 2018, there were 83,209,293 shares of the Company s common stock issued and 66,842,531 shares outstanding, and approximately 4,935 stockholders of record.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	The table below shows the high and low closing prices reported on the NYSE for the Company s common stock, as well as the cash dividends paid per common share during the periods indicated.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	The $0.35 cash dividend paid per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $0.15 special cash dividend declared by the Board of Directors on November 16, 2017 and paid on December 22, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	On January 26, 2018 , the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share, which was paid on February 28, 2018, to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 15, 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S2	The Company s Board of Directors intends to review the payment of dividends quarterly and plans to continue to maintain a regular quarterly cash dividend in the future, subject to financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, industry standards, economic conditions, regulatory restrictions that affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and other relevant factors.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S3	The Company is subject to the requirements of Delaware law that generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the difference between the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities and the amount equal to the aggregate par value of the outstanding shares of capital stock.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S4	If there is no difference between these amounts, dividends are limited to net income for the current and/or immediately preceding year.
1178970_18_ITEM5_P1_S5	In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if: (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.

1178970_18_ITEM7_P0_S0	General On January 15, 2003, the Company became the holding company for the Bank, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P1_S0	The Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock in a subscription offering to eligible depositors.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P1_S1	Concurrent with the conversion, the Company contributed an additional 1,920,000 shares of its common stock and $4.8 million in cash to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company conducts business through its subsidiary, the Bank, a community- and customer-oriented bank currently operating full-service branches and loan production offices throughout northern and central New Jersey, as well as Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	Strategy Established in 1839, the Bank is the oldest New Jersey-chartered bank in the state.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	The Bank offers a full range of retail and commercial loan and deposit products, and emphasizes personal service and convenience.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S3	The Bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring, retaining and expanding customer relationships, while carefully managing interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S4	In recent years, the Bank has focused on commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P2_S5	These types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	At December 31, 2017 , these commercial loan types accounted for 77.9% of the loan portfolio and retail loans accounted for 22.1% .
1178970_18_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company intends to continue to focus on commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial lending relationships.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company s relationship banking strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network, mobile banking, online banking and telephone banking touch points.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company continues to evaluate opportunities to increase market share by expanding within existing and contiguous markets.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	Core deposits, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, are generally a stable, relatively inexpensive source of funds.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	At December 31, 2017 , core deposits were 90.5% of total deposits.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income, the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income to the extent the Company s interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature at different times or relative interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	An increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the Company s average interest rate spread and net interest income, which could have a negative effect on profitability.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	The Company generates non-interest income such as income from retail and business account fees, loan servicing fees, loan origination fees, loan level swap fees, appreciation in the cash surrender value of Bank-owned life insurance, income from loan or securities sales, fees from wealth management services and investment product sales and other fees.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Company s operating expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits expense, occupancy and equipment expense, data processing expense, the amortization of intangible assets, marketing and advertising expense and other general and administrative expenses.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, changes in asset quality, changes in asset values, actions of regulatory agencies and government policies.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The Company considers certain accounting policies to be critically important to the fair presentation of its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P8_S1	These policies require management to make complex judgments on matters which by their nature have elements of uncertainty.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P8_S2	The sensitivity of the Company s consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies, and the assumptions and estimates applied, could have a significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P8_S3	These assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management can be influenced by a number of factors, including the general economic environment.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P8_S4	The Company has identified the following as critical accounting policies:
1178970_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	Valuation of deferred tax assets The calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the Company.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P10_S2	Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P10_S3	Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P10_S4	Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency status.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	For commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S3	Loans deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S5	Commercial mortgage, multi-family, construction and commercial loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and the Credit Department.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party, and periodically by the Credit Committee in the credit renewal or approval process.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P12_S8	In addition, the Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk rating.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P13_S1	Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look-back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P13_S2	Quantitative loss factors are evaluated at least annually.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P13_S3	Management completed its annual evaluation of the quantitative loss factors for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P14_S1	Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look-back period.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P14_S2	Qualitative adjustments are evaluated at least quarterly.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P14_S3	The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a general decline in the economy, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of elevated unemployment, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P15_S1	Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P15_S2	Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P15_S3	Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P15_S4	Although management believes that the Company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels, additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing and commercial real estate markets and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P17_S1	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P17_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P17_S3	Such agencies may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P17_S4	Although management uses the best information available, the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short-term change.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P18_S1	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P19_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P20_S3	If either exists, the entire decline in value is considered other-than-temporary and would be recognized as an expense in the current period.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P20_S4	In its evaluations, the Company did not recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge on securities for the years ended 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities and estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	A valuation allowance is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company did not require a valuation allowance at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Analysis of Net Interest Income Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	Net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the rates of interest earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P23_S2	The following table sets forth certain information for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1178970_18_ITEM7_P23_S3	For the periods indicated, the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resultant yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities is expressed both in dollars and rates.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P23_S4	No tax equivalent adjustments were made.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	(1) Average outstanding balance amounts are at amortized cost.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	(2) Average outstanding balances are net of the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan fees and expenses, and loan premiums and discounts and include non-accrual loans.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P24_S2	(3) Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	The following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate); (ii) changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume); and (iii) the net change.
1178970_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate.

1178970_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The guidelines of the Company s interest rate risk policy seek to limit the exposure to changes in interest rates that affect the underlying economic value of assets and liabilities, earnings and capital.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	To minimize interest rate risk, the Company generally sells all 20- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans at origination.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P0_S3	Commercial real estate loans generally have interest rates that reset in five years, and other commercial loans such as construction loans and commercial lines of credit reset with changes in the Prime rate, the Federal Funds rate or LIBOR.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P0_S4	Investment securities purchases generally have maturities of five years or less, and mortgage-backed securities have weighted average lives between three and five years.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Asset/Liability Committee meets on at least a monthly basis to review the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net interest margin, net income and the economic value of equity.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The Asset/Liability Committee reviews a variety of strategies that project changes in asset or liability mix and the impact of those changes on projected net interest income and net income.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Company s strategy for liabilities has been to maintain a stable core-funding base by focusing on core deposit account acquisition and increasing products and services per household.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were 9.5% at December 31, 2017 , compared to 9.9% at December 31, 2016 .

1178970_18_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The Company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon current funding needs and the ability of the Company to fund operations through alternative sources, primarily by accessing short-term lines of credit with the FHLBNY during periods of pricing dislocation.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Current and future sensitivity to changes in interest rates are measured through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The analysis captures changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base, a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	Changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period, generally twelve to twenty-four months, are measured and compared to policy limits for acceptable change.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	simulation model regarding the interest rate sensitivity of deposits without maturity dates.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	These modifications are made to more closely reflect the most likely results under the various interest rate change scenarios.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	Since it is inherently difficult to predict the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates, the changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates cannot be precisely predicted.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	There are a variety of reasons that may cause actual results to vary considerably from the predictions presented below which include, but are not limited to, the timing, magnitude, and frequency of changes in interest rates, interest rate spreads, prepayments, and actions taken in response to such changes.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P6_S2	Specific assumptions used in the simulation model include:
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Higher-balance demand deposit tiers and promotional demand accounts move at 50% to 75% of the rate ramp in either direction.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The above table indicates that as of December 31, 2017 , in the event of a 300 basis point increase in interest rates, whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 3.8% , or $11.2 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P9_S1	In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, whereby rates ramp down evenly over a twelve-month period, the Company would experience a 0.6% , or $1.7 million decrease in net interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The preceding table indicates that as of December 31, 2017 , in the event of an immediate and sustained 300 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 13.1% , or $191.0 million reduction in the present value of equity.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 1.9% , or $27.3 million decrease in the present value of equity.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P12_S1	Modeling changes in net interest income requires the use of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P13_S1	Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM7A_P13_S2	Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the Company s net interest income and will differ from actual results.

1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S2	Such estimates are used in connection with the determination of the allowance for loan losses, evaluation of goodwill for impairment, evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment on securities, evaluation of the need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and determination of liabilities related to retirement and other post-retirement benefits, among others.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S3	These estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S4	Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S5	Such estimates and assumptions are adjusted when facts and circumstances dictate.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S6	Illiquid credit markets, volatile securities markets, and declines in the housing market and the economy generally have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S7	As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P12_S8	Changes in estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, Federal funds sold and commercial paper with original maturity dates less than 90 days.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	Securities Securities include investment securities held to maturity and securities available for sale.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P14_S1	The available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in Stockholders Equity.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P14_S2	Estimated fair values are based on market quotations or matrix pricing.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	Securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P15_S1	Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other-than-temporary.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P15_S2	In this evaluation, if such a decline were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P15_S3	The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P16_S2	The Company determines if it has the intent to sell these securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P16_S3	If either exists, the entire decline in value is considered other-than-temporary and would be recognized as an expense in the current period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized and accreted to income using a method that approximates the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for anticipated prepayments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Realized gains and losses are recognized when securities are sold or called based on the specific identification method.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock The Bank, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLBNY ), is required to hold shares of capital stock of the FHLBNY at cost based on a specified formula.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Bank carries this investment at cost, which approximates fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P21_S2	Loans Loans receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances plus unamortized premiums, purchase accounting mark-to-market adjustments, certain deferred direct loan origination costs and deferred loan origination fees and discounts, less the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S0	The Bank defers loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs and accretes such amounts as an adjustment to the yield over the expected lives of the related loans using the interest method.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S1	Premiums and discounts on loans purchased are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments when applicable, using methodologies which approximate the interest method.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S2	Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to contractual obligations or when other circumstances indicate that collection is questionable.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S3	When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S4	Payments received on a non-accrual loan are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on an assessment of the ability to collect the loan.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P22_S5	A non-accrual loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments become less than 90 days past due and its future collectability is reasonably assured.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	An impaired loan is defined as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P23_S1	Impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that each loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P23_S2	Residential mortgage and consumer loans are deemed smaller balance homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment and are therefore excluded from the population of impaired loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	Purchased Credit-Impaired ( PCI ) loans, are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, with no allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the fair value of the PCI loans at acquisition represents the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P24_S3	Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition represent the non-accretable discount and are not recognized as a yield adjustment or a valuation allowance.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P24_S4	Reclassifications of the non-accretable to accretable yield may occur subsequent to the loan acquisition dates due to an increase in expected cash flows of the loans and results in an increase in interest income on a prospective basis.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Allowance for Loan Losses Losses on loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P25_S1	Additions to this allowance are made by recoveries of loans previously charged off and by a provision charged to expense.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	The determination of the balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on an analysis of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, historical loan loss experience and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions in the Bank s market area.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P26_S2	In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Bank s allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	require the Bank to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write-downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance at the time of foreclosure or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	Fair value is generally based on recent appraisals.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P28_S2	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated costs to sell, is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	Banking Premises and Equipment Land is carried at cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P30_S2	Banking premises, furniture, fixtures and equipment are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation, computed using the straight-line method based on their estimated useful lives (generally 25 to 40 years for buildings, and 3 to 5 years for furniture and equipment).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P30_S3	Leasehold improvements, carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the assets, whichever are shorter, using the straight-line method.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P30_S4	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	Income Taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S5	The determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P31_S6	Such estimates are subject to management s judgment.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	A valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	Trust Assets Trust assets consisting of securities and other property (other than cash on deposit held by the Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for customers of the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Beacon Trust Company) are not included in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition because such properties are not assets of the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S1	Intangible Assets Intangible assets of the Bank consist of goodwill, core deposit premiums, customer relationship premium and mortgage servicing rights.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S2	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired through purchase acquisitions.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S3	In accordance with GAAP, goodwill with an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual measurement dates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S4	Goodwill is analyzed for impairment each year at September 30th.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S5	As permitted by GAAP, the Company prepares a qualitative assessment in determining whether goodwill may be impaired.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S6	The factors considered in the assessment include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions and overall financial performance of the Company, among others.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S7	The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P34_S8	Based upon its qualitative assessment of goodwill, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired and no further quantitative analysis was warranted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Core deposit premiums represent the intangible value of depositor relationships assumed in purchase acquisitions and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 8.8 years.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Customer relationship premiums represent the intangible value of customer relationships assumed in the purchase acquisition of Beacon and MDE, and are amortized on an accelerated basis over 12.0 years and 10.4 years, respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Mortgage servicing rights are recorded when purchased or when originated mortgage loans are sold, with servicing rights retained.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	Mortgage servicing rights are amortized on an accelerated method based upon the estimated lives of the related loans, adjusted for prepayments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	Bank-owned Life Insurance Bank-owned life insurance is accounted for using the cash surrender value method and is recorded at its realizable value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Employee Benefit Plans The Bank maintains a pension plan which covers full-time employees hired prior to April 1, 2003, the date on which the pension plan was frozen.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Bank s policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P38_S2	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status at the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Bank has a 401(k) plan covering substantially all employees of the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Bank may match a percentage of the first 6% contributed by participants.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P39_S2	The Bank s matching contribution, if any, is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	The Bank has an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	The funds borrowed by the ESOP from the Company to purchase the Company s common stock are being repaid from the Bank s contributions and dividends paid on unallocated ESOP shares over a period of up to 30 years.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P40_S2	The Company s common stock not allocated to participants is recorded as a reduction of stockholders equity at cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P40_S3	Compensation expense for the ESOP is based on the average price of the Company s stock during each quarter and the amount of shares allocated during the quarter.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Bank has an Equity Plan designed to provide competitive compensation for demonstrated performance and to align the interests of participants directly to increases in shareholder value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Equity Plan provides for performance-vesting grants as well as time-vesting grants.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	Time-vesting stock awards, stock options and performance vesting stock awards that are based on a performance condition, such as return on average assets are valued on the closing stock price on the date of grant.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	Performance vesting stock awards and options that are based on a market condition, such as Total Shareholder Return, would be valued using a generally accepted statistical technique to simulate future stock prices for Provident and the components of the Peer Group which Provident would be measured against.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Expense related to time vesting stock awards and stock options is based on the fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant and on the fair value of the stock options on the date of the grant, respectively, and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the awards.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	Performance vesting stock awards and stock options are either dependent upon a market condition or a performance condition.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	A market condition performance metric is tied to a stock price, either on an absolute basis, or a relative basis against peers, while a performance-condition is based on internal operations, such as earnings per share.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	The expense related to a market condition performance-vesting stock award or stock option requires an initial Monte Carlo simulation to determine grant date fair value, which will be recognized as a compensation expense regardless of actual payout, assuming that the executive is still employed at the end of the requisite service period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S3	If pre-vesting termination (forfeiture) occurs, then any expense recognized to date can be reversed.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S4	The grant date fair value is recognized ratably over the performance period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P43_S5	The expense related to a performance condition stock award or stock option is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted periodically based upon the number of awards or options expected to be earned, recognized over the performance period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	In connection with the First Sentinel acquisition in July 2004, the Company assumed the First Savings Bank Directors Deferred Fee Plan (the DDFP ).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	The DDFP was frozen prior to the acquisition.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P44_S2	The Company recorded a deferred compensation equity instrument and corresponding contra-equity account for the value of the shares held by the DDFP at the July 14, 2004 acquisition date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P44_S3	These accounts will be liquidated as shares are distributed from the DDFP in accordance with the plan document.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P44_S4	At December 31, 2017 , there were 296,049 shares held by the DDFP.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Bank maintains a non-qualified plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain executives who are prevented from receiving the full benefits contemplated by the 401(k) Plan s and the ESOP s benefit formulas under tax law limits for tax-qualified plans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Bank provides post-retirement health care and life insurance plans to certain of its employees.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The life insurance coverage is noncontributory to the participant.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	length of service with the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	The costs of such benefits are accrued based on actuarial assumptions from the date of hire to the date the employee is fully eligible to receive the benefits.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	On December 31, 2002, the Bank eliminated postretirement healthcare benefits for employees with less than 10 years of service.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	GAAP requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation; (b) measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	These interest rate derivatives result from a service provided to certain qualifying borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	As such, all changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S4	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S5	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P51_S6	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analyses using observable market-based inputs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income is divided into net income and other comprehensive income (loss).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items previously recorded directly to equity, such as unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and amortization related to post-retirement obligations.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P53_S2	Comprehensive income is presented in a separate Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Segment Reporting The Company s operations are solely in the financial services industry and include providing traditional banking and other financial services to its customers.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company operates primarily in the geographical regions of northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Management makes operating decisions and assesses performance based on an ongoing review of the Bank s consolidated financial results.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Therefore, the Company has a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock (such as stock options) were exercised or resulted in the issuance of common stock.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	These potentially dilutive shares would then be included in the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Shares issued and shares reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they were outstanding.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2018-02, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income" to address a narrow-scope financial reporting issue that arose as a consequence of the change in the tax law.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	The ASU permits a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the newly enacted federal corporate income tax rate.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	The amount of the reclassification would be the difference between the historical corporate income tax rate of 35 percent and the newly enacted 21 percent corporate income tax rate.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	ASU 2018-02 is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted, including adoption in any interim period, for (i) public business entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (ii) all other entities for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The changes are required to be applied retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is recognized.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, which resulted in the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings totaling $1.4 million , reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The purpose of this updated guidance is to better align a company s financial reporting for hedging activities with the economic objectives of those activities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	ASU 2017-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption, including adoption in an interim period, permitted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	ASU 2017-12 requires a modified retrospective transition method in which the Company will recognize the cumulative effect of the change on the opening balance of each affected component of equity in the statement of financial position as of the date of adoption.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	This update provides guidance about changes to terms or conditions of a share-based payment award which would require modification accounting.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P65_S2	In particular, an entity is required to account for the effects of a modification if the fair value, vesting condition or the equity/liability classification of the modified award is not the same immediately before and after a change to the terms and conditions of the award.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	ASU 2017-09 is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Company's adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	This ASU shortens the amortization period for premiums on callable debt securities by requiring that premiums be amortized to the first (or earliest) call date instead of as an adjustment to the yield over the contractual life.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	This change more closely aligns the accounting with the economics of a callable debt security and the amortization period with expectations that already are included in market pricing on callable debt securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P67_S3	This ASU does not change the accounting for discounts on callable debt securities, which will continue to be amortized to the maturity date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	This guidance includes only instruments that are held at a premium and have explicit call features.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S1	It does not include instruments that contain prepayment features, such as mortgage backed securities; nor does it include call options that are contingent upon future events or in which the timing or amount to be paid is not fixed.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S2	The effective date for this ASU is fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within the reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S3	Transition is on a modified retrospective basis with an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S4	If early adopted in an interim period, adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P68_S5	The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, "Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost", which requires that companies disaggregate the service cost component from other components of net benefit cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	This update calls for companies that offer post-retirement benefits to present the service cost, which is the amount an employer has to set aside each quarter or fiscal year to cover the benefits, in the same line item with other current employee compensation costs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	Other components of net benefit cost will be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside the subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	The Company's adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, or disclosures.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	The main objective of this ASU is to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring that impairment charges be based upon the first step in the current two-step impairment test under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount (Step 2).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit from the reporting unit s fair value as determined in Step 1.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	To determine the implied fair value of goodwill, entities estimate the fair value of any unrecognized intangible assets and any corporate-level assets or liabilities that were included in the determination of the carrying amount and fair value of the reporting unit in Step 1.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	Under ASU 2017-04, if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S3	The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S4	This standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S5	ASU 2017-04 does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S6	Under ASU 2017-04, an entity will still be able to perform the current optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to Step 1.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S7	The standard will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in periods beginning after December 15, 2019.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S8	Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after January 1, 2017.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P73_S9	The Company does not expect ASU 2017-04 to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments," a new standard which addresses diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (including bank-owned life insurance policies), distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	Entities will apply the standard s provisions using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P74_S4	The Company's adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments by a reporting entity at each reporting date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	The amendments in this ASU require financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	The allowance for credit losses would represent a valuation account that would be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S4	The income statement would reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S5	The measurement of expected credit losses would be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S6	An entity will be required to use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S7	The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2019.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S8	Early adoption of this ASU is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S9	The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S10	In that regard, the Company has formed a cross-functional working group, under the direction of the Chief Credit Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S11	The working group is comprised of individuals from various functional areas including credit, risk management, finance and information technology, among others.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S12	The Company is currently developing an implementation plan to include assessment of processes, portfolio segmentation, model development, system requirements and the identification of data and resource needs, among other things.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P75_S13	Also, the Company is currently evaluating third-party vendor solutions to assist us in the application of the ASU 2016-13.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	The adoption of the ASU 2016-13 may result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an "incurred loss" model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an "expected loss" model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	Furthermore, ASU 2016-13 will necessitate establishing an allowance for expected credit losses on debt securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	The Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13, it is expected that the impact of adoption will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan and securities portfolios as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts as of the adoption date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P77_S2	Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P77_S3	The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	modified retrospective approach must be applied for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	This amendment supersedes the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories, requires equity securities, except equity method investments, to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income, and simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	The amendment requires public business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet to measure that fair value using the exit price notion.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	The amendment requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S4	The amendment requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S5	The amendment reduces diversity in current practice by clarifying that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available for sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S6	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S7	Entities should apply the amendment by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, with the exception of the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P80_S8	The Company's adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	The objective of this amendment is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	This update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are in the scope of other standards.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P81_S3	Subsequently, the FASB issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations; ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing; ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting; and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P81_S4	These amendments are intended to improve and clarify the implementation guidance of ASU 2014-09 and have the same effective date as the original standard.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	The Company's revenue is comprised of net interest income on interest earning assets and liabilities and non-interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	The scope of guidance explicitly excludes net interest income as well as other revenues associated with financial assets and liabilities, including loans, leases, securities and derivatives.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S2	Accordingly, the majority of the Company's revenues will not be affected.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S3	The Company formed a working group to guide implementation efforts including the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance, as well as the evaluation of revenue contracts and the respective performance obligations within those contracts.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S4	The Company has completed its evaluation of this guidance and concluded that there are no material changes related to the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S5	The Company will disaggregate significant categories of revenue within the scope of the guidance and provide the required disclosures starting in the first quarter of 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P82_S6	The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	On January 15, 2003, the Bank completed its plan of conversion, and the Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

1178970_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Upon completion of the plan of conversion, a liquidation account was established in an amount equal to the total equity of the Bank as of the latest practicable date prior to the conversion.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	The liquidation account was established to provide a limited priority claim to the assets of the Bank to eligible account holders and supplemental eligible account holders as defined in the Plan, who continue to maintain deposits in the Bank after the conversion.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the Bank, and only in such event, each eligible account holder and supplemental eligible account holder would receive a liquidation distribution, prior to any payment to the holder of the Bank s common stock.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P85_S3	This distribution would be based upon each eligible account holder s and supplemental eligible account holder s proportionate share of the then total remaining qualifying deposits.

1178970_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	(6) Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized over the lives of the loans as an adjustment to yield.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	Required reductions due to loan prepayments are charged against interest income.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , $1.0 million , $1.3 million and $1.1 million decreased interest income, respectively, as a result of prepayments and normal amortization.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P100_S3	The following table summarizes the aging of loans receivable by portfolio segment and class of loans, excluding PCI loans (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Included in loans receivable are loans for which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued due to deterioration in the financial condition of the borrowers.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The principal amount of these nonaccrual loans was $34.9 million and $42.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1.9 million , $2.2 million and $1.2 million , for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 was $1.8 million , $1.5 million and $1.9 million respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Company defines an impaired loan as a non-homogeneous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P102_S2	A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a loan modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower s financial difficulty.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P102_S3	Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, unless modified as TDRs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company separately calculates the reserve for loan loss on impaired loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Company may recognize impairment of a loan based upon: (1) the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate; or (2) if a loan is collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral; or (3) the market price of the loan.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P103_S2	Additionally, if impaired loans have risk characteristics in common, those loans may be aggregated and historical statistics may be used as a means of measuring those impaired loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company uses third-party appraisals to determine the fair value of the underlying collateral in its analysis of collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	A third-party appraisal is generally ordered as soon as a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and updated annually, or more frequently if required.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	A specific allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for each impaired loan with a carrying balance greater than the collateral s fair value, less estimated costs to sell.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	Charge-offs are generally taken for the amount of the specific allocation when operations associated with the respective property cease and it is determined that collection of amounts due will be derived primarily from the disposition of the collateral.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	At each fiscal quarter end, if a loan is designated as a collateral dependent impaired loan and the third party appraisal has not yet been received, an evaluation of all available collateral is made using the best information available at the time, including rent rolls, borrower financial statements and tax returns, prior appraisals, management s knowledge of the market and collateral, and internally prepared collateral valuations based upon market assumptions regarding vacancy and capitalization rates, each as and where applicable.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	Once the appraisal is received and reviewed, the specific reserves are adjusted to reflect the appraised value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P106_S1	The Company believes there have been no significant time lapses as a result of this process.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	At December 31, 2017 , there were 149 impaired loans totaling $52.0 million , of which 141 loans totaling $41.7 million were TDRs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	Included in this total were 125 TDRs related to 121 borrowers totaling $31.7 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	At December 31, 2016 , there were 141 impaired loans totaling $52.0 million , of which 136 loans totaling $41.6 million were TDRs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P107_S3	Included in this total were 114 TDRs related to 110 borrowers totaling $29.9 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	Loans receivable summarized by portfolio segment and impairment method, excluding PCI loans are as follows (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	The allowance for loan losses is summarized by portfolio segment and impairment classification, excluding PCI loans as follows (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties that are considered TDRs primarily involve lowering the monthly payments on such loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	These modifications generally do not result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P110_S2	In addition, the Company attempts to obtain additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms and our underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following tables present the number of loans modified as TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and their balances immediately prior to the modification date and post-modification as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	All TDRs are impaired loans, which are individually evaluated for impairment, as previously discussed.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	Estimated collateral values of collateral dependent impaired loans modified during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 exceeded the carrying amounts of such loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2017 , there were $5.1 million of charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S3	There were no charge-offs recorded on collateral dependent impaired loans for the same period last year.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S4	The allowance for loan losses associated with the TDRs presented in the preceding tables totaled $166,000 and $187,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively and were included in the allowance for loan losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S5	The TDRs presented in the preceding tables had a weighted average modified interest rate of approximately 4.18% and 5.25% , compared to a yield of 4.19% and 4.25% prior to modification for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S6	There were no loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months from both December 31, 2017 and 2016 , which had a payment default (90 days or more past due) during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P113_S7	TDRs that subsequently default are considered collateral dependent impaired loans and are evaluated for impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less expected selling costs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	PCI loans are loans acquired at a discount primarily due to deteriorated credit quality.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	These loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, with no related allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	At December 31, 2017 , PCI loans totaled $1.0 million , compared to $1.3 million at December 31, 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P114_S3	The $303,000 decrease from December 31, 2016 was largely due to the full repayment and greater than projected cash flows on certain PCI loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The following table summarizes the changes in the accretable yield for PCI loans for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

1178970_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	In the normal course of conducting its business, the Bank extends credit to meet the financing needs of its customers through commitments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	Commitments and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit (including loan commitments of $1.71 billion and $1.55 billion , at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and undisbursed home equity and personal credit lines of $270.9 million and $279.8 million , at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively) exist, which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	The Bank uses the same credit policies and collateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P122_S1	Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P122_S2	Since the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Bank grants residential real estate loans on single- and multi-family dwellings to borrowers primarily in New Jersey.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	Its borrowers abilities to repay their obligations are dependent upon various factors, including the borrowers income and net worth, cash flows generated by the underlying collateral, value of the underlying collateral, and priority of the Bank s lien on the property.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P124_S2	Such factors are dependent upon various economic conditions and individual circumstances beyond the Bank s control; the Bank is therefore subject to risk of loss.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P124_S3	The Bank believes that its lending policies and procedures adequately minimize the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Collateral and/or guarantees are required for virtually all loans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	The Company utilizes an internal nine-point risk rating system to summarize its loan portfolio into categories with similar risk characteristics.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	Loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S3	Loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S4	Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S5	Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in their portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S6	These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Department.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S7	The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third-party.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P125_S8	Reports by the independent third-party are presented directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	Loans receivable by credit quality risk rating indicator, excluding PCI loans are as follows (in thousands):

1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S0	The Company provides its actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring the benefit obligation.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S1	The most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period-end present value of the benefit obligations, and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S2	A lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense, while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S3	The discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow-yield curve model specific to the Company s pension and post-retirement plans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S4	The Company compares this rate to certain market indices, such as long-term treasury bonds, or the Citigroup pension liability indices, for reasonableness.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P150_S5	A discount rate of 3.50% was selected for the December 31, 2017 measurement date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P151_S0	Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P151_S1	A 1% change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have had the following effects on post-retirement benefits at December 31, 2017 (in thousands):

1178970_18_ITEM8_P154_S1	The expected return on pension plan assets is also impacted by the target allocation of assets, which is based on the Company s goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P155_S0	Management strives to have pension plan assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have a significant detrimental impact on the entire portfolio.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P155_S1	The target allocation of assets and acceptable ranges around the targets are as follows:

1178970_18_ITEM8_P191_S2	In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P191_S3	The capital conservation buffer requirement was effective on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P191_S4	The capital conservation buffer during the calendar year 2017 was 1.25% and increased to 1.875% on January 1, 2018.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	Under its prompt corrective action regulations, the FDIC is required to take certain supervisory actions (and may take additional discretionary actions) with respect to an undercapitalized institution.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	Such actions could have a direct material effect on an institution s financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	The regulations establish a framework for the classification of savings institutions into five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P193_S1	Generally, an institution is considered well capitalized if it has: a leverage (Tier 1) capital ratio of at least 5.00% ; a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.50% ; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.00% ; and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00% .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	The foregoing capital ratios are based in part on specific quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P194_S1	Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the FDIC about capital components, risk weightings and other factors.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P194_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Bank exceeded all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P194_S3	Further, the most recent FDIC notification categorized the Bank as a well-capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action regulations.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P194_S4	There have been no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank s capital classification.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	The FRB has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis substantially similar to those of the FDIC for the Bank.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P195_S2	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company was well capitalized under FRB guidelines.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	Regulations of the FRB provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P196_S1	Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P196_S2	If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the FRB.

1178970_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P199_S1	The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P199_S2	Where quoted market values in an active market are not readily available, the Company utilizes various valuation techniques to estimate fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P199_S3	Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P199_S4	However, in many instances fair value estimates may not be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and may not be realized in an immediate sale of the financial instrument.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P200_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	Level 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	A financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	The valuation techniques are based upon the unpaid principal balance only, and exclude any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	Interest income and expense and dividend income are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to measure fair value of financial instruments in the table below on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	Securities Available for Sale For securities available for sale, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third-party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P206_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or to comparable securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs a quarterly analysis of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in an adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P207_S6	The Company also may hold equity securities and debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government-sponsored agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 inputs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	Derivatives The Company records all derivatives on the statements of financial condition at fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	The Company has interest rate derivatives resulting from a service provided to certain qualified borrowers in a loan related transaction and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S1	As such, all changes in fair value of the Company s derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S2	The Company also uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S3	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, and which satisfy hedge accounting requirements, involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S4	These derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with FHLBNY borrowings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S5	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P209_S6	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	The fair value of the Company's derivatives are determined using discounted cash flow analysis using observable market-based inputs, which are considered Level 2 inputs.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	The valuation techniques described below were used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured on a non-recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P211_S1	Collateral Dependent Impaired Loans For loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P211_S2	The Company measures the fair value of collateral underlying impaired loans primarily through obtaining independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	adjustments for estimated costs to sell between 5% and 10% .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company classifies these loans as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure are carried at fair value, less estimated costs, which range between 5% and 10% .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	Fair value is generally based on independent appraisals that rely upon quoted market prices for similar assets in active markets.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P213_S2	These appraisals include adjustments, on an individual case basis, to comparable assets based on the appraisers market knowledge and experience, and are classified as Level 3.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value less estimated selling costs is charged to the allowance for loan losses.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	A reserve for foreclosed assets may be established to provide for possible write-downs and selling costs that occur subsequent to foreclosure.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P214_S2	Foreclosed assets are carried net of the related reserve.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	Operating results from real estate owned, including rental income, operating expenses, and gains and losses realized from the sales of real estate owned, are recorded as incurred.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	There were no changes to the valuation techniques for fair value measurements during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The following tables present the assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	Other Fair Value Disclosures The Company is required to disclose estimated fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities on and off the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P218_S1	The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents For cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term investments, the carrying amount approximates fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	Investment Securities Held to Maturity For investment securities held to maturity, fair value was estimated using a market approach.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	The majority of the Company s securities are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P221_S1	Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party data service providers or dealer market participants with which the Company has historically transacted both purchases and sales of securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P221_S2	Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	Matrix pricing, a Level 2 input, is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S1	The Company evaluates the quality of Level 2 matrix pricing through comparison to similar assets with greater liquidity and evaluation of projected cash flows.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S2	As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analysis of the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S3	Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to a secondary pricing source.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S4	Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S5	The Company s internal price verification procedures and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services has not historically resulted in adjustment in the prices obtained from the pricing service.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P222_S6	The Company also holds debt instruments issued by the U.S. government and U.S. government agencies that are traded in active markets with readily accessible quoted market prices that are considered Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	The carrying value of FHLBNY stock was its cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P223_S1	The fair value of FHLBNY stock is based on redemption at par value.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P223_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P224_S0	Loans Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P224_S1	Loans are segregated by type such as commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, commercial, construction and consumer.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P224_S2	Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and into performing and non-performing categories.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P224_S3	The fair value of performing loans was estimated using a combination of techniques, including a discounted cash flow model that utilizes a discount rate that reflects the Company s current pricing for loans with similar characteristics and remaining maturity, adjusted by an amount for estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P224_S4	The rates take into account the expected yield curve, as well as an adjustment for prepayment risk, when applicable.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S1	The fair value for significant non-performing loans was based on recent external appraisals of collateral securing such loans, adjusted for the timing of anticipated cash flows.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S2	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its non-performing loan portfolio as Level 3.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S3	Deposits The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing demand deposits and savings deposits, was equal to the amount payable on demand and classified as Level 1.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S4	The estimated fair value of certificates of deposit was based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P225_S5	The discount rate was estimated using the Company s current rates offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company classifies the estimated fair value of its certificates of deposit portfolio as Level 2.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P226_S1	The fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates available for debt with similar terms and maturities and is classified by the Company as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P226_S2	The fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit was estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P227_S0	For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P227_S1	The fair value estimates of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are deemed immaterial.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P227_S2	Limitations Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P227_S3	These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P228_S1	These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P228_S2	Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	Fair value estimates are based on existing on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P229_S1	Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include goodwill and other intangibles, deferred tax assets and premises and equipment.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P229_S2	In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P230_S0	The following tables present the Company s financial instruments at their carrying and fair values as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P230_S1	Fair values are presented by level within the fair value hierarchy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	The following tables are a summary of certain quarterly financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	The following is a reconciliation of the outstanding shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P233_S0	Anti-dilutive stock options and awards totaling 369,772 shares, 432,895 shares and 469,018 shares at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, were excluded from the earnings per share calculations.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	(20) Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income The following table presents the components of other comprehensive (loss) income both gross and net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	The Company, in accordance with ASU No. 2018-02, has elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to retained earning for the year ended December 31, 2017 The following table presents the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , including the reclassification of income tax effects due to the adoption of ASU No. 2018-02 for the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P236_S0	The following table summarizes the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):
1178970_18_ITEM8_P237_S0	(1) This item is included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S0	The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S1	The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S2	The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S3	Derivatives not designated in qualifying hedging relationships are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain qualified commercial borrowers in loan related transactions and, therefore, are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company s assets or liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S4	The Company executes interest rate swaps with qualified commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P238_S5	Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P239_S0	The interest rate swap agreement which the Company executes with the commercial borrower is collateralized by the borrower's commercial real estate financed by the Company.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P239_S1	The collateral exceeds the maximum potential amount of future payments under the credit derivative.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P239_S2	As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P240_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Company had 50 and 36 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $734.3 million and $582.2 million , respectively, related to this program.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P240_S1	The Company has credit derivatives resulting from participations in interest rate swaps provided to external lenders as part of loan participation arrangements; therefore, they are not used to manage interest rate risk in the Company's assets or liabilities.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P240_S2	Cash flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P240_S3	The Company s objective in using interest rate derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P240_S4	To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P241_S0	Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P241_S1	The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P241_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash outflows associated with Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P242_S0	The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P242_S1	The Company implemented this program during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P242_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015, the Company s did not record any hedge ineffectiveness.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P242_S3	Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company s debt.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P242_S4	During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $127,492 will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P243_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had two outstanding interest rate derivatives with a notional amount of $60.0 million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of interest rate risk.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P243_S1	The table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

1178970_18_ITEM8_P247_S0	Derivatives designated as a hedging instrument:
1178970_18_ITEM8_P248_S0	The tables below present the effect of the Company s derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 (in thousands).
1178970_18_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P249_S1	In addition, the Company has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well/adequately capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P249_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest, was $352,000 .
1178970_18_ITEM8_P249_S3	The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain of its derivative counterparties, and has posted collateral of $250,000 against its obligations under these agreements.
1178970_18_ITEM8_P249_S4	If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2017 , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Christopher Martin, the Company s Principal Executive Officer, and Thomas M. Lyons, the Company s Principal Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P0_S1	Based upon their evaluation, they each found that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Company s internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S2	The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S3	All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S4	Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P1_S5	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P2_S0	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P2_S1	In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Based on the assessment management believes that, as of December 31, 2017 , the Company s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Company s independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 .
1178970_18_ITEM9A_P2_S4	This report appears on page 55 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the last quarter of the year under report, there was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
