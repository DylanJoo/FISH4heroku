1085392_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, Macquarie-FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	As a result of the merger, Puget Energy is the direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	The following table presents the number of PSE customers as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	During 2010, PSE s billed retail and transportation revenue from electric utility operations were derived 52.9% from residential customers, 41.1% from commercial customers, 5.1% from industrial customers and 0.9% from other customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P7_S1	PSE s retail revenue from natural gas utility operations were derived 65.1% from residential customers, 30.2% from commercial customers, 3.3% from industrial customers and 1.4% from transportation customers in 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P7_S2	During this period, the largest customer accounted for approximately 1.7% of PSE s operating revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	PSE is affected by various seasonal weather patterns and therefore, utility revenue and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	Energy usage varies seasonally and monthly, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE experiences its highest retail energy sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P9_S2	Sales of electricity to wholesale customers also vary by quarter and year depending principally upon fundamental market factors and weather conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	PSE has a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	PSE also has a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism in retail electric rates to recover variations in electricity costs on a shared basis with customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	In the five-year period ended December 31, 2010, PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.3 billion and retirements were $362.7 million.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	In the same five-year period, PSE s gross natural gas utility plant additions were $880.6 million and retirements were $122.4 million and PSE s gross common utility plant additions were $277.6 million and retirements were $292.6 million.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P11_S2	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2010 was approximately $7.6 billion, which consisted of 46.0% distribution, 34.0% generation, 6.1% transmission and 13.9% general plant and other.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P11_S3	Gross natural gas utility plant at December 31, 2010 was approximately $2.8 billion, which consisted of 93.2% distribution and 6.8% general plant and other.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P11_S4	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2010 was approximately $427.2 million.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	At December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had no employees and PSE had approximately 2,800 full-time employees.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P12_S1	Approximately 1,230 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P12_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire September 30, 2013 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Puget Energy s and PSE s principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P15_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how Renewable Energy Credit ( REC) proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The order required REC proceeds to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P16_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P16_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company s RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Company s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE s approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	The petition is still pending approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Effective July 1, 2010, the Washington Commission approved a change in PSE s PTC tariff as PSE has not been able to utilize PTCs since 2007, due to insufficient taxable income caused primarily by bonus tax depreciation.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	The Washington Commission approved PSE suspending its PTC tariff, effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	This resulted in an overall increase in PSE s electric rates of 1.7%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	On September 22, 2010, a joint proposal and accounting petition was filed with the Washington Commission by PSE, Washington Commission Staff and Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities which addressed how to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addresses REC proceeds to be returned to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	On October 26, 2010, the Washington Commission issued an order granting the joint proposal and accounting petition.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S2	The order allows the Company to credit customers for REC revenue received and deferred through November 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S3	This credit will reduce rates by $27.7 million, or 2.5%, over five months beginning November 2010 through March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S4	RECs received after November 2009 will be retained by PSE and will be used to recapture the benefit of PTCs previously provided to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S5	Once these PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return, the customers will receive the benefit.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P20_S6	There is no impact to net income related to these items.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	On December 30, 2010, the Washington Commission approved revisions to PSE s PTC tariff, effective January 1, 2011, which changed the methodology by which PTCs are passed-through to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of PTCs, the PTCs will pass-through to customers following the year in which they are able to be utilized on PSE s tax return, rather than in the same year in which they are generated by qualifying wind powered facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	The rate schedule will pass-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million treasury grant in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	The Washington Commission order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the treasury grant on an annual basis and includes 23 months of treasury grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represents the month the treasury grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S4	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P21_S5	Since the tariff now addresses additional federal incentives, it has been renamed the Federal Incentive Tracker.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually, or $10.1 million.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	On October 1, 2010, PSE filed a natural gas tariff filing with the Washington Commission to implement changes to natural gas rates that would result in an overall increase in revenue of $24.4 million and a customer rate increase of 2.3%.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P23_S1	The parties agreed upon a settlement of $19.0 million with a recommended effective date of April 1, 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P23_S2	A Washington Commission order is expected in March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Washington Commission approved a PGA natural gas tariff filing to adjust the PGA rates, effective November 1, 2010 to recover expected natural gas costs from PSE s sales to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	This filing reflected decreases in forward market prices.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S2	On an average annual basis, the impact of these changes is a 3.1% decrease in natural gas rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S3	The PGA filing also reflects a decrease in the PGA deferred natural gas cost credit, which will result in a 5.0% increase in overall natural gas revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S4	Collectively, the increase is $18.3 million, or 1.9%.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P24_S5	This rate adjustment will have no impact on PSE s net income.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P25_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P25_S2	A change in PGA rates increases or decreases PSE s revenue, but does not impact the Company s net income as the increased or decreased revenue is offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	Average usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	At December 31, 2010, PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 5,318 megawatts (MW).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P29_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments that may include, but are not limited to, weather-related hedges.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	Net of 59 MW of capacity delivered to Canada pursuant to the provisions of a treaty between Canada and the United States and Canadian Entitlement Allocation agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Power received from other utilities and firm contracts are classified between hydroelectric and other producers based on the character of the utility system used to supply the power or, if the power is supplied from a particular resource, the character of that resource.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	Short-term wholesale purchases, net of resale, of 2,498,452 megawatt hours (MWh) and 2,527,433 MWh account for 3.4% and 7.0% of energy production, for 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	At December 31, 2010, PSE owns or controls the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 2,926 MW:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility, operated pursuant to 50-year license granted by the FERC in October 2008, will require net present value funds between $305.0 million to $325.0 million for capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs over 50 years in order to implement the license conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	The license provides protection and enhancements for fish and wildlife, water quality, recreation and cultural and historic resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility, operated pursuant to 40-year license granted by the FERC in June 2004, will require net present value funds between $240.0 million to $260.0 million for capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs over 40 years in order to implement the license conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	During 2010, approximately 19.2% of PSE s energy requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	As of December 31, 2010, PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	On February 3, 2006, PSE and Chelan entered into a new Power Sales Agreement and a related Transmission Agreement for 25.0% of the output of Chelan s Rocky Reach and Rock Island hydroelectric generating facilities, located on the mid-Columbia River, in exchange for PSE paying 25.0% of the operating costs of the facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	The agreements terminate in 2031 and provide that PSE will begin to receive power upon expiration of PSE s existing long-term contracts with Chelan for the Rocky Reach and Rock Island output (expiring in 2011 and 2012, respectively).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	PSE made a non-refundable capacity reservation payment of $89.0 million as required by the agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P42_S3	The Washington Commission determined the prudence of PSE entering into the new Chelan contract and confirmed the treatment of the $89.0 million as a regulatory asset as part of its order in PSE s general rate case on January 5, 2007.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	Douglas County PUD began the FERC integrated licensing process in 2004 and is progressing on schedule for a new license upon the current license expiration in May 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	PSE s share of power under the 2001 contract will decline over time as Grant County PUD s load increases.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	PSE s share of both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum developments was 1.2% at the end of 2010 and will not be less than 0.6% through 2052.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	With the exception of a contract with NorthWestern Energy, PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the BPA (for 42 average megawatts (aMW)) and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity) and an energy purchase contract with NorthWestern Energy (for 71 aMW) which terminated on December 29, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	Pursuant to the provisions of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) and Washington state regulations, PSE also enters into long-term firm purchased power contracts with non-utility generators.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P47_S1	PSE purchases the net electrical output of these projects at fixed and annually escalating prices, intended to approximate PSE s avoided cost of new generation projected at the time these agreements were made.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company purchased the following significant power output from the entities:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	Further, PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P49_S1	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P49_S2	These costs are recovered through the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	In 2010, PSE had 4,020 MW and 619 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P52_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P52_S3	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	During 2010, approximately 77.5% of natural gas for power purchased by PSE for power customers originated in British Columbia and 22.5% originated in the United States.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Natural gas is either marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) or injected into the power portfolio s natural gas storage when the natural gas is not needed for the combustion turbines.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file electric and natural gas Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) every two years with the next IRP scheduled to be filed by May 30, 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	PSE filed its most recent IRP with the Washington Commission on July 30, 2009 and an addendum to the 2009 IRP was filed on January 29, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	The IRP demonstrated PSE s continuing need to acquire significant amounts of new generating resources, driven primarily by the expiration of existing power purchase contracts and by the requirements of the state s renewable portfolio standard.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	The IRP, as amended, identifies the following capacity needs:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	To meet these expected shortfalls, the IRP identified a mix of energy efficiency programs, additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and base-load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	The specific resources acquired will be determined through the Company s resource acquisition program which examines specific acquisition and development opportunities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	PSE has enough renewable resources to meet statutory requirements through 2016.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	However, the 2009 IRP determined the cost would be lower by taking advantage of expiring tax incentives rather than waiting until 2016 to develop more renewable energy.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	In 2009, PSE purchased from RES America, Inc., all of the undivided interest in four development-stage wind projects, collectively known as the Lower Snake River wind project in Columbia and Garfield counties in Washington state.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	PSE is currently constructing Phase 1 of the Lower Snake River wind project, which will total 343 MW of capacity when complete.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	In 2010, PSE completed construction of the Phase 1 project roads and turbine foundations in preparation for wind turbine delivery and installation in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P59_S3	Phase 1 is expected to be in commercial operation by April 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed-price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	For baseload, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in off-peak periods, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplant purchases from the U.S.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P63_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P63_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P63_S3	Peaking needs are also met by; using PSE-owned natural gas held in NWP s liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility in Plymouth, Washington; using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; producing propane-air gas at a plant owned by PSE and located on its distribution system; and interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	During 2010, approximately 42.8% of natural gas supplies purchased by PSE for its gas customers originated in British Columbia, while 18.7% originated in Alberta and 38.5% originated in the United States.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during off-peak periods to minimize costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P66_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) whenever on-system customer demand requirements permit and the benefits or costs are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	The facility is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes since it is able to deliver a large volume of natural gas over a relatively short time period.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE has peak firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 460,000 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, which, after reduction for a portion temporarily released to the power portfolio represents nearly 43.5% of PSE s expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S4	PSE s total firm storage capacity of the facility is in excess of 9.8 million Dth.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P67_S5	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	PSE has been expanding the storage capacity at Jackson Prairie since March 2003.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	The most recent withdrawal capacity expansion was placed in service in November 2008 and the reservoir expansion activities will continue through 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	Due to the recent expansion of Jackson Prairie storage withdrawal capacity and storage capacity, PSE s natural gas storage resources are expected to exceed natural gas customer requirements for the next two or three years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Therefore, beginning in 2009 and continuing in 2010, 50,000 Dth per day of natural gas storage withdrawal capacity and 500,000 Dth of natural gas storage capacity have been temporarily released at market sensitive rates to PSE s power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that is used primarily to reduce portfolio costs through supply management efforts that take advantage of market price volatility, and provides system reliability.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P70_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of two and nine years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P70_S2	PSE s maximum firm withdrawal capacity and total storage capacity at Clay Basin, net of releases, is over 90,000 Dth per day and exceeds 10.8 million Dth, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P71_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	PSE contracts for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned gas at NWP s Plymouth facility, which is approximately three and one-half day s supply at a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	This propane-air injection facility is designed to deliver the equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P75_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	PSE holds approximately 520,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	In addition, PSE holds approximately 524,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie and the Plymouth LNG facility during the heating season.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NWP through various contracts that supply electric generating facilities with approximately 168,000 Dth per day.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S3	PSE participates in the pipeline capacity release market to achieve savings for PSE s customers and has released certain segments of temporarily surplus firm capacity to third parties.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 34 years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P77_S5	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P78_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is approximately 130,000 Dth under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to eight years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P78_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling approximately 73,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to eight years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P78_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of one to 13 years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P78_S3	PSE has annual renewal rights on this capacity.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P78_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity on the GTN pipeline, totaling approximately 90,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of 13 years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S0	The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S3	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S4	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P79_S5	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P80_S0	PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue cost-effective reductions in electric power consumption.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P81_S0	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P81_S1	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P81_S2	As described below, PSE recovers the actual costs of electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through a tracker mechanism (for natural gas) and a rider mechanism (for electric) so that these expenditures have no impact on earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P81_S3	However, the rider mechanism does not provide for any cost recovery of lost sales margin associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P82_S0	PSE s rates are designed to capture most of the approved revenue requirements for fixed costs through volumetric rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P82_S1	PSE fully recovers these costs only if its customers consume a certain level of natural gas and electricity.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P82_S2	This level of consumption is typically established in the utility s most recently completed rate case based upon historical natural gas and electric volumes.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P82_S3	When customers use less natural gas or electricity, whether due to conservation, weather or economic conditions, PSE s financial performance is negatively impacted because recovery of fixed costs is reduced in proportion to the reduction in natural gas or electric sales.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P83_S0	Since 1995, PSE has been authorized by the Washington Commission to defer natural gas energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures and recover them through a tracker mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P83_S1	The tracker mechanism allows PSE to defer efficiency expenditures and recover them in rates over the subsequent year.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P83_S2	The tracker mechanism also allows PSE to recover an allowance for funds used to conserve energy on any outstanding balance that is not currently being recovered in rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P84_S0	Since May 1997, PSE has recovered direct electric energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through a rider mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P84_S1	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE concurrently collects the efficiency expenditures in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P84_S2	As a result of the rider mechanism, direct electric energy efficiency expenditures are recovered.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P85_S0	PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P85_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_11_ITEM1_P86_S0	PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including seven natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana (Colstrip).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P86_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all have CAA Title V operation permits that must be renewed every five years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P86_S2	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P86_S3	Colstrip represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P87_S0	PSE owns three hydroelectric plants and three wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P88_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P88_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Act.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P88_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P89_S0	PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P89_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE, as well as third party owned properties in which hazardous substances were generated or released.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P90_S0	Cleanup laws PSE may be subject to primarily include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P90_S1	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner, or operator of a contaminated site, as well as, any generator, arranger or disposer regulated substances.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P91_S0	Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, as well as, PCB contaminated wastes.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P91_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and the dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P92_S0	PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water, or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P92_S1	This includes most all generation facilities (all of which have water discharges and some of which have bulk fuel storage), and due to recent changes in state storm water regulations also includes many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P93_S0	In siting new generation, transmission or distribution, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, as well as, other local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P93_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts to the fullest extent possible as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P94_S0	Recent and future environmental law and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on cost of PSE operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P94_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P94_S2	Recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs are described below.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P95_S0	PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P95_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P95_S2	A climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels and PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P95_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P95_S4	PSE will also consider the impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P96_S0	Most recent definitive federal legislative activity on climate change occurred in June 2009; the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P96_S1	The bill implements a cap-and-trade system of allowances to reduce GHG emissions 17.0% below 2005 levels by 2020, reaching an eventual target of 83.0% below 2005 levels by 2050.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P96_S2	However, the 111th Congress ended without enacting any major law to limit or reduce GHG emissions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S0	Recent federal climate change regulation includes the Tailoring Rule, which became effective January 2, 2011, sets permit levels for GHG emissions in two phases for power plants and other large stationary sources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S1	The ruling limits the amount of GHG emissions a facility can emit by requiring installment of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S2	Phase I requires existing facilities that emit more than 100,000 tons of emissions per year to comply with the new BACT rules when air permits are renewed or when major modifications are made after January 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S3	Phase II, which begins after July 2011, requires preconstruction permits using BACT for new projects that emit 100,000 tons of emissions per year or existing projects that make major modifications and that emit more than 75,000 tons per year.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S4	Currently the EPA has only released BACT guidance for coal technology.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S5	The EPA s work to determine natural gas turbine BACT guidance is ongoing.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P97_S6	Potential impacts on Colstrip are being evaluated and impacts to our gas fleet cannot yet be determined.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S0	Beginning on March 31, 2011, PSE will be required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the EPA including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 25,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S1	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S2	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load, which was 20.9 million MWh in 2010, served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S3	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2009 were 14.4 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S4	Since 2009, new generation facilities have resulted in combined GHG emissions of 591,935 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P98_S5	Approximately 36.4% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 5.3 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P99_S0	In November 2010, the EPA released two more GHG reporting rules affecting PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P100_S0	The first rule, commonly referred to as Subpart DD, requires owners and operators of electric power system facilities with a total nameplate capacity exceeding 17,820 pounds of sulfur hexafluoride to report emissions from its use of electrical transmission and distribution equipment.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P100_S1	The second rule, commonly referred to as Subpart W, requires certain oil and natural gas operations, including distribution and storage, to report GHG emissions from leaks and certain combustions activities.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P100_S2	PSE will submit the required information as part of its annual filing to the EPA beginning on March 31, 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P101_S0	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an essential part of the diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P101_S1	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P102_S0	The state of Montana issued regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired plants on October 16, 2006 (with limits of 0.9 lbs/Trillion British thermal units for plants burning coal like that used at Colstrip) which took effect on January 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P102_S1	Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and is operating at a level that meets the current Montana limit.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P102_S2	Compliance based on a rolling 12-month average was confirmed in January 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P102_S3	Colstrip continues to monitor whether additional controls, if any, are necessary depending on actual long-term performance.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P103_S0	Mercury regulation at a federal level is currently in litigation.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P104_S0	Under current court proceedings, the EPA is required to propose a standard that will limit the amount of toxic mercury a coal and oil-fired power plant is allowed to emit.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P104_S1	The proposal deadline is March 16, 2011 with a finalized rule by November 16, 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P104_S2	The EPA will determine the maximum achievable control technology emission rate limitations for coal-fired units based on coal type.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P104_S3	PSE cannot predict with any certainty what the federal mercury limit will be, but Colstrip is currently meeting a relatively low state standard for mercury emissions.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S0	On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S2	In February 2007, Colstrip was notified by the EPA that Colstrip Units 1 2 were determined to be subject to the EPA s BART requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S3	A BART engineering analysis for Colstrip Units 1 2 was submitted in August 2007 and additional requested analyses were submitted in June 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S4	On November 5, 2010, the EPA issued a request for additional reasonable progress information for Colstrip Units 3 4 which is currently being prepared.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P105_S5	PSE cannot yet determine the outcome of these analyses or information requests.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P106_S0	On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking for the Identification and Listing of Special Wastes: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities which proposes different regulatory mechanisms to regulate coal ash.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P106_S1	The EPA received numerous comments on the respective proposals in November 2010, including comments from PSE and other Colstrip owners.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P106_S2	The EPA has announced that a final rule will be issued in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P107_S0	To date, EPA has proposed three regulatory options.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P107_S1	Under the first two options, coal ash could be regulated as a solid waste under Subtitle D provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P107_S2	This would give authority to the states to oversee a set of performance standards for handling and disposal.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P107_S3	Coal ash would be listed as non-hazardous and would allow wet handling to continue, and it would allow continued use of surface impoundments provided they are equipped with protective liners.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P107_S4	One of these two options would require significantly less modifications to closed as well as in-use impoundments.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P108_S0	Under the third option, coal ash could be regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C provisions of the RCRA, which would make coal ash subject to a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P108_S1	Regulation under Subtitle C would essentially require the phase-out of wet handling and surface impoundments.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P108_S2	The EPA estimates over 500 surface impoundments would be affected by this ruling.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P108_S3	The EPA is expected to issue a final ruling in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P109_S0	Impact to Colstrip operations and PSE, could range from minimal to significant.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P109_S1	Due to the wide range in the options proposed by EPA PSE cannot determine impacts with any more certainty at this time, but we are involved with monitoring development of the final rule and advocating for reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P110_S0	On April 7, 2010, the EPA issued a Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of PCB-containing equipment.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P110_S1	EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P110_S2	This would likely remove all existing use authorizations for PCBs in electrical and gas pipeline equipment.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P110_S3	As proposed, the ANPRM would mandate a phase out of in-service PCBs through a phased process with full removal achieved by 2025.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P111_S0	The end of the comment period for the ANPRM was initially July 6, 2010 but due to the volume of comments received, an extension was granted to August 20, 2010 with the suggested issuance of a Notice in May 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P111_S1	PSE provided comments through both the Utilities Solid Waste Advocacy Group (USWAG) as well as the American Gas Association (AGA).
1085392_11_ITEM1_P111_S2	Upon receiving all comments, EPA has rescheduled the issuance to April 2013.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P111_S3	At this time, PSE cannot determine what the impacts of this NPRM will have on its operations but will continue to work closely with USWAG and AGA to monitor develops and advocate for a reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P112_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 1, 2011 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P113_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P114_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 1, 2011 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_11_ITEM1_P115_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P3_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based in part on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about rate year hydrological conditions and power costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Non-energy costs for natural gas retail customers are based on historic test year costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, the Washington Commission decides what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P6_S5	For these reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE may be unable to acquire energy supply resources to meet projected customer needs or may fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	PSE projects that future energy needs will exceed current purchased and Company-controlled power resources.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As part of PSE s business strategy, it plans to acquire additional electric generation and delivery infrastructure to meet customer needs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If PSE cannot acquire additional energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could significantly increase its expenses thus reducing earnings and cash flows.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Additionally, PSE may not be able to timely recover some or all of those increased expenses through ratemaking.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	While PSE expects to identify the benefits of new energy supply resources prior to their acquisition and integration, it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such energy supply sources.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, increased customer demand for energy, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Factors which could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its load requirements and/or high volumes of energy purchased in wholesale markets at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods or other similar occurrences.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	In connection with matching loads and resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PSE may use forward delivery agreements, swaps and option contracts to hedge commodity price risk with a diverse group of counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	However, PSE does not always cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P21_S2	To the extent PSE has unhedged positions or its hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could adversely impact its results of operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, including air and climate protection, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, waste handling and disposal, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To comply with these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities which may substantially increase environmental expenditures incurred by PSE in the future.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	With respect to endangered species laws, the listing or proposed listing of several species of salmon in the Pacific Northwest is causing a number of changes to the operations of hydroelectric generating facilities on Pacific Northwest rivers, including the Columbia River.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These changes could reduce the amount, and increase the cost, of power generated by hydroelectric plants owned by PSE, or in which PSE has an interest, and increase the cost of the permitting process for these facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or the new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington state has adopted both a renewable portfolio standard and greenhouse gas legislation, including an emission performance standard provision.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S1	PSE cannot yet determine the costs of compliance with the recently enacted legislation.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P26_S3	While PSE cannot yet determine costs associated with these or future decisions or potential future legislation, there may be a significant impact on the cost of carbon-intensive coal generation, in particular.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE s business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund its utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	If PSE is unable to access capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of PSE s credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under its credit facility in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PSE s operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE s business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, demand depends heavily on weather patterns in PSE s service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenue is recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S2	However, conservation efforts may result in decreased customer demand, despite normal or lower than normal temperatures.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S3	Demand for electricity is also greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S4	Accordingly, PSE s operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P30_S5	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond and repair the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P32_S2	In addition, a slow response to extreme events may have an adverse affect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	PSE may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P36_S1	PSE also hires third parties to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P36_S2	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and therefore, continued adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2011 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in general rate cases could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital and the ability to hedge in wholesale markets.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these taxes.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P44_S4	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P46_S1	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution, unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 46.5% at December 31, 2010 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 3.9 to one.
1085392_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Gas Supply.
1085392_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of legal proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_11_ITEM3_P1_S0	The following discussion summarizes the status as of the date of this report of ongoing proceedings relating to the western power markets to which PSE is a party.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P1_S1	PSE is vigorously defending the remaining claims.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P1_S2	Litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and PSE is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P1_S3	Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that these proceedings will not materially and adversely affect PSE s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P2_S0	In October 2000, PSE filed a complaint with the FERC (Docket No.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P2_S1	EL01-10) against all jurisdictional sellers in the Pacific Northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result the FERC ordered for the California markets.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P2_S2	The FERC issued an order including price caps in July 2001, and PSE moved to dismiss the proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P3_S0	In response to PSE s motion, various entities intervened and sought to convert PSE s complaint into one seeking retroactive refunds in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P3_S1	The FERC rejected that effort, after holding what the FERC referred to as a preliminary evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P3_S2	In April 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) rejected the requests for rehearing filed in this matter and remanded the proceeding to the FERC.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P3_S3	The FERC is now considering what response to take to the Ninth Circuit remand order, as petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied on January 11, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P3_S4	PSE intends to vigorously defend its position but is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P4_S0	In May 2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs initiated an action against the owners of Colstrip regarding pond seepage.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P4_S1	The defendants reached an agreement on a global settlement with all plaintiffs and PSE expensed its share of the settlement in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P4_S2	PSE received a partial reimbursement for its share from insurers in December 2010 and January 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P5_S0	On March 29, 2007, a second complaint related to pond seepage was filed on behalf of two ranch owners alleging damage due to the Colstrip Units 3 4 effluent holding pond.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P5_S1	A mediation between plaintiffs and PPL Montana, LLC, the operator of Units 3 4, took place in July 2010 and parties are working toward a final settlement.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P6_S0	Petitioners in several actions in the Ninth Circuit against the BPA asserted that the BPA acted contrary to law in entering into or performing or implementing a number of agreements, including the amended settlement agreement (and the May 2004 agreement) between the BPA and PSE regarding the Residential Exchange Program (REP).
1085392_11_ITEM3_P6_S1	Petitioners in several actions in the Ninth Circuit against the BPA also asserted that the BPA acted contrary to law in adopting or implementing the rates upon which the benefits received or to be received from the BPA during the October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2006 period were based.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P7_S0	A number of parties claimed that the rates the BPA proposed or adopted in the BPA rate proceeding to develop the BPA rates to be used in the agreements for determining the amounts of money to be paid to PSE by the BPA during the period October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2009 are contrary to law.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P7_S1	Furthermore, parties claimed the BPA acted contrary to law or without authority in deciding to enter into, or in entering into or performing or implementing such agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P8_S0	On May 3, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion in Portland Gen. Elec. v. BPA , Case No. 01-70003, in which proceeding the actions of the BPA in entering into settlement agreements regarding the REP with PSE and with other investor-owned utilities were challenged.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P8_S1	In this opinion, the Ninth Circuit granted petitions for review and held the settlement agreements entered into between the BPA and the investor-owned utilities being challenged in that proceeding to be inconsistent with statute.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P8_S2	On May 3, 2007, the Ninth Circuit also issued an opinion in Golden Northwest Aluminum v. BPA , Case No. 03-73426, in which proceeding the petitioners sought review of the BPA s 2002-2006 power rates.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P8_S3	In this opinion, the Ninth Circuit granted petitions for review and held that BPA unlawfully shifted onto its preference customers the costs of its settlements with the investor-owned utilities.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P8_S4	On October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit remanded the May 2004 agreement to the BPA in light of the Portland Gen. Elec. v. BPA opinion and dismissed the remaining three pending cases regarding settlement agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P9_S0	In March 2008, the BPA and PSE signed an agreement pursuant to which the BPA made a payment to PSE related to the REP benefits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, which payment is subject to true-up depending upon the amount of any REP benefits ultimately determined to be payable to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S0	In September 2008, the BPA issued its record of decision in its reopened WP-07 rate proceeding to respond to the various Ninth Circuit opinions.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S1	In this record of decision, the BPA adjusted its fiscal year 2009 rates, determined the amounts of REP benefits it considered to have been improperly paid after fiscal year 2001 to PSE and the other regional investor-owned utilities, and determined that such amounts are to be recovered through reductions in REP benefit payments to be made over a number of years.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S2	The amount determined by the BPA to be recovered through reductions commencing October 2007 in REP payments for PSE s residential and small farm customers was approximately $207.2 million plus interest on unrecovered amounts to the extent that PSE receives any REP benefits for its customers in the future.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S3	However, these BPA determinations are subject to subsequent administrative and judicial review, which may alter or reverse such determinations.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S4	PSE and others, including a number of preference agency and investor-owned utility customers of the BPA, in December 2008 filed petitions for review in the Ninth Circuit of various of these BPA determinations.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P10_S5	Any change to the REP would be passed to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P11_S0	In September 2008, the BPA and PSE signed a short-term Residential Purchase and Sale Agreement (RPSA) under which the BPA is to pay REP benefits to PSE for fiscal years ending September 30, 2009 through 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P11_S1	In December 2008, the BPA and PSE signed another, long-term RPSA under which the BPA is to pay REP benefits to PSE for the period October 2011 through September 2028.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P12_S0	PSE and other customers of the BPA in December 2008 filed petitions for review in the Ninth Circuit of the short-term and long-term RPSAs signed by PSE (and similar RPSAs signed by other investor-owned utility customers of the BPA) and the BPA s record of decision regarding such RPSAs.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P13_S0	Generally, REP benefit payments under a RPSA are based on the amount, if any, by which a utility s average system cost exceeds the BPA s Priority Firm (PF) Exchange rate for such utility.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P14_S0	The average system cost for a utility is determined using an average system cost methodology adopted by the BPA.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P14_S1	The average system cost methodology adopted by the BPA and the average system cost determinations, REP overpayment determinations, and the PF Exchange rate determinations by the BPA are all subject to the FERC review or judicial review or both and are subject to adjustment, which may affect the amount of REP benefits paid or to be paid by the BPA to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P14_S2	As discussed above, the BPA has determined to reduce such payments based on its determination of REP benefit overpayments after fiscal year 2001.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P15_S0	It is not clear what impact, if any, such development or review of such BPA rates, average system cost, average system cost methodology, and the BPA determination of REP overpayments, review of such agreements, and the above described Ninth Circuit litigation may ultimately have on PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P16_S0	On July 7, 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington by the Snoqualmie Valley Preservation Alliance, a group of downstream landowners, against the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) challenging permits issued by the Corps in connection with the redevelopment of the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P16_S1	Plaintiffs requested an order to stop work at the project pending further review of downstream impacts.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P16_S2	PSE sought and was granted permission to intervene in the proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P17_S0	Motions for summary judgment have been filed by the plaintiff and the Corps.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P17_S1	PSE joined the Corps motion and filed a motion for summary judgment arguing the plaintiff s claims are barred as untimely and improper.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P17_S2	The parties await a determination by the Court.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P17_S3	The ultimate impact of the suit, if any, on PSE or the work currently underway on the project cannot be determined at this time.
1085392_11_ITEM3_P17_S4	The construction schedule has not been impacted by the lawsuit.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	Upon the completion of the merger on February 6, 2009, Puget Energy s common stock was delisted from trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
1085392_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	As a result of the merger, all of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P0_S2	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	In the first quarter of 2009, prior to the merger, Puget Energy declared quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.25 per share on each share of common stock outstanding and, in connection with the February 6, 2009 merger, Puget Energy also declared a special pro rata dividend of $0.04448 per share.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P2_S1	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM5_P2_S2	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.

1085392_11_ITEM6_P2_S3	For a description of this transaction, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	All outstanding shares of preferred stock of PSE were redeemed in March 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	In connection with the merger, Puget Energy and PSE amended in their entirety their respective Articles of Incorporation and preferred stock is no longer authorized.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S1	The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy and PSE objectives, expectations and intentions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S2	Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S3	However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S4	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S5	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company .
1085392_11_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, Macquarie-FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result of the merger, Puget Energy is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Equico, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE s basis of accounting continues to be on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P4_S1	To meet customer growth, to replace expiring power contracts and to meet Washington state s renewable energy portfolio standards, PSE is increasing energy efficiency programs to reduce the demand for additional energy generation and is pursuing additional renewable energy production resources (primarily wind) and base load natural gas-fired generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P5_S1	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, PSE s net income was adversely affected by the following five factors: (1) the impact of falling wholesale forward prices of electricity and natural gas on mark-to-market unrealized gains/losses on energy derivative contracts; (2) a decline in electric and natural gas retail and transportation customer sales primarily due to unusually warm temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 and weak economic conditions; (3) the effect of higher power costs resulting from below average hydrological and wind conditions that negatively impacted PSE s electric generation; (4) PSE s general tariff increases approved in April 2010, which were based on historical costs for non-power related items, are insufficient to recover capital and operating costs incurred and are anticipated to incur in the future; and (5) an adjustment in the California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset carrying value of PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized loss on derivative instruments dividend by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	This measure is a supplemental financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a Company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P9_S1	The presentation of return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments is intended to supplement readers understanding of the Company s operating performance.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	Return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instrument is used by the Company to determine whether the Company is collecting the appropriate earnings from its customers to allow recovery of investor s capital.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace return on equity (net income dividend by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company faced certain challenges during 2010 which caused a significant reduction in the return on equity as compared to other years.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following table presents PSE s return on equity for 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	The authorized regulated return on equity was approved by the Washington Commission in its general rate case order which became effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company's 2010 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 4.4%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity due to the following:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	Electric retail kilowatt sales and natural gas therm sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 declined 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, as compared to historical averages due to warmer temperatures in the first quarter of 2010 which is one of its highest revenue quarters for the year and, to a lesser extent, the impact of PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs, as well as continued effects of weak economic conditions in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Pacific Northwest experienced below normal hydrological and wind conditions which adversely impacted PSE s power costs in the first quarter of 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P15_S1	Hydroelectric and wind generation for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 700,511 MWhs, or 11.8%, as compared to historical averages.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P15_S2	As a result, PSE s power costs in excess of the baseline rate was $29.2 million due to purchasing or generating higher cost electricity to replace the decrease in generation from hydroelectric and wind generating projects.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	PSE had requested electric and natural gas rate increases of $110.3 million and $27.2 million, respectively in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P16_S1	The Washington Commission approved general rate case increases of $74.1 million and $18.3 million for electric and natural gas customers, respectively which were effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P16_S2	The difference between the allowed and requested increases included a rate of return with a lower equity return and lower equity component then requested, in addition to stricter interpretation of proforma adjustments from what was previously allowed.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	As a result of the Washington Commission order of May 20, 2010, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million pre-tax (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), which impacted wholesale energy sales.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	PSE s regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2011 and future years.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales, as well as by its customers conservation investments, which also tend to reduce energy sales.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is an important item influencing its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are determined by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S3	The Washington Commission determines these rates based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydrological conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S4	cost growth, thus rate increases are required.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S5	If, in a particular rate year, PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S6	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether expenses and investments are reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P20_S7	If the Washington Commission determines that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard applied, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	For additional information on electric rates, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	The following table sets forth rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually or $10.1 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	For additional information on gas rates, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Weather conditions in PSE s service territory can have a significant impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE s revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	PSE s operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P28_S1	While both PSE s electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by consumers occur from season to season and from month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P28_S2	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales and, subsequently, higher power costs during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P28_S3	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	PSE reported lower customer usage for the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to warmer temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The average temperature during the first quarter of 2010 was 46.8 degrees, or 6.2 degrees warmer than the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P29_S2	As a result of the warmer first quarter of 2010, heating degree days (difference in average daily temperature compared to 65 degrees) for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 7.1% lower than the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above electric customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	Both residential electric and natural gas customers are expected to continue a long-term trend of slow decline of energy usage based on continued energy efficiency improvements and the effect of higher retail rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The effects of the current recession on Washington s economy have exacerbated a decline in customer usage throughout 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P32_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P32_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company s ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P32_S3	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s credit facilities, both of which expire in 2014, the borrowing costs and commitment fees increase as their respective credit ratings decline.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P32_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	Such regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P34_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality (including climate change) and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation byproducts such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company s operations.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P34_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts fulfilling requirements by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates, and on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees in order to comply with these regulatory requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change and generation byproducts could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	As noted in PSE s IRP filed with the Washington Commission, PSE projects future energy needs will exceed current resources from long-term power purchase agreements and Company-controlled power resources.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P36_S1	The IRP identifies reductions in contractual supplies of energy and capacity available under certain long-term power purchase agreements, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P36_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, significantly increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	PSE is investing in its utility infrastructure and customer service functions in order to meet regulatory requirements, serve customers energy needs and replace aging infrastructure.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	These investments and operating requirements give rise to significant growth in depreciation and operating expenses, which are not recovered through the ratemaking process in a timely manner.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	This regulatory lag is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	Operational Risks Associated With Generating Facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels, including facility shutdowns due to equipment and process failures or fuel supply interruptions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	PSE does not have business interruption insurance coverage to cover replacement power costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	Energy Efficiency Related Lost Sales Margin.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	PSE s sales, margins, earnings and cash flow are adversely affected by its energy efficiency programs, many of which are mandated by law.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	The Company is evaluating strategies and other means to reduce or eliminate these adverse financial effects.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The Company is actively engaged in monitoring the development of the commercial markets for such intangible power attributes as RECs and carbon financial instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P44_S1	The Company supports the development of regional and national markets for such products that are free, open, transparent and liquid.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	Set forth below is the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	PSE s net income in 2010 was $26.1 million with operating revenue of $3.1 billion as compared to $159.3 million with operating revenue of $3.3 billion in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	The following are significant factors that impacted PSE s net income for the year ended December 31, 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	Increase in net unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $168.2 million primarily due to falling forward market prices of electricity and natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	PSE s discontinuation of cash flow hedge accounting on July 1, 2009 resulted in additional volatility in net income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	Increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $31.4 million primarily due to additional capital expenditures on utility plant placed in service.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Increase in interest expense of $18.3 million related to additional debt outstanding.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	Decrease in sales to other utilities and marketers of $15.6 million primarily due to the carrying value adjustment of the California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset of $17.8 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	Decrease in income tax expense of $67.5 million, primarily due to lower taxable income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	Decrease in purchased electricity and electric generation fuel of $53.6 million primarily due to lower wholesale costs, lower customer usage offset by higher generation from coal fired plants.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	Decrease in one-time merger costs of $23.9 million related to the merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	These costs were primarily related to PSE employee compensation triggered by Puget Energy s change of control, credit agreement related expenses and the impact of increases in the deferred compensation related liability.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	PSE s net income in 2009 was $159.3 million with operating revenue of $3.3 billion as compared to $162.7 million with operating revenue of $3.4 billion in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	The following are significant factors that impacted PSE s net income for the year ended December 31, 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	Increase in utility operations and maintenance of $25.8 million mainly due to increases in customer service expense and bad debts expense.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Increase from one-time merger costs of $23.9 million related to the merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	These costs were primarily related to PSE employee compensation triggered by Puget Energy s change of control, credit agreement related expenses and the impact of increases in the deferred compensation related liability.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	Increase in depreciation and amortization of $20.7 million primarily due to additional capital expenditures that were placed into service.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	Increase in residential exchange credits for power costs of $55.8 million from the BPA, which was a pass-through to PSE customers, reflected as a reduction in PSE electric operating revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	Increase in other income and expenses of $20.3 million primarily due to an increase in regulatory interest income from the Mint Farm deferral.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	Decrease in purchased electricity and electric generation fuel of $19.9 million as a result of lower customer usage and lower wholesale market prices.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	Decrease in purchased gas of $19.0 million due to lower customer usage and a decrease in PGA rates as a result of declining natural gas wholesale costs and a reduction of the credit for accumulated PGA payable balance.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Electric retail sales increased $10.2 million, or 0.5%, to $2.03 billion from $2.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	The increase in electric retail sales was due to a $47.9 million electric rate increase effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	Partially offsetting the increase in electric retail sales was an $88.8 million decline in retail electricity usage of 965,695 MWhs, or 4.4%, primarily due to warmer than average temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S3	The average temperature during the first quarter of 2010 was 46.8 degrees, or 6.2 degrees warmer than the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S4	As a result of the warmer first quarter of 2010, heating degree days for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 7.1% lower than the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S5	The decline in retail electricity usage was also due to an increase in PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S6	Also contributing to the increase in retail sales are pass-through items with no impact to earnings including a $22.3 million increase attributable to a decrease in benefits (credits to customers) of the Residential and Small Farm Energy Exchange Benefit, a $20.2 million increase due to conservation rider program rate increases and a $17.0 million increase in retail sales related to the suspension of the PTC tariff effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S7	PTCs that are generated and provided to customers are recorded as a reduction in other electric operating revenue until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return at which time the PTCs will be credited to customers in retail sales.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S8	Additionally, PSE s customers were credited $10.5 million for REC revenue effective November 1, 2010, resulting in a decrease in electric retail sales.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S9	The $10.5 million credits to customers is offset in other electric operating revenue with no impact to earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P65_S10	PSE s customers will continue to receive credits through March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $15.6 million, or 19.8%, to $62.9 million from $78.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	This decrease was primarily due to a carrying value adjustment of $17.8 million related to PSE s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	Additionally, PSE s average wholesale electric sales prices declined which decreased revenue $15.2 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	Sales volumes decreased 28,981 MWhs, or 1.1% which decreased revenue $0.7 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P67_S0	Other operating revenue increased $13.7 million, or 115.5%, to $1.8 million from a loss of $(11.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P67_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-core gas sales of $9.9 million and REC revenue of $10.5 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P68_S0	As discussed above, REC revenue is an offset of the REC credit provided to PSE s customers in electric retail sales with no impact to earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P68_S1	Partially offsetting the increase to other operating revenue was $7.3 million of PTCs which are deferred until PSE utilizes tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P69_S0	Natural gas retail sales decreased $209.7 million, or 17.6%, to $982.7 million from $1.19 billion during year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P69_S1	This decrease was primarily due to a $115.4 million decrease in gas operating revenue as a result of PGA rate decreases effective June 1, 2009 and October 1, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P70_S0	The PGA mechanism passes through to customer increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P70_S1	PSE s net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P70_S2	The decrease in natural gas retail sales was also due to a decrease of 87.6 million in natural gas therm sales, or 7.7%, which decreased revenue by $107.2 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P70_S3	The decrease was due primarily to warmer than average temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to 2009, an increase in PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P71_S0	Purchased electricity expenses decreased $113.3 million, or 12.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P71_S1	The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in purchased power of 1,349,571 MWhs, or 8.9%, resulting in a decrease of $71.6 million and by lower wholesale market prices which contributed $44.5 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P71_S2	The decrease in purchased power for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily the result of lower customer usage related to warmer than normal temperatures during 2010, a weak economy in the Pacific Northwest and 18.7% higher generation of electricity from PSE s coal-fired generation facility, Colstrip, due to Colstrip Unit 4 having an extended outage in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P72_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P72_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P72_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P73_S0	Electric generation fuel expense increased $59.7 million, or 28.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P73_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $44.5 million increase in costs at PSE s combustion turbine facilities and a $15.2 million increase related to increased generation at Colstrip in 2010 due to the Colstrip Unit 4 extended outage in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P73_S2	Also contributing to the increased electric generation fuel expense at company-owned natural gas facilities was an 8.0% decrease in hydroelectric generation by Company-owned facilities and under take-or-pay purchased electricity contracts partially offset by an increase in wind generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P74_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $21.4 million, or 22.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of lower electric residential and farm customer sales volumes associated with the BPA REP.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P75_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P76_S0	Purchased gas expense decreased $182.9 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P76_S1	The decrease was due to a 7.7% decrease in customer usage and natural gas costs reflected in PGA rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P76_S2	The decrease in customer usage was mainly due to a 7.1% decrease in heating degrees days during 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, the impact of PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S0	The PGA mechanism provides the rates used to determine natural gas costs based on customer usage.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S1	The rate decrease was the result of declining costs of wholesale natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S2	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S3	The PGA mechanism receivable balance at December 31, 2010 was $6.0 million as compared to payable balance of $49.6 million at December 31, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S4	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S5	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P77_S6	A payable balance reflects overrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P78_S0	Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments changed by $168.2 million to a loss of $167.0 million in 2010, as compared to a gain of $(1.3) million in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P78_S1	The loss was primarily due to the decline in wholesale energy prices during 2010 which resulted in unrealized losses on contracts for future deliveries of energy commodities which we record as derivative instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P79_S0	On July 1, 2009, PSE elected to de-designate its energy related derivative contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P79_S1	The contracts that were de-designated were physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P79_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market accounting impacts are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P79_S3	The amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings when the contracts settle or sooner, if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P79_S4	As a result, PSE will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P80_S0	Over the tenor of PSE s outstanding derivative contracts, the forward wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas declined 21.0% and 27.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P81_S0	Merger and related costs associated with the merger with Puget Holdings incurred for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $23.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P81_S1	These costs were due to one-time PSE employee compensation costs, expenses related to the termination of credit agreements, legal fees and deferred compensation liability increases triggered by the merger in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P81_S2	Pursuant to the Washington Commission merger order commitments, PSE did not seek recovery of these costs in retail rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P82_S0	Depreciation expense increased $23.2 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P82_S1	This increase was primarily due to new additions of electric, natural gas and common plant which were placed into service in 2010 and the full year effect of plant placed in service throughout 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P83_S0	Amortization expense increased $8.1 million, or 12.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 due to the inclusion of Mint Farm and Wild Horse expansion operating and ownership costs in general rates effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P83_S1	PSE ceased deferral of these costs effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P83_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software amortization.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P84_S0	Conservation amortization increased $23.6 million, or 35.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P84_S1	The increase was due to a higher authorized recovery of electric and natural gas conservation expenditures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P85_S0	Conservation amortization is a pass-through tariff item with no impact on earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P86_S0	Taxes other than income taxes decreased $10.8 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P86_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sensitive taxes due to lower retail sales which were partially offset by an increase in property taxes.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P87_S0	Other income decreased $7.7 million, or 14.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the carrying costs associated with the Mint Farm regulatory asset being included in general rates effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P88_S0	Prior to April 8, 2010, the Mint Farm regulatory asset was accruing interest income as authorized by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P88_S1	Also contributing to the decrease was a $7.0 million decrease due to the Washington Commission Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P88_S2	These decreases were partially offset by an $8.5 million increase in AFUDC equity income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P89_S0	Interest expense increased $18.3 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P89_S1	The increase was primarily due to a write off of a regulatory asset of deferred interest paid to the IRS of $6.9 million related to the Simplified Service Cost Method deduction from prior years which was disallowed in the Washington Commission general rate case order of April 2, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P89_S2	Also impacting the increase was higher long-term debt outstanding and interest on regulatory liability associated with RECs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P90_S0	Income tax expense decreased $67.5 million or 99.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P90_S1	The decrease was primarily related to lower pre-tax income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P91_S0	Electric retail sales increased $40.0 million, or 2.0%, to $2.02 billion from $1.98 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P91_S1	The increase in electric retail sales was primarily due to an electric general rate increase of 7.1% effective November 1, 2008, that was partially offset by a merger rate credit, which contributed to an increase in electric retail sales of $109.3 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P91_S2	Partially offsetting the increase in electric retail sales was an increase in the benefits (credits to customers) of the Residential and Small Farm Energy Exchange Benefit which reduced electric operating revenue by $58.4 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P91_S3	The credits of the Residential and Small Farm Energy Exchange Benefit also reduced power costs by a corresponding amount resulting in no impact to earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P91_S4	In addition, electric operating revenue decreased $13.7 million due to a decline in retail electricity usage of 148,516 MWhs, or 0.7%, related to lower customer usage.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P92_S0	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $6.2 million, or 7.4%, to $78.5 million from $84.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P92_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a decline in PSE s average wholesale electric sales price of $33.3 million which was partially offset by $26.7 million due to an increase in sales volume of 862,535 MWh or 51.8%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P93_S0	Other electric operating revenue decreased $67.3 million, to $(11.9) million from $55.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P93_S1	The decrease was primarily due to $54.7 million related losses from natural gas hedging contracts and $7.6 million decrease in non-core gas sales.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P93_S2	Such gains or losses on the sale of natural gas, which was intended to be used for electric generation, are included as a component of PSE s PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P93_S3	In addition, other electric operating revenue decreased due to a reduction in transmission revenue and other miscellaneous operating revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P94_S0	Natural gas retail sales increased $7.9 million, or 0.7%, to $1.192 billion from $1.184 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P94_S1	This increase was primarily due to a $50.5 million increase in gas operating revenue as a result of a gas general rate increase of 4.6% effective November 1, 2008 and PGA rate increase effective October 1, 2008, partially offset by PGA rate decreases of June 1, 2009 and October 1, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P95_S0	The PGA mechanism passes through to customer increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P95_S1	PSE s net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P95_S2	Partially offsetting the increase in natural gas retail sales was a decrease of 35.6 million in natural gas therm sales, or 3.7%, which decreased revenue by $44.4 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P96_S0	Non-utility operating revenue decreased $6.4 million, or 56.1%, to $5.0 million from $11.4 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P96_S1	The decrease was due to lower property sales by PSE s real estate subsidiary, which reduced revenue by $3.6 million, and lower revenue related to non-tariff customer support work performed by PSE, which reduced revenue by $3.0 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Purchased electricity expenses decreased $16.0 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	This decrease was primarily due to lower customer usage related to weak economic conditions and higher generation from natural gas combustion turbines as a result of the Colstrip Unit 4 outage and lower hydroelectric and wind generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $3.9 million, or 1.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	This decrease was primarily due to an $8.6 million decrease in coal-burned fuel due to the outage of Colstrip Unit 4.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	The unit was taken offline in March 2009 to conduct maintenance and repair and was returned to service in October 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	The decrease was partially offset by a $4.8 million increase in combustion turbine generation costs due to lower hydroelectric and wind generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	Residential exchange credits increased $55.8 million, or 137.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	The increase was a result of an agreement with the BPA to continue to pass on REP benefits to PSE s customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue; thus, it has no impact on net income.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	Purchased gas expenses decreased $19.0 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a 3.7% decrease in customer usage and changes to PGA rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The PGA mechanism provides the rates used to determine natural gas costs based on customer usage.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P103_S1	The rate decrease was the result of declining costs of wholesale natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P103_S2	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P103_S3	The PGA mechanism payable balance at December 31, 2009 was $49.6 million as compared to $8.9 million at December 31, 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P104_S1	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P104_S2	A payable balance reflects overrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments changed by $8.8 million, to a gain of $(1.3) million in 2009, as compared to a loss of $7.5 million in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S1	The gain was primarily due to mark-to-market accounting for PSE s energy derivative contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S2	On July 1, 2009, PSE elected to de-designate its energy related derivative contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S3	The contracts that were de-designated are physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S4	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market accounting impacts are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S5	The amount in OCI is transferred to earnings when the contracts settle or sooner, if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S6	As a result, PSE will continue to experience earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P105_S7	For the year ended December 31, 2009, PSE recognized a $135.5 million gain from the transfer in OCI when contracts settled, which was offset by a $126.6 million loss from unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense increased $25.8 million, or 5.6%, to $487.4 million from $461.6 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The increase was driven by an $18.6 million increase in customer service expenses, which included a $4.9 million increase in bad debt expense, administrative costs and electric transmission and distribution costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P106_S2	Also contributing to the increase was a $2.1 million increase in gas operations costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	Merger and related costs associated with the merger with Puget Holdings increased $23.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P107_S1	These costs were due to one-time PSE employee compensation costs, expenses related to the termination of credit agreements, legal fees and deferred compensation liability increases triggered by the merger in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P107_S2	Pursuant to the Washington Commission merger order commitments, PSE will not seek recovery of these costs in retail rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Depreciation expense increased $13.7 million, or 5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P108_S1	This increase was primarily due to additional capital expenditures that were placed into service.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Amortization expense increased $7.0 million, or 12.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	This increase was due to an increase in storm amortization costs as approved in PSE s general rate case effective November 1, 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	Amortization expense included a benefit related to the deferral of Mint Farm fixed cost of $14.1 million which, had it not been included as a reduction to amortization expense would have increased by $34.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	Conservation amortization increased $4.8 million, or 7.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P110_S1	The increase was due to a higher authorized recovery of electric and natural gas conservation expenditures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Conservation amortization is a pass-through tariff item with no impact on earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	Taxes other than income taxes increased $6.2 million, or 2.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The increase was primarily due to revenue sensitive taxes from increased revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	Other income increased $19.6 million, or 58.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in regulatory interest income from the Mint Farm which contributed $14.7 million, AFUDC of $2.6 million and $2.2 million gain on PSE trust owned life insurance.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	Interest expense increased $7.8 million, or 4.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	The increase was primarily due to issuance of higher rate long-term debt and an increase in the amortization of costs of credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	Income tax expense increased $6.7 million, or 11.11%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P115_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate to 29.8% from 27.2%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P115_S2	The increase in effective tax rate was mainly due to lower wind generation in 2009 as compared to 2008, which resulted in lower PTCs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	All the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its subsidiary PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Predecessor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE prior to the consummation of the merger on February 6, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	Successor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE subsequent to the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date with the remaining consideration recorded as goodwill.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S3	The fair values of assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits derived from such assets.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S4	Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P117_S5	Such adjustments to fair value and the allocation of purchase price between identifiable intangibles and goodwill will have an impact on Puget Energy s expenses and profitability.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	Puget Energy s net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P119_S0	Puget Energy s interest expense includes elimination adjustments of intercompany interest on short-term debt.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	Puget Energy s net income for 2010 was $30.3 million with operating revenue of $3.1 billion as compared to net income of $186.8 million with operating revenue of $3.3 billion for 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P121_S0	Net unrealized gain on derivative instruments decreased $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, as a result of the required recognition of all contracts at fair value as part of purchase accounting, including derivative contracts previously designated as Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P121_S1	Certain of these contracts were subsequently redesignated as NPNS.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P122_S0	The unrealized gain represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P123_S0	Non-utility expense and other costs increased $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due primarily to the write down of SO2 emissions allowance inventory of $7.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P124_S0	Merger and related costs decreased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to one-time merger related costs of compensation triggered by Puget Energy s change of control, excise taxes and financial advisor fees.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P125_S0	Unhedged interest rate derivative expense increased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to the de-designation of interest rate swaps associated with the portion of the term-loan that was paid off on December 6, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P126_S0	Charitable contribution expense decreased $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to a charitable contribution to the PSE Foundation in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Interest expense increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	The increase was primarily due to the write-down of unamortized loan issuance costs associated with the portion of the term-loan paid off on December 6, 2010, business combination fair value amortization adjustments related to PSE s long-term debt and deferred debt costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	Income tax expense decreased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income combined with a decrease in the effective tax rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	Puget Energy s net income for 2009 was $186.8 million with operating revenue of $3.3 billion as compared to net income of $154.9 million with operating revenue of $3.4 billion for the same period in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P129_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	Net unrealized gain on derivative instruments increased $151.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, as a result of the required recognition of all contracts at fair value as part of purchase accounting, including derivative contracts previously designated as NPNS.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	Certain of these contracts were subsequently redesignated as NPNS.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	The unrealized gain represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	Merger and related costs increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, due to the merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	These costs were primarily related to real estate, excise taxes, legal fees, transaction advisory services and stock options.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	Non-utility expense and other costs increased $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, due to pension and postretirement plan costs as a result of purchase accounting related to the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Charitable contribution expense increased $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, due to a charitable contribution to the PSE Foundation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	Interest expense increased $72.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008, primarily due to the term-loan and credit facility fees related to the merger on February 6, 2009, which contributed $80.2 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	Offsetting this increase were the business combination fair value amortization of PSE s fair value debt, PSE s deferred debt costs, and PSE treasury locks, which contributed $8.6 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	Income tax expense increased $24.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period in 2008 due to an increase in pre-tax income combined with an increase in the effective tax rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	The effective tax rate increase was attributable primarily to non-deductible merger transaction costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	Energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of PSE s obligation to serve retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	As a result, costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	For individual long-term debt maturities, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P139_S1	For Puget Energy the amount above excludes the fair value adjustments related to the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	Represents operational agreements, settlements and other contractual obligations with respect to generation, transmission and distribution facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	These costs are generally recovered through base retail rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	For additional information, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	Pension and other benefit expected contributions represent PSE s estimated cash contributions to the pension plan through 2015.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had fully drawn on a five-year term-loan with a balance of $782.0 million and incurred a $258.0 million draw under its $1.0 billion Puget Energy capital expenditure facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2010, PSE has a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million of which $22.6 million was drawn.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P145_S0	As of December 31, 2010, PSE had credit facilities totaling $1.15 billion of which $259.6 million had been drawn.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P145_S1	These facilities consisted of $400.0 million to fund operating expenses, $400.0 million to fund capital expenditures and $350.0 million to support energy and natural gas hedging.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P145_S2	In addition, a $12.6 million letter of credit was outstanding under the $400.0 million hedging facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P146_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate availability under commercial commitments as of December 31:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P147_S0	PSE s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system and the natural gas and electric distribution systems are designed to meet regulatory requirements, customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P147_S1	Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $859.1 million in 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P147_S2	As a result of a general slowing in the economy and changes to the Company s proposed resources, PSE s projected construction expenditures have been reduced.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P147_S3	Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, for 2011, 2012 and 2013 are:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P148_S0	The program is subject to change to respond to general business, economic and regulatory conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P149_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources that may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P149_S1	PSE s planned capital expenditures result in a level of spending that will likely exceed its cash flow from operations.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P149_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to the capital markets.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P150_S0	Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $575.8 million, a decrease of $144.9 million from the $720.7 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	The decrease was primarily the result of the following:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	PSE s deferred taxes decreased by $16.3 million in 2010 as compared to tax savings in 2009 of $194.5 million due to bonus depreciation and repair allowance deductions, which decreased cash flow from operating activities by $210.8 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	PSE s PGA mechanism provided $55.6 million payment to customers related to overcollection of prior year plan related rates during the year ended 2010 as compared to an overrecovery from customers of $40.7 million during the same period in 2009, which decreased cash flow from operating activities by $96.3 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue decreased $7.6 million during the year ended 2010 as compared to a decrease of $64.3 million during the same period in 2009, causing an operating cash flow decrease of $56.7 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	The decrease in cash generated from operating activities in 2010 was partially offset by the following:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	Cash received from the sale of RECs of $44.6 million during the year ended 2010 as compared to payments received of $26.7 million during the same period in 2009, causing an increase in cash from operations of $17.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $865.9 billion, a decrease of $202.4 million from the $1.1 billion generated in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P156_S1	The decrease included $144.9 million from the cash provided by the operating activities of PSE as previously discussed.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P156_S2	Other factors contributing to the decrease included the following:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	As a result of the merger, $371.6 million in derivative settlement payments were reclassified to financing activities during the year ended 2010 as compared to $524.4 million during the same period in 2009, resulting in a decrease in operating cash flows of $152.8 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	These contracts represent proceeds received from derivative instruments that included financing elements at the merger date.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	Puget Energy made $89.5 million less net payments on accounts payable during the year ended 2010 as compared to the year ended 2009, causing an increase in cash from operations.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, PSE had $247.0 million and $105.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P162_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowing under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P162_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2010 and 2009 was 5.11%, and 3.59%, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P162_S3	As of December 31, 2010, PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	PSE maintains three committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that provide, in the aggregate, $1.15 billion in short-term borrowing capability and which mature concurrently in February 2014.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	These facilities consist of a $400.0 million credit agreement for working capital needs, a $400.0 million credit facility for funding capital expenditures and a $350.0 million facility to support energy hedging activities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	PSE s credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	The credit agreements also contain financial covenants which include a cash flow interest coverage ratio and, in addition, if PSE has a below investment grade credit rating, a cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio (each as specified in the facilities).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P164_S2	PSE certifies its compliance with these covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P164_S3	As of December 31, 2010, PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	These credit facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed lenders.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	The agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and include variable fee levels.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S2	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank s prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon PSE s credit rating.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S3	The $400.0 million working capital facility and $350.0 million credit agreement to support energy hedging allow for issuing standby letters of credit.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S4	PSE must also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S5	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE s credit ratings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S6	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 0.85% and the commitment fee is 0.26%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P165_S7	The $400.0 million working capital facility also serves as a backstop for PSE s commercial paper program.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	In May 2010, PSE s credit facilities were amended, in part, to include a swing line feature allowing same day availability on such borrowings up to $50.0 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P166_S1	This feature does not increase the total lending commitments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	As of December 31, 2010, $247.0 million was drawn and outstanding under PSE s $400.0 million capital expenditure facility in addition to a $12.6 million letter of credit supporting the BPA contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	No loans were outstanding under PSE s working capital facility and no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under PSE s $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging activities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P167_S2	Outside of the credit agreements, PSE had a $5.7 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P168_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P168_S3	At December 31, 2010, the outstanding balance of the Note was $22.6 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P168_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	Effective with the close of the merger on February 6, 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five-year term-loan and a $1.0 billion credit facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	On December 6, 2010, Puget Energy issued $450.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S2	The net proceeds of $443.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the $1.225 billion five-year term-loan.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S3	Concurrent with the repayment of the term-loan, Puget Energy expensed $7.2 million of the loan s unamortized discount and issuance costs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S4	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had fully drawn the five-year term-loan which had a remaining outstanding balance of $782.0 million and had drawn $258.0 million under the $1.0 billion facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S5	The term-loan and facility mature in February 2014.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S6	These credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants which are similar to PSE s credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S7	Puget Energy s credit agreements contain financial covenants based on the following three ratios: cash flow interest coverage, cash flow to net debt outstanding and debt service coverage (cash available for debt service to borrower interest), each as specified in the facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S8	Puget Energy certifies its compliance with these covenants each quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P169_S9	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	In May 2010, Puget Energy s credit facilities were amended, in part, to include a provision for the sharing of collateral with future note holders when notes are issued to repay and reduce the size of the credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	These facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed lenders.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	The agreements provide Puget Energy with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and include variable fee levels.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S2	Borrowings may be at the banks prime rate or at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a spread based upon Puget Energy s credit rating.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S3	Puget Energy must also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the $1.0 billion facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S4	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on Puget Energy s credit ratings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P171_S5	As of the date of this report, the spread over prime rate is 1.25%, the spread to the LIBOR is 2.25% and the commitment fee is 0.84%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	In February 2011, Puget Energy borrowed an additional $175.0 million under the $1.0 billion credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P173_S1	The new legislation established a framework for the regulation of certain over-the-counter derivative contracts which are used for hedging and trading.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P173_S2	The legislation could expand collateral requirements of derivative contracts which may make it more costly for companies.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P173_S3	The Company is evaluating the new legislation to determine its impact, if any, on the Company s hedging program, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P173_S4	The Company will not know the full impact of the new legislation until the regulations are finalized.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	At December 31, 2010, approximately $416.7 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P175_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P175_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 46.5% at December 31, 2010 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 3.9 to one.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities pursuant to which, PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P177_S1	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than two to one.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P177_S2	At December 31, 2010, the EBITDA to interest expense was 2.7 to one.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	In accordance with terms of the Puget Energy credit facilities, Puget Energy is limited to paying a dividend within an eight business-day period that begins seven business days following the delivery of quarterly or annual financial statements to the facility agent.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P178_S1	Puget Energy is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P178_S2	In addition, in order to declare or pay unrestricted dividends, Puget Energy s interest coverage ratio may not be less than 1.5 to one and its cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio may not be less than 8.25% for the 12 months ending each quarter-end.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P178_S3	Puget Energy is also subject to other restrictions such as a lock up provision that, in certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain cash flow tests, may further restrict Puget Energy's ability to pay dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	The type and amount of future long-term financing for Puget Energy and PSE are limited by provisions in their credit agreements, restated articles of incorporation and PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P180_S1	Under its credit agreements, Puget Energy is generally limited to permitted refinancings and borrowings under its credit facilities and by restrictions placed upon its subsidiaries.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P180_S2	One such restriction limits PSE s long-term debt issuances to not exceed $500.0 million per year, plus any amount needed to refinance maturing bonds.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P180_S3	Unused amounts under this limitation may be carried forward into future years.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	Puget Energy s facilities contain a provision whereby additional capital expenditure loans up to $750.0 million may, under certain conditions, be made available after the $1.0 billion capital expenditure commitment has been fully borrowed.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P182_S1	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2010, PSE could issue:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P183_S0	approximately $168.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $280.0 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P184_S0	At December 31, 2010, PSE had approximately $5.7 billion in electric and natural gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P185_S0	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P186_S0	On June 29, 2010, PSE issued $250.0 million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P186_S1	The notes have a term of 30 years and an interest rate of 5.764%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P186_S2	Net proceeds from the note offering were used to repay $7.0 million of medium-term notes with a 7.12% interest rate that matured on September 13, 2010 and to repay short-term debt outstanding under the $400.0 million capital expenditure credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P187_S0	On March 8, 2010, PSE issued $325.0 million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P187_S1	The notes have a term of 30 years and an interest rate of 5.795%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P187_S2	Net proceeds from the offering were used to replenish funds utilized to repay $225.0 million of senior medium-term notes which matured on February 22, 2010 and carried a 7.96% interest rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P187_S3	Remaining net proceeds were used to pay down debt under PSE s capital expenditure credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P188_S0	On December 6, 2010, Puget Energy issued $450.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P188_S1	The notes have a term of ten years and an interest rate of 6.5%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P188_S2	The notes are secured by an interest in substantially all of Puget Energy s assets, which consists mainly of all the issued and outstanding stock of PSE and the stock of Puget Energy held by Puget Equico.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P188_S3	The notes contain a change of control provision pursuant to which holders of the notes may have the right to require Puget Energy to repurchase all or any part of the notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P188_S4	Net proceeds from the issue of the notes were used to repay a portion of the $1.225 billion Puget Energy five-year term-loan.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P189_S0	The Howard Hanson Dam (Dam), located on the upper reach of the Green-Duwamish River, provides flood risk reduction for the benefit of the Green River Valley of south King County.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P190_S0	Formerly an agricultural area, the Green River Valley now is home to substantial residential, commercial and industrial development in such communities as Auburn, Kent, Renton, South Seattle and Tukwila, all of which are within PSE s natural gas and electric service territories.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P190_S1	In addition to many natural gas and electric customers, the area is home to critical PSE infrastructure, including transmission substations, distribution systems, and key operational facilities housing.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P191_S0	In January 2009, heavy rains damaged a section of the Dam and resulted in the Corps deciding in July 2009 to reduce the Dam s flood storage capacity, pending the completion of improvements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	Due to this reduced capacity, there is an increased risk to downstream communities for higher flood levels during storm seasons, according to the Corps.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P191_S2	PSE is working closely with the Corps, King County, the many affected jurisdictions, and other agencies in preparing for the possibility of flooding, potentially multiple times, that could disrupt service to tens of thousands of electric and natural gas customers and damage substantial PSE infrastructure.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P191_S3	Should a flood or floods in the Green River Valley occur, PSE could incur both significant costs responding to the event and repairing any damage it creates, as well as the loss of revenue from affected customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	On January 28, 2010, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request for authorization to defer the costs associated with restoring the Company s infrastructure, facilitating public safety, and repairing the Company s electric and natural gas system in the Green River Valley flood plain in the event evacuation is required or flooding occurs due to operations associated with the Dam.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P192_S1	This authorization is conditioned on PSE incurring incremental operation and maintenance costs in excess of $5.0 million per year associated with repair or restoration of the Company s systems around the Green River.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P192_S2	The Washington Commission s order will be effective until the date the Corps confirms that the Dam has been permanently repaired and that Corps operations will return to normal.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P193_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P193_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which include estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S1	Unbilled revenue is determined by taking MWh generated and purchased less estimated system losses and billed MWh plus unbilled MWh balance at the last true-up date.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S2	The estimated system loss percentage for electricity is determined by reviewing historical billed MWh to generated and purchased MWh.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S3	The estimated unbilled MWh balance is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per MWh.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S4	Unbilled natural gas revenue is determined by taking therms delivered to PSE less estimated system losses, prior month unbilled therms and billed therms.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S5	The estimated system loss percentage for natural gas is determined by reviewing historical billed therms to therms delivered to customers, which vary little from year to year.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P194_S6	The estimated current month unbilled therms is then multiplied by estimated average rate schedule revenue per therm.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P195_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P195_S1	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P196_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P196_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 in the amount of $887.6 million and $296.9 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009 of $867.7 million and $300.2 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P196_S2	In conjunction with the merger, Puget Energy recognized additional regulatory assets of $297.1 million and liabilities of $1.05 billion, reflecting the regulatory treatment of certain assets and liabilities subject to purchase accounting.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P196_S3	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P197_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P197_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P197_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, Puget Energy could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P198_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P199_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P199_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 1 Business Regulation and Rates Electric Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P200_S0	The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P200_S1	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P200_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P201_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P201_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P202_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P202_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P203_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P204_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P205_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P206_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P206_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P206_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P206_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P207_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P208_S0	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P209_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P209_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P210_S0	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $3.7 billion at the October 1, 2010 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P210_S1	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.2 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 14.0%.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P211_S0	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $3.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P211_S1	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 7.1% respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P212_S0	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_11_ITEM7_P213_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P213_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P213_S2	The majority of PSE s physical contracts qualify for the NPNS exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P213_S3	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P213_S4	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P214_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P214_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P215_S0	Energy and financial contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P215_S1	If a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in its market value of the effective portion of the hedge is generally deferred as a component of OCI until the transaction it is hedging is completed.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P215_S2	Conversely, the change in the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current period earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P216_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P216_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P216_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P216_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P216_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P217_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P217_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P217_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P218_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P219_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P219_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P219_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P219_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P220_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P220_S1	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P220_S2	Using net proceeds from a ten-year debt issuance settling on December 6, 2010, Puget Energy repaid a portion of its outstanding variable rate loans within its existing interest rate cash flow hedge, essentially refinancing a portion of these loans.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P220_S3	Since the terms of the December 6, 2010 debt issuance were different than the existing variable rate debt issued February 6, 2009 (fixed versus variable) Puget Energy was unable to replace the original hedged item with additional variable rate debt within the context of the cash flow hedge.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P220_S4	For additional information, see Item 7A and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P221_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defined fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P221_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P221_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P221_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P222_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P222_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P222_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P223_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P223_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in a recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P223_S2	For the discussion of purchase accounting adjustments, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P224_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P224_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $8.0 million, expense of $3.3 million and income of $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P224_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 61.1%, 61.2% and 60.0% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P224_S3	Due to the merger, the pension plan was remeasured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P224_S4	For further information on the business combination, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P225_S0	For the year ending December 31, 2010, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension expense of $3.0 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P225_S1	In 2011, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $7.7 million and $2.4 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P226_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_11_ITEM7_P226_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.5 million, $4.9 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P226_S2	Due to the merger, the SERP plan was remeasured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P226_S3	For further information on the business combination, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P227_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $1.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P227_S1	In 2011, it is expected PSE and Puget Energy will recognize $5.2 million of pension expense and $1.4 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P228_S0	PSE has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P228_S1	PSE recognized expense of $0.1 million, expense of $0.3 million and income of $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P228_S2	Due to the merger, the other postretirement benefit plans were remeasured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P229_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.3 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P229_S1	For further information on the business combination, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P230_S0	In 2011, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize expense of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P231_S0	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P231_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P232_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P232_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P232_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P232_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P233_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P233_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P234_S0	During 2010, the Company made a cash contribution of $12.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P234_S1	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P234_S2	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2011 are expected to be at least $5.0 million, $3.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7_P235_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_11_ITEM7_P236_S0	For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE is focused on the commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios and related effects noted above.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The objectives of the hedging strategy are to:
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Meet the credit, liquidity, financing, tax and accounting requirements of PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	ASC 815 requires a significant amount of disclosure regarding PSE s derivative activities and the nature of such derivatives impact on PSE s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The information in this Item 7A should serve as an accompaniment to Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	PSE employs various portfolio optimization strategies but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	PSE s portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its retail electric customers to volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	PSE s natural gas retail customers are served by natural gas purchase contracts which expose PSE s customers to commodity price risks through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	All purchased natural gas costs are recovered through customer rates with no direct impact on PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Therefore, wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing PSE s energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible and reducing volatility.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S5	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S6	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electricity and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, and floating for fixed swap contracts that are related to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P4_S7	The forward physical electricity contracts are both fixed and variable (at index) while the physical natural gas contracts are variable with investment grade counterparties that do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	To fix the price of natural gas, PSE may enter into natural gas floating for fixed swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P6_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The following tables present the Company s energy derivatives instruments that do not meet the NPNS exception at December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings and OCI (for cash flow hedges), see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company had total assets of $6.0 million and total liabilities of $155.7 million related to financial contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical natural gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P9_S1	All fair value adjustments of derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P9_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P9_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $112.2 million, with an after-tax impact of $72.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2009 through December 31, 2010 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2010, based on price source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Pricing inputs are based on observable market data.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Pricing derived from inputs with internally developed methodologies.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Pricing inputs are generally less observable than objective sources.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P16_S0	PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P17_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Where deemed appropriate, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P18_S1	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P18_S2	As of December 31, 2010, PSE held approximately $11.1 million worth of standby letters of credit in support of various electricity and REC transactions.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P19_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P19_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P19_S2	However, as of December 31, 2010, approximately 92.2% of PSE s energy and natural gas portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 7.8% of PSE s portfolio are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P19_S3	PSE assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P20_S0	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P20_S1	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements - standardized power sales contracts in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements - standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements - standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P20_S2	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the risk of default by allowing a counterparty the ability to make only one net payment.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P21_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P21_S1	Counterparty credit risk impacts PSE s decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P21_S2	A counterparty may have a deterioration of credit below investment grade, potentially indicating that it is no longer probable that it will fulfill its obligations under a contract (e.g., make a physical delivery upon the contract s maturity).
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P22_S0	ASC 815 specifies the requirements for derivative contracts to qualify for the NPNS scope exception.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P23_S0	When performance is no longer probable, PSE records the fair value of the contract on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded in the statements of income.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P24_S0	Accumulated OCI related to cash flow hedges is also impacted by a counterparty s deterioration of credit under ASC 815 guidelines.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P24_S1	If a forecasted transaction associated with the cash flow hedge is probable of not occurring, PSE will reclassify the amounts deferred in accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P25_S0	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P25_S1	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P26_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P27_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e. WSPP, ISDA or NAESB).
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P27_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P27_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P27_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P28_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P28_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and coming up with an average value.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P28_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P29_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P29_S1	Moreover, the Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P30_S0	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of taking into account credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of their counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P30_S2	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P30_S3	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P31_S0	The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, commercial paper and credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S2	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S3	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its debt.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S4	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had seven interest rate swap contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of $1.483 billion.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S5	The interest rate swaps hedge the exposure of the five-year variable rate debt which Puget Energy was holding in 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P32_S6	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P33_S0	Using net proceeds from a ten-year debt issuance settling on December 6, 2010, Puget Energy repaid $443.0 million of the $1.483 billion of its outstanding variable rate loans within its existing interest rate cash flow hedge, essentially refinancing a portion of these loans.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P33_S1	Since the terms of the December 6, 2010 debt issuance were different than the existing variable rate debt issued February 6, 2009 (fixed rate versus variable rate), Puget Energy was unable to replace the original hedged item with the additional variable rate debt within the context of the cash flow hedge.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P34_S0	The purpose of refinancing Puget Energy s variable rate loans is to stagger the maturity dates of the original $1.483 billion of borrowings which mature on February 6, 2014.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P34_S1	The Company intends to refinance a portion of the remaining $1.040 billion of outstanding variable rate debt ($1.483 billion less $443.0 million) over the next few years in order to further stagger debt maturity dates.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P34_S2	This refinancing approach is supported in the Company s five-year financial plan and was implemented to satisfy a commitment the Company made to the Washington Commission and to mitigate refinancing risk.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P35_S0	The Company s current intent is to continue to refinance the remaining portion of the $1.040 billion in variable rate debt within the cash flow hedging relationship, as evidenced by the five-year financial plan, which establishes a pattern of determining that the forecasted transactions (forecasted future interest payments on the underlying debt) are probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P36_S0	Because management concluded the forecasted future interest payments were no longer probable of occurring in all future periods, Puget Energy de-designated the cash flow hedging relationship on the entire $1.483 billion of interest rate swaps, effective December 6, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P36_S1	The outstanding interest rate derivative loss on December 6, 2010, of $61.8 million, was recorded in OCI and will be amortized as the future interest payments on the debt occur.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P36_S2	In addition, the forecasted transactions related to the $443.0 million repayment were determined to be remote of occurring and as a result, management reclassified a $7.3 million loss to other deductions in December 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P37_S0	Going forward, all gains or losses associated with the interest rate swaps will be marked-to-market and recorded in earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P37_S1	Puget Energy recorded a $10.9 million gain related to the swaps to interest expense during 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had not unwound or terminated any of the swaps corresponding to the de-designated cash flow hedge.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P37_S3	A portion of those swaps mayremain un-hedged (not linked to any debt) until December 6, 2011 or the Company may unwind or follow other strategies to mitigate the risk of these open positions.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P37_S4	During the period which these swaps remain un-hedged, the Company will be subject to additional interest rate risk.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P38_S0	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the one-month LIBOR would change the fair value of the interest rate swaps remaining in a cash flow hedge relationship by $5.6 million, or $3.6 million after tax, recorded in accumulated OCI.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P39_S0	As a result of the cash flow hedge de-designation related to its interest rate swaps, the Company is exposed to additional interest rate risk on the portion of swaps that remain unhedged.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P39_S1	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the three-month LIBOR would change the fair value of these specific unhedged swaps by $0.7 million.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P39_S2	This hypothetical change in fair value would directly impact earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P40_S0	The following table presents Puget Energy s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2010 and 2009:

1085392_11_ITEM7A_P45_S0	From time to time PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P45_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2010 is a net loss of $7.3 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P45_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $7.6 million in OCI as of December 31, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P46_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Asset Management Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_11_ITEM7A_P46_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P48_S1	After February 6, 2009, non-utility property, plant and equipment are capitalized at original costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P49_S1	Amortization is comprised of intangibles such as computer software and franchises.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P49_S2	The depreciation of automobiles, trucks, power-operated equipment, tools and office equipment is allocated to asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P49_S3	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.7%, 2.6% and 2.8% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; depreciable gas utility plant was 3.6%, 3.6% and 3.4% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively; and depreciable common utility plant was 11.8%, 9.6% and 5.8% in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P52_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P56_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2010 using an October 1, 2010 measurement date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P58_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P58_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	Changes in these estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P59_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P59_S4	There were no events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2010 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	Cash equivalents are reported at cost, which approximates fair value, and were $20.6 and $44.3 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	Restricted cash represents cash to be used for specific purposes.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	The restricted cash balance was $5.5 million and $19.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P61_S2	The restricted cash balance in both 2010 and 2009 includes $0.7 million, and $0.8 million which represents funds held by Puget Western, Inc., a PSE subsidiary, for a real estate development project.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P61_S3	As of December 31, 2010, other restricted cash includes $3.2 in a Benefit Protection Trust, and $1.6 million in other restricted cash accounts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	PSE records these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of materials and supplies to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	Additionally, materials and supplies include emission allowances, Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and carbon financials instruments recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	After February 6, 2009, items are recorded at weighted-average cost.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	Fuel and gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P64_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P64_S2	Gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P64_S3	PSE records these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	For Puget Energy, the carrying amount of fuel and gas inventory was remeasured to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	After February 6, 2009, additional inventory are recorded at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it were probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P66_S2	It similarly requires deferral requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P66_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term assets or liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P67_S1	The exception is the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) which is a current asset.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	Below is a chart with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and times periods associated.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and 2009 included the following:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) rate proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	Amortization will begin in November 2011 for a 20-year period.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	For additional information, see Note 3.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $193.8 million and $173.4 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P76_S1	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	The AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending principally upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	The authorized AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) for natural gas and electric utility plant additions based on the effective dates is as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P80_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	The following table presents the AFUDC amounts:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered which include estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	Sales to other utilities are recognized in accordance with ASC 605 Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	Non-utility subsidiaries recognize revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	Sales of RECs are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	PSE collected Washington state excise taxes (which are a component of general retail rates) and municipal taxes totaling $231.1 million, $247.8 million and $240.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Company s policy is to report such taxes on a gross basis in operating revenue and taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable as compared to operating revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	Other non-energy receivable balances are reserved in the allowance account based on facts and circumstances surrounding the receivable including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk, indicating some or all of the balance is uncollectible.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P85_S3	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $9.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	PSE currently has no insurance coverage for storm damage and recent environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	PSE is self-insured for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured storm damage costs that exceed $7.0 million for the years ending 2006 through 2008 and $8.0 million for subsequent years of qualifying storm damage costs for collection in future rates if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	For Puget Energy and PSE s separate financial statement purposes, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company level.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P89_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	Puget Energy and PSE provide for deferred taxes on certain assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes, as required by ASC 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	Uncertain tax positions are also accounted for under ASC 740.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Company reports interest in interest expense and penalties in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity varies from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	All significant variable power supply cost drivers are included in the PCA mechanism (hydroelectric generation variability, market price variability for purchased power and surplus power sales, natural gas and coal fuel price variability, generation unit forced outage risk and wheeling cost variability).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a graduated scale, between PSE and its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	Any unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), are deferred in proportion to the cost-sharing arrangement under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	On January 10, 2007, the Washington Commission approved the PCA mechanism with the same annual graduated scale but without a cap on excess power costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the annual power costs variability was between $20.0 million and $40.0 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P96_S1	Accordingly, PSE and the customer share the costs in excess of $20.0 million in equal proportion.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	The differences between the actual cost of PSE s natural gas supplies and natural gas transportation contracts and costs currently allowed by the Washington Commission are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected gas costs, and defer, as a receivable or liability, any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in the PGA mechanism rates, including interest.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P98_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE provides natural gas to an electric supplier and to its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P99_S3	The net proceeds from such activities are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to companies that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	Prior to July 1, 2010, PTCs that were generated were passed-through to customers in retail sales.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P100_S2	After July 1, 2010, PTCs which are generated and owed to customers are recorded as a regulatory liability with a corresponding reduction in electric operating revenue until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return, at which time the PTCs will be credited to customers in retail sales.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	The majority of PSE s physical contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P104_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	For additional information, see Note 10.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P107_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P108_S1	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Company applies the fair value approach to stock compensation and estimates fair value in accordance with provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	Effective February 6, 2009, as a result of the merger, all outstanding shares of the Company were accelerated and vested, the stock compensation plan was terminated and there was no stock-based compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P110_S2	The Company recognized $14.5 million of stock compensation expense which was recorded in merger and related costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P111_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	PSE funds cash dividends paid to the shareholders of Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P112_S1	These funds are reflected in the statement of cash flows of Puget Energy as if Puget Energy received the cash from PSE and paid the dividends directly to the shareholders.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	The following non-cash investing and financing activities have occurred at the Company:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	In connection with the February 6, 2009 merger, Puget Energy assumed $779.3 million of long-term debt in order to pay down PSE short-term debt and assumed $587.8 million of long-term debt to pay off the previous shareholders.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P114_S1	This amount was included as part of the purchase price consideration.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	The following tables set forth the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	On January 1, 2009, Puget Energy adopted ASC 805, Business Combinations.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	The objective of the standard is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	To accomplish that, the standard establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P116_S3	For additional information, see Note 3.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-6, Improving Disclosures About Fair Value Measurements (ASU 2010-6), which requires new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of Level 2 fair value measurements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	ASU 2010-6 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the Level 3 reconciliation disclosures, which were effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P117_S2	As these new requirements relate solely to disclosures, the adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P118_S2	For additional information, see Note 3.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its equivalent).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P119_S1	The standard allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P119_S2	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P119_S3	The Company adopted the standard as of December 31, 2009, and such adoption did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P119_S4	For additional information, see Note 16.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted ASC 820 for all financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P120_S1	The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P120_S2	This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company adopted ASC 820 on January 1, 2008, prospectively, for financial and nonfinancial instruments measured on a recurring basis, with certain exceptions, including the initial impact of changes in fair value measurements of existing derivative financial instruments measured initially using the transaction price under ASC 815.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P121_S1	The difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of those instruments originally recorded under guidance in ASC 815 was recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of $9.0 million before tax as a result of recording a deferred loss on net derivative assets and liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	In January 2009, the Company adopted ASC 820 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	The application of the fair value measurement guidance to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and nonrecurring nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis did not impact the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of GAAP.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	With this ASU, the FASB Codification became the authoritative source of GAAP.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P123_S2	The FASB Codification was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009, which was September 30, 2009 for the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P123_S3	The FASB Codification did not have a material impact on the financial reporting of the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	In January 2009, FASB issued a new standard, which required additional disclosures about the Company s objectives in using derivative instruments and hedging activities, and tabular disclosures of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on the Company s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	For additional information, see Note 13.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	Effective December 31, 2009, ASC 715 Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P125_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P125_S2	For additional information, see Note 16.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	In May 2009, FASB issued ASC 855, Subsequent Events, a new standard on subsequent events.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The standard does not require significant changes regarding recognition or disclosure of subsequent events but does require disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated for disclosure and recognition.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	The standard is effective for financial statements issued after June 15, 2009, which was the quarter ended June 30, 2009 for the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P126_S3	The implementation of this standard did not have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-17, Topic 810, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which amended the FASB ASC for the issuance of pre-codification FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S1	This standard replaces the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S2	An approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and: (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity; or (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S3	An approach that is primarily qualitative is expected to be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S4	This standard also requires additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in VIE relationships.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P127_S5	The Company adopted the standard as of January 1, 2010, which did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P128_S1	As a result of the merger, Puget Energy is the direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Equico, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P128_S2	After the merger, Puget Energy has 1,000 shares authorized, of which 200 shares have been issued at a par value of $0.01 per share.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	At the time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Puget Energy was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	The fair value of consideration transferred was $3.9 billion, including funding by Puget Holdings of $3.0 billion, debt of $0.6 billion issued by Puget Energy and $0.3 billion that was the result of the stepped-up basis of the investors previously owned shares.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	The table below is the statement of fair value of assets acquired and accrued liabilities assumed as of February 6, 2009 measured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P130_S1	There were no adjustments subsequent to the merger transaction date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	The following tables present the fair value adjustments to Puget Energy s balance sheet and recognition of goodwill in accordance with ASC 805:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	The carrying values of net utility plant and the majority of regulatory assets and liabilities were determined to be stated at fair value at the acquisition date based on a conclusion that individual assets are subject to regulation by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	As a result, the future cash flows associated with the assets are limited to the carrying value plus a return, and management believes that a market participant would not expect to recover any more or less than the carrying value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P132_S2	Furthermore, management believes that the current rate of return on plant assets is consistent with an amount that market participants would expect.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	ASC 805 requires that the beginning balance of fixed depreciable assets be shown net, with no accumulated amortization recorded, at the date of acquisition, consistent with fresh start accounting.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	Other property and investments includes the carrying value of the investments in PSE subsidiaries and other non-utility assets adjusted to fair value based on a combination of the income approach, the market based approach and the cost approach.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	The fair values of materials and supplies, which included emission allowances, RECs and carbon financial instruments, were established using a variety of approaches to estimate the market price.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P135_S1	The carrying value of fuel inventory was adjusted to its fair value by applying market cost at the date of acquisition.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	Energy derivative contracts were reassessed and revalued at the merger date based on forward market prices and forecasted energy requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating nonperformance risk.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	The fair value of the power contracts will be amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	Other regulatory assets include service contracts which were valued using the income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate over the remaining period of the contract.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	The fair value of leases was determined using the income approach which calculated the favorable/unfavorable leasehold interests as the net present value of the difference between the contract lease rent and market lease rent over the remaining terms of the contracted lease obligation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P141_S0	The fair value assigned to long-term debt was determined using two different methodologies.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P142_S0	For those securities which were quoted by a third party pricing service based on observable market data, the best indication of fair value was assumed to be the third party s quoted price.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P142_S1	For those securities for which the third party did not provide regular pricing, the fair value of the debt was estimated by forecasting out all coupon and principal payments and discounting them to the present value at an approximated discount rate based on PSE s risk of nonperformance as of the merger date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P143_S0	The merger also triggered a new basis of accounting for Puget Energy s postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PSE under ASC 805 which required remeasuring plan liabilities without the five year smoothing of market-related asset gains and losses.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P144_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, Puget Energy incurred pre-tax merger expenses of $47.1 million primarily related to legal fees, transaction advisory services, new credit facility fees, change of control provisions and real estate excise tax.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P144_S1	Puget Energy s merger costs in 2009 are not indicative for periods following the acquisition.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P145_S0	One day prior to the merger, PSE defeased its preferred stock in the amount of $1.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P145_S1	In conjunction with the merger on February 6, 2009, Puget Energy contributed $805.3 million in capital to PSE, of which $779.3 million was used to pay off short-term debt owed by PSE, including $188.0 million in short-term debt outstanding through the PSE Funding accounts receivable securitization program that was terminated upon closing of the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P145_S2	An additional $26.0 million of the capital contribution was used to pay change in control costs associated with the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Washington Commission issued a general rate case order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P147_S0	PSE s storm accounting, which allows deferral of certain storm damage costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	In 2010 and 2009, PSE incurred $23.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $14.0 million was deferred in 2010 and none in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P148_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P148_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P149_S0	On October 8, 2008, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s electric general rate case filed in December 2007, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $130.2 million or 7.1% annually.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P149_S1	The rate increase for electric customers was effective November 1, 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P149_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.25% , or 7.00% after-tax, and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with a return on equity of 10.15%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P150_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), a limited-scope proceeding, was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P150_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P150_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission approved an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a general rate case.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P151_S0	On May 21, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that authorizes the deferral of a settlement payment of $10.7 million incurred as a result of the recent settlement of a lawsuit in the state of Montana over alleged damages caused by the operation of the Colstrip Montana coal-fired steam electric generation facility (Colstrip).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P151_S1	The payment was expensed pending resolution of the accounting petition.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P151_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission allowed recovery of $8.4 million in PSE s operating costs, which represents the amount of the settlement, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P152_S0	On November 5, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing the deferral and recovery of interest due the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2001 to 2006 along with carrying costs incurred in connection with the interest due.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	In October 2005, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing the deferral and recovery of costs associated with increased borrowings necessary to remit deferred taxes to the IRS.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P153_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission denied recovery of the interest due to the IRS.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P153_S2	PSE expensed the interest deferral of $6.9 million in April 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	On November 6, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing accounting treatment and amortization related to payments received for taking assignment of Westcoast Pipeline Capacity.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P154_S1	The accounting petition seeks deferred accounting treatment and amortization of the regulatory liability to power costs beginning in November 2009 and extending over the remaining primary term of the pipeline capacity contract through October 31, 2018.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P154_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the deferral of $7.5 million and amortization as proposed.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	On December 30, 2008, the Washington Commission approved an order authorizing the sale of Puget Energy and PSE to Puget Holdings subject to a Settlement Stipulation which included 78 conditions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P155_S1	Items included in the conditions that may affect the financial statements are dividend restrictions for Puget Energy and PSE which are discussed in Note 6.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P155_S2	In addition, the conditions provided for rate credits of $10.0 million per year (less certain merger savings) over a ten-year period beginning at the closing of the transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P156_S0	On April 17, 2009, the Washington Commission issued an order approving and adopting a settlement agreement that authorized PSE to defer certain ownership and operating costs related to its purchase of the Mint Farm Electric Generating Station (Mint Farm) that were incurred prior to PSE recovering such costs in electric customer rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P157_S0	Under Washington state law, a jurisdictional electric utility may defer the costs associated with purchasing and operating a natural gas plant that complies with the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performance standard until the plant is included in rates or for two years from the date of purchase, whichever occurs sooner.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P157_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the prudence of the Mint Farm acquisition and recovery of the deferred costs from the plant s in-service date to the date of the order.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P157_S2	The deferred costs are to be amortized over 15 years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P157_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the balance of the regulatory asset, net of amortization was $28.3 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P158_S0	On March 13, 2009, PSE filed with the Washington Commission an application for authority to sell and transfer certain assets related to the Company s White River Hydroelectric Project (the Project) to the Cascade Water Alliance (CWA).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	PSE also requested in its application that the Washington Commission waive applicable provisions of the Revised Code of Washington and Washington Administrative Code with regard to certain surplus property related to the Project, which PSE expects to sell in the near future but which is not part of the CWA transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P158_S2	On May 14, 2009, the application for authority to transfer certain assets to CWA was approved by the Washington Commission and the application for waiver with regard to the Surplus Property was denied and requires PSE to seek approval prior to the sale of any property.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	On September 30, 2009, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission authorize PSE to normalize over 10 years a Treasury grant of $28.7 million received under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 associated with the Wild Horse expansion project.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P159_S1	Treasury grants are tax free grants related to certain renewable energy infrastructure that are available in lieu of the PTC allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P159_S2	The Washington Commission issued an order approving the accounting petition on December 10, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	On October 16, 2009, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission authorize the deferral and recovery of incremental costs associated with protecting the Company s infrastructure, facilitating public safety, and preparing PSE s electric and natural gas system in the Green River Valley flood plain in anticipation of release of water from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Howard Hanson Dam (Dam).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	In the event of actual flooding, PSE also petitioned the Washington Commission to allow the deferral of costs associated with the repair and restoration of any electric and gas system infrastructure affected by a flood.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P161_S0	On January 28, 2010, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request for authorization to defer the costs associated with restoring the Company s infrastructure, facilitating public safety, and repairing the Company s electric and natural gas system in the Green River Valley flood plain in the event evacuation is required or flooding occurs due to operations associated with the Dam.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P161_S1	This authorization is conditioned on PSE incurring incremental operation and maintenance costs in excess of $5.0 million per year associated with repair or restoration of the Company s systems around the Green River.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P161_S2	The Washington Commission s order will be effective until the date the Corps confirms that the Dam has been permanently repaired and that Corps operations will return to normal.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how REC proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P162_S1	The order required REC proceeds to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest at a rate to be determined in a later filing.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P163_S0	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for the use of $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P163_S1	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company s RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE s approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P165_S1	The petition is still pending approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P166_S0	PSE has a tariff which passes the benefits of the PTCs to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P166_S1	The tariff is not subject to the sharing bands in the PCA.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P167_S0	Prior to July 1, 2010, PSE could adjust the PTC tariff annually based on differences between the PTC credits provided to the customers and the PTC credits actually earned, plus estimated PTC credits for the following year, less interest associated with the deferred tax balance for the PTC credits.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P167_S1	Since customers received the benefit of the tax credits as they were generated and the Company did not receive a credit from the IRS until the tax credits were utilized, the Company will be reimbursed for its carrying costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P167_S2	PSE will continue to be reimbursed for carrying costs through December 31, 2011 when the credits that were provided and not used will be received from customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P168_S0	Effective July 1, 2010, the Washington Commission approved a change in PSE s PTC tariff as PSE has not been able to utilize PTCs since 2007, due to insufficient taxable income caused primarily by bonus tax depreciation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P168_S1	The Washington Commission approved PSE suspending its PTC tariff, effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P168_S2	This resulted in an overall increase in PSE s electric rates of 1.7%, however, this will not result in an increase in earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S0	On September 22, 2010, a joint proposal and accounting petition was filed with the Washington Commission by PSE, Washington Commission Staff and Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities which addressed how to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addresses REC proceeds to be returned to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S1	On October 26, 2010, the Washington Commission issued an order granting the joint proposal and accounting petition.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S2	The order allows the Company to credit customers for REC revenue received and deferred through November 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S3	This credit will reduce rates by $27.7 million, or 2.5%, over five months beginning November 2010 through March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S4	RECs received after November 2009 will be retained by PSE and will be used to recapture the benefit of PTCs previously provided to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P169_S5	Once these PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return, the customers will receive the benefit.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P170_S0	Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (Section 1603) authorizes the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) to make grants to corporations who place specified energy property in service provided certain conditions are met.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P170_S1	The Wild Horse expansion facility was placed into service on November 9, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P170_S2	The Wild Horse facility was expanded from 229 megawatts (MW) to 273 MW through the addition of wind turbines.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P170_S3	On December 22, 2009, PSE filed an application with the U.S. Treasury to request a grant on the expansion in the amount of $28.7 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P171_S0	Section 1603 precludes a recipient from claiming PTCs on property for which a grant is claimed.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P171_S1	On February 19, 2010, the U.S. Treasury approved the grant and payment was received in February 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S0	On December 30, 2010, the Washington Commission approved revisions to PSE s PTC tariff, effective January 1, 2011, which changed the methodology by which PTCs are passed-through to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S1	Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of PTCs, the PTCs will pass-through to customers following the year in which they are able to be utilized on PSE s tax return, rather than in the same year in which they are generated by qualifying wind powered facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S2	The rate schedule will pass-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million treasury grant in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S3	The order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the treasury grant on an annual basis and includes 23 months of treasury grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represents the month the treasury grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S4	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P172_S5	Since the tariff now addresses additional federal incentives, it has been renamed the Federal Incentive Tracker.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P173_S0	In 2002, the Washington Commission approved a PCA mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity varies from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P173_S1	On January 10, 2007, the Washington Commission approved the continuation of the PCA mechanism under the same annual graduated scale but without a cap on excess power costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P174_S0	All significant variable power supply cost variables (hydroelectric and wind generation, market price for purchased power and surplus power, natural gas and coal fuel price, generation unit forced outage risk and transmission cost) are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P175_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a calendar year basis, between PSE and its customers on a graduated scale.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P175_S1	For a discussion of the accounting policy and PCA graduated scale, see Note 1.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P176_S0	On October 1, 2010, PSE filed a natural gas tariff filing with the Washington Commission to implement changes to natural gas rates that would result in an overall increase in revenue of $24.4 million and a customer rate increase of 2.3%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P176_S1	The parties to the proceedings have agreed upon a settlement of $19.0 million with a recommended effective date of April 1, 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P176_S2	A Washington Commission order is expected in March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P177_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually or $10.1 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P177_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P178_S0	On October 8, 2008, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in December 2007, approving a general rate increase for natural gas rates of $49.2 million, or 4.6% annually.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P178_S1	The rate increases for natural gas customers were effective November 1, 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P178_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.25%, or 7.00% after tax, and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with a return on equity of 10.15%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following table sets for PGA rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	On October 23, 2000, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a Right) for each outstanding common share of Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P181_S1	The dividend was paid on December 29, 2000 to shareholders of record on that date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P181_S2	The Rights were to become exercisable only if a person or group acquired 10.0% or more of Puget Energy s outstanding common stock or announced a tender offer which, if consummated, would have resulted in ownership by a person or group of 10.0% or more of the outstanding common stock.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P181_S3	Each Right entitled the holder to purchase from Puget Energy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock with economic terms similar to that of one share of Puget Energy s common stock at a purchase price of $65.00, subject to adjustments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P181_S4	The Rights were terminated on February 6, 2009 in connection with the merger transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P182_S1	At December 31, 2010, approximately $416.7 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 46.5% at December 31, 2010 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 3.9 to one.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	Puget Energy is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P186_S2	In addition, in order to declare or pay unrestricted dividends, Puget Energy s interest coverage ratio may not be less than 1.5 to one and its cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio may not be less than 8.25% for the 12 months ending each quarter-end.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P186_S3	Puget Energy is also subject to other restrictions such as a lock up provision that, in certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain cash flow tests, may further restrict Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	The following table indicates the Company s percentage ownership and the extent of the Company s investment in jointly owned generating plants in service at December 31, 2010.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	The fair value of long-term notes and variable rate notes were estimated using U.S. Treasury yields and related current market credit spreads, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	The carrying values of short-term debt and notes receivable are considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P212_S1	The carrying amount of cash, which includes temporary investments with original maturities of three months or less, is also considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, PSE had $247.0 million and $105.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P213_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2010 and 2009 was 5.11% and 3.59%, respectively.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	PSE s credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	The credit agreements also contain financial covenants which include a cash flow interest coverage ratio and, in addition, if PSE has a below investment grade credit rating, a cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio (each as specified in the facilities).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	PSE certifies its compliance with these covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P215_S3	As of December 31, 2010, PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenants.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	The agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and include variable fee levels.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S2	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank s prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread that is based upon PSE s credit rating.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S3	The $400.0 million working capital facility and $350.0 million credit agreement to support energy hedging allow for issuing standby letters of credit.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S4	PSE must also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S5	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE s credit ratings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S6	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 0.85% and the commitment fee is 0.26%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P216_S7	The $400.0 million working capital facility also serves as a backstop for PSE s commercial paper program.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	In May 2010, PSE s credit facilities were amended, in part, to include a swing line feature allowing same day availability on such borrowings up to $50.0 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	This feature does not increase the total lending commitments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	As of December 31, 2010, $247.0 million was drawn and outstanding under PSE s $400.0 million capital expenditure facility in addition to a $12.6 million letter of credit supporting the BPA contracts.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S3	At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balance of the Note was $22.6 million and $22.9 million, respectively, and the interest rate was 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P219_S5	The $30.0 million credit facility with Puget Energy was not affected by the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	Effective with the close of the merger on February 6, 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five-year term-loan and a $1.0 billion credit facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S1	On December 6, 2010, Puget Energy issued $450.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S2	The net proceeds of $443.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the $1.225 billion five-year term-loan.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S3	Concurrent with the repayment on the term-loan, Puget Energy expensed $7.2 million of the loan s unamortized discount and issuance costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S4	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had fully drawn the five-year term-loan which had a remaining outstanding balance of $782.0 million, and had drawn $258.0 million under the $1.0 billion facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S5	The term-loan and facility mature in February 2014.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S6	These credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants which are similar to PSE s credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S7	Puget Energy s credit agreements contain financial covenants based on the following three ratios: cash flow interest coverage, cash flow to net debt outstanding and debt service coverage (cash available for debt service to borrower interest), each as specified in the facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S8	Puget Energy certifies its compliance with these covenants each quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P220_S9	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	In May 2010, Puget Energy s credit facilities were amended, in part, to include a provision for the sharing of collateral with future note holders when notes are issued to repay and reduce the size of the credit facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	These facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed lenders.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S1	The agreements provide Puget Energy with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and include variable fee levels.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S2	Borrowings may be at the banks prime rate or at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a spread based upon Puget Energy s credit rating.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S3	Puget Energy must also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the $1.0 billion facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S4	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on Puget Energy s credit ratings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P222_S5	As of the date of this report, the spread over prime rate is 1.25%, the spread to the LIBOR is 2.25% and the commitment fee is 0.84%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S1	In January 2009, PSE entered into an agreement to purchase the Fredonia combustion turbines for $42.4 million and its fleet vehicles for $11.8 million, which purchase was completed in January 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S2	These were previously leased under an operating lease.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S3	Entering into the purchase agreement resulted in the reclassification of the Fredonia and fleet leases as capital leases.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S4	Certain leases contain purchase options and renewal and escalation provisions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P223_S5	Rent expense net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	Payments received for the subleases of properties was approximately $0.1 million for each of the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts are:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	PSE leased a portion of its owned natural gas transmission pipeline infrastructure under a non-cancelable operating lease to a third party which expired in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	The capital lease schedule above represents Puget Energy s estimate for leased Tenaska Power Fund, L.P. (Tenaska) turbines in the amount of $42.6 million for the year ended 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P227_S1	As a result of the merger, the Tenaska turbine lease was reclassified from a power purchase agreement to a capital lease for Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	PSE employs various portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P228_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P228_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing PSE s energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible and reducing volatility in costs and margins in the portfolio.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into physical and financial transactions which are appropriate for the service territory of PSE and are relevant to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	On the date of the merger, Puget Energy de-designated its derivative contracts that were designated on PSE s books as NPNS or cash flow hedges and recorded such contracts at fair value as either assets or liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	Certain contracts meeting the criteria defined in ASC 815 were subsequently re-designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P231_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P231_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P231_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P231_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P232_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, commercial paper, and credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P232_S2	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P232_S3	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P233_S0	In February 2009, Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap transactions to hedge the risk associated with its one-month LIBOR floating debt rate.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P233_S1	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had seven interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P234_S0	Effective December 6, 2010, Puget Energy elected to de-designate its interest rate derivatives previously recorded as cash flow hedges based on its intent to refinance the underlying debt over the next few years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P234_S1	The outstanding interest rate derivative loss on December 6, 2010 of $61.8 million was recorded in OCI and will be amortized as the future interest payments on the debt occur.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P234_S2	In addition, a portion of the related forecasted transactions was determined to be remote of occurring and as a result, management reclassified a $7.3 million loss to other deductions in December 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P235_S0	Going forward, all gains or losses associated with the interest rate swaps will be marked-to-market and recorded in earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P235_S1	Puget Energy recorded a $10.9 million gain related to the swaps to interest expense during 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P235_S2	As of December 31, 2010, Puget Energy had not unwound or terminated any of the swaps corresponding to the de-designated cash flow hedge.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P235_S3	A portion of those swaps may remain un-hedged (not linked to any debt) until December 6, 2011 or the Company may unwind or follow other strategies to mitigate the risk of these open positions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P235_S4	During the period for which these swaps remain un-hedged, the Company will be subject to additional interest rate risk.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P236_S0	The following tables present the fair value and locations of Puget Energy s derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P237_S0	Balance sheet location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P238_S0	Puget Energy had a derivative liability and an offsetting regulatory asset of $149.7 million at December 31, 2010 and $67.1 million at December 31, 2009 related to financial contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P238_S1	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P238_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism and the gains and losses on the hedges in future periods will be recorded as gas costs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P239_S0	The following table presents the fair value and locations of PSE s derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2010 and 2009:

1085392_11_ITEM8_P249_S0	On July 1, 2009 all electric and gas related cash flow hedge relationships were de-designated.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P249_S1	Subsequent measurements of fair value are recorded through earnings, not OCI.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P250_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P251_S0	A reclassification of a loss in OCI increases accumulated OCI and decreases earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P251_S1	Amounts reported are in pre-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P252_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P253_S0	The balances associated with the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Predecessor basis were eliminated as a result of push-down accounting effective February 6, 2009, when the Successor period began.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P254_S0	Amounts are reported in pre-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P255_S0	The following table presents the effect of hedging instruments on PSE s OCI and statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P256_S0	On July 1, 2009 all electric and gas related cash flow hedge relationships were de-designated.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P256_S1	Subsequent measurements of fair value are recorded through earnings, not OCI.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P257_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P258_S0	A reclassification of a loss in OCI increases accumulated OCI and decreases earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P258_S1	Amounts reported are in pre-tax dollars.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S0	For derivative instruments that meet cash flow hedge criteria, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S1	Gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S2	Puget Energy expects that $28.6 million of losses in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S3	PSE expects that $33.4 million of losses in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S4	The maximum length of time over which Puget Energy and PSE are hedging their exposure to the variability in future cash flows extends to February 2015 for purchased electricity contracts and to October 2015 for gas for power generation contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P259_S5	For Puget Energy interest rate swaps, the maximum length of forecasted transactions deferred in OCI extends to February 2014.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P260_S0	The following table presents the effect of Puget Energy s derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on income during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P261_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $40.6 million of amortization expense related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the merger and subsequently designated as NPNS.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P262_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $41.7 million of amortization expense related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the merger and subsequently designated as NPNS and $(2.6) million related to hedge ineffectiveness.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P263_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $(1.0) million related to hedge ineffectiveness.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P264_S0	The following table presents the effect of PSE s derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on income during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P265_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $(2.7) million related to hedge ineffectiveness.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P266_S0	The Company had the following outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P267_S0	Unrealized gains (losses) on gas derivatives are offset by a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P268_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P269_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P269_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring, and exposure mitigation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P270_S0	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial problems.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P270_S1	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P270_S2	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P271_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P271_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P271_S2	However, as of December 31, 2010, approximately 99.9% of the Company s energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 0.1% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P271_S3	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P272_S0	The Company generally enters into the following master agreements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements standardized power sales contract in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P272_S1	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offset of monthly payments and, in the event of counterparty default, termination payments.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P273_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA, or NAESB).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P273_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P273_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P273_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P274_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P274_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and coming up with an average value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P274_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P275_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P275_S1	Moreover, the Company applies its own default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net liability position.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P276_S0	Credit reserves are booked as contra accounts to unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P276_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P277_S0	The majority of the Company s derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P277_S1	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post any additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P277_S2	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P278_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company did not have any outstanding energy supply contracts with counterparties that contained credit risk related contingent features, which could result in a counterparty requesting immediate payment or demanding immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P279_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company s derivative activity at December 31, 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P280_S0	Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions at December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P280_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable liability.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P281_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating s agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P282_S0	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P283_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P283_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P283_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P284_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P285_S0	Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P286_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P286_S1	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P287_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P288_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P288_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P288_S2	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P289_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P290_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P290_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P291_S0	Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P291_S1	At each balance sheet date, the Company performs an analysis of all instruments subject to ASC 820 and includes in Level 3 all of those instruments whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P292_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P292_S1	If a fair value measurement relies on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the entire measurement must be placed based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P292_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P293_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas market from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P293_S1	Those forward price quotes are then used in addition to other various inputs to determine the reported fair value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P293_S2	Some of the inputs include the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), assumptions for time value and also the impact of the Company s nonperformance risk on its liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P294_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Company considered the markets for its electric and natural gas Level 2 derivative instruments to be actively traded.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P294_S1	Management s assessment is based on the trading activity volume in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P294_S2	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P295_S0	The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P296_S0	The beginning balance for the Successor period was adjusted to reflect the impact of certain fair value adjustments from the merger transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P297_S0	Transferred in/out of Level 3 for the Successor includes the cash equivalents of $1.4 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P297_S1	The cash equivalents became Level 2 during the second quarter 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P298_S0	The energy derivatives transferred in/out of Level 3 in 2009 includes the cash equivalents of $1.4 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P298_S1	These cash equivalents became Level 2 during the second quarter 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P299_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company s consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P300_S0	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in the net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments section in the Company s consolidated statements of income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P301_S0	The Company does not believe that the fair value diverges materially from the amounts the Company currently anticipates realizing on settlement or maturity.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P302_S0	Certain energy derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because Level 3 inputs are significant to their fair value measurement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P302_S1	Energy derivatives transferred out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were classified as Level 3 at the start of the reporting period for which the lowest significant input became observable during the current reporting period and were transferred into Level 2.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P302_S2	Conversely, energy derivatives transferred into Level 3 from Level 2 represent scenarios in which the lowest significant input became unobservable during the current reporting period.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P302_S3	The Company had no transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the year ended December 31, 2010 or 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P303_S0	The Company has a qualified Employee Investment Plan under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P303_S1	PSE s contributions to the Employee Investment Plan were $11.8 million, $11.4 million and $10.0 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P304_S0	The Employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all PSE employees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary and years of service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S2	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S3	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S4	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P305_S5	The insurance premiums are based on the benefits provided during the year, and are paid primarily by retirees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P306_S0	The February 6, 2009 merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings triggered a new basis of accounting for PSE s retirement benefit plans in the Puget Energy consolidated financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P306_S1	Such purchase accounting adjustments associated with the remeasurement of retirement plans are recorded at Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P307_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, net periodic benefit cost and other changes in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P308_S0	The estimated net loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 are zero and $(2.0) million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P308_S1	The estimated net loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 are $0.4 million and zero, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P308_S2	The estimated net loss (gain), prior service cost (credit) and transition obligation (asset) for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 are immaterial.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P309_S0	The following tables summarize PSE s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, net periodic benefit cost and other changes in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P310_S0	The estimated net loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 are $10.8 million and $(1.6) million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P310_S1	The estimated net loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 are $1.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P310_S2	The estimated net loss (gain), prior service cost (credit) and transition obligation (asset) for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2011 total $(0.3) million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P311_S0	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2011 are expected to be at least $5.0 million, $3.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P312_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, PSE recorded a one-time tax expense of $0.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010, related to a Medicare D subsidy that PSE receives.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P312_S1	These subsidies have been non-taxable in the past and will be subject to federal income taxes after 2012 as a result of the legislation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S0	As part of PSE s new contract with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 77 union, which took effect September 1, 2010, the benefit calculation formula has changed for Company employees covered by the contract.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S1	IBEW represented employees hired after August 31, 2010 and employees not vested in a plan benefit as of July 31, 2010 participate in the cash balance formula of the retirement program, with any accrued benefit converted to a beginning cash balance account.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S2	Employees who were vested in a plan benefit as of July 31, 2010 had a choice to convert to the cash balance formula or remain on a final average earnings formula based on qualified pay and years of service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S3	All employees accruing benefits under the cash balance formula receive the same investment plan match and Company contribution.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S4	Effective December 1, 2010, the IBEW represented employees who accrue benefits under the cash balance formula receive a higher matching contribution and an additional Company contribution as compared to IBEW represented employees who are covered by the final average earnings formula.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S5	These are the same formulas applied to non-union represented employees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S6	IBEW represented employees who were rehired after August 31, 2010, will accrue future benefits under the cash balance formula and will be able to elect to convert their prior benefits to the cash balance formula.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P313_S7	As a result of these changes to the IBEW contract, approximately 88.0% of the employees are in the cash balance formula and approximately 12.0% of the employees are in the final average earnings formula.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P314_S0	In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P315_S0	The Company calculates the present value of the pension liability using a discount rate of 5.15% which represents the single-rate equivalent of the AA rated corporate bond yield curve.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P316_S0	6.50% is the benefit cost discount rate used by Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P316_S1	6.20% is the benefit cost discount rate use by PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P316_S2	The discount rates for the net periodic costs for Puget Energy and PSE were different because of the discount rates in effect as of February 5, 2009, and December 31, 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P317_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 8.0% in 2011 grading down to 4.90% in 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P317_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P318_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P318_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P319_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P319_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains/losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P319_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P319_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P320_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P320_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P321_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P321_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P322_S0	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P322_S1	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P323_S0	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2011 are expected to be at least $5.0 million, $3.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P324_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the qualified pension plans for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P325_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the SERP for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P326_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the other benefits for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P327_S0	Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P327_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P328_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P328_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P329_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P329_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P330_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P331_S0	Effective December 31, 2009, ASC 715 directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P331_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P332_S0	In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P332_S1	The standard allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P332_S2	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P333_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan assets at fair value that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P334_S0	Non US Equity investments are comprised of a (1) mutual fund; and (2) commingled fund.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P334_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P334_S2	The investment in the commingled fund is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P335_S0	Domestic large cap equity investments are comprised of (1) common stock, and (2) commingled fund.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P338_S0	Fixed income securities consist of a mutual fund, convertible securities, corporate bonds, and mortgage backed mortgage pools guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P338_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P338_S2	The other investments are valued using various valuation techniques and sources such as value generation models, broker quotes, benchmark yields and/or other applicable data.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P339_S0	Absolute return investments consist of a mutual fund and two partnerships.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P339_S1	The mutual fund is valued using the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P339_S2	The partnership is valued using the financial reports as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P339_S3	These investments are a Level 3 under ASC 820 because the plan does not have the ability to redeem the investment in the near-term at the net asset value per share.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P340_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P340_S1	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or which have a maturity date not exceeding thirteen months from the date or purchase.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P341_S0	Level 3 assets for the years ended December, 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P342_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P343_S0	This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P343_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P343_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P344_S0	This consists of a deposit fund and a money market fund.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P344_S1	The fair value of the deposit fund is calculated by using the financial reports available as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P345_S0	The money market fund investments are valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2010.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P347_S1	Any shares awarded were either purchased on the open market or were a new issuance.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P347_S2	With the completion of the merger, all shares outstanding under the LTI Plan were fully vested and settled in cash to plan participants.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P347_S3	Puget Energy paid and recognized $14.5 million of merger expense in connection to the vesting of the LTI Plan shares.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P348_S0	The Company generally awarded performance share grants annually under the LTI Plan to key employees which vested at the end of three years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P348_S1	The number of shares awarded and the amount of expense recorded depended on Puget Energy s performance as compared to other companies and service quality indices for customer service.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P348_S2	Compensation expense related to performance share grants was $9.6 million and $3.7 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P348_S3	The weighted-average fair value per performance share granted for the year ended 2008 was $26.72.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P349_S0	Performance shares activity from December 31, 2008 to February 5, 2009 was as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S0	Plan participants meeting the Company s stock ownership guidelines could elect to be paid up to 50.0% of the share award in cash.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S1	The portion of the performance share grants that could be paid in cash was classified and accounted for as a liability.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S2	As a result, the compensation expense of these liability awards was recognized over the performance period based on the fair value (i.e., cash value) of the award, and was periodically updated based on expected ultimate cash payout.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S3	Compensation cost recognized during the performance period for the liability portion of the performance grants was based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of measurement and the number of months of service rendered during the period.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S4	The equity portion was valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P350_S5	In connection with the completion of the merger in 2009, all performance shares vested and the Company paid and recognized $9.6 million recorded in merger and related costs for such shares.

1085392_11_ITEM8_P355_S1	Compensation expense related to the retirement equivalent stock agreement was $0.3 million in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P356_S0	All equivalent stock units vested prior to the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S0	Prior to February 6, 2009, the Company had a non-employee director stock plan for all non-employee directors of Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S1	An amended and restated plan was approved by shareholders in 2005.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S2	Under the plan, non-employee directors received a portion of their quarterly retainer fees in Puget Energy stock except that 100.0% of quarterly retainers were paid in Puget Energy stock until the director held a number of shares equal in value to two years of their retainer fees.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S3	Directors could choose to continue to receive their entire retainer in Puget Energy stock.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S4	The compensation expense related to the director stock plan was $0.4 million and $0.7 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S5	As of December 31, 2008, the number of shares that had been purchased for the director stock plan was 62,362 and the number of shares deferred was 121,253, for a total of 183,615 shares.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P357_S6	The director stock plan was terminated on February 6, 2009 by action of the Board of Directors upon completion of the merger and outstanding shares thereunder were settled.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P358_S0	The details of income tax (benefit) expense are as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P359_S0	The following reconciliation compares pre-tax book income at the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the actual income tax expense in the Statements of Income:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P360_S0	The Company s deferred tax liability at December 31, 2010 and 2009 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P361_S0	The above amounts have been classified in the Balance Sheets as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in the future years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S3	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S4	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2027 through 2030.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P362_S5	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2030.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P363_S0	For ratemaking purposes, deferred taxes are not provided for certain temporary differences.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P363_S1	PSE has established a regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through future rates related to those temporary differences for which no deferred taxes have been provided, based on prior and expected future ratemaking treatment.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P364_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P364_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P365_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P365_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P366_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P366_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P367_S0	For ASC 740 purposes, the Company has open tax years from 2006 through 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P367_S1	The Company is under audit by the IRS for tax years 2006 and 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P367_S2	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P368_S0	The following discussion summarizes the status as of the date of this report of ongoing proceedings relating to the western power markets to which PSE is a party.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P368_S1	PSE is vigorously defending the remaining claims.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P368_S2	Litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and PSE is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P368_S3	Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that these proceedings will not materially and adversely affect PSE s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P369_S0	In October 2000, PSE filed a complaint with the FERC (Docket No.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P369_S1	EL01-10) against all jurisdictional sellers in the Pacific Northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result the FERC ordered for the California markets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P369_S2	The FERC issued an order including price caps in July 2001, and PSE moved to dismiss the proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P370_S0	In response to PSE s motion, various entities intervened and sought to convert PSE s complaint into one seeking retroactive refunds in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P370_S1	The FERC rejected that effort, after holding what the FERC referred to as a preliminary evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P370_S2	In April 2009, the Ninth Circuit rejected the requests for rehearing filed in this matter and remanded the proceeding to the FERC.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P370_S3	The FERC is now considering what response to take to the Court remand order, as petitions for review by the Supreme Court were denied on January 11, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P370_S4	PSE intends to vigorously defend its position but is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P371_S0	In May 2003, approximately 50 plaintiffs initiated an action against the owners of Colstrip regarding pond seepage, The defendants reached an agreement on a global settlement with all plaintiffs and PSE expensed its share of the settlement in 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P371_S1	PSE received a partial reimbursement for its share from insurers in December 2010 and January 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P372_S0	On March 29, 2007, a second complaint related to pond seepage was filed on behalf of two ranch owners alleging damage due to the Colstrip Units 3 4 effluent holding pond.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P372_S1	A mediation between plaintiffs and PPL Montana, LLC, the operator of Units 3 4, took place in July 2010 and parties are working toward a final settlement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P373_S0	Petitioners in several actions in the Ninth Circuit against the BPA asserted that the BPA acted contrary to law in entering into or performing or implementing a number of agreements, including the amended settlement agreement (and the May 2004 agreement) between the BPA and PSE regarding the REP.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P373_S1	Petitioners in several actions in the Ninth Circuit against the BPA also asserted that the BPA acted contrary to law in adopting or implementing the rates upon which the benefits received or to be received from the BPA during the October 1, 2001 through September 30, 2006 period were based.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P374_S0	A number of parties claimed that the rates the BPA proposed or adopted in the BPA rate proceeding to develop the BPA rates to be used in the agreements for determining the amounts of money to be paid to PSE by the BPA during the period October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2009 are contrary to law.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P374_S1	Furthermore, the parties claimed the BPA acted contrary to law or without authority in deciding to enter into, or in entering into or performing or implementing such agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P375_S0	On May 3, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion in Portland Gen. Elec. v. BPA , Case No. 01-70003, in which proceeding the actions of the BPA in entering into settlement agreements regarding the REP with PSE and with other investor-owned utilities were challenged.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P375_S1	In this opinion, the Ninth Circuit granted petitions for review and held the settlement agreements entered into between the BPA and the investor-owned utilities being challenged in that proceeding to be inconsistent with statute.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P375_S2	On May 3, 2007, the Ninth Circuit also issued an opinion in Golden Northwest Aluminum v. BPA , Case No. 03-73426, in which proceeding the petitioners sought review of BPA s 2002-2006 power rates.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P375_S3	In this opinion, the Ninth Circuit granted petitions for review and held that the BPA unlawfully shifted onto its preference customers the costs of its settlements with the investor-owned utilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P375_S4	On October 11, 2007, the Ninth Circuit remanded the May 2004 agreement to the BPA in light of the Portland Gen. Elec. v. BPA opinion and dismissed the remaining three pending cases regarding settlement agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P376_S0	In March 2008, the BPA and PSE signed an agreement pursuant to which BPA made a payment to PSE related to the REP benefits for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, which payment is subject to true-up depending upon the amount of any REP benefits ultimately determined to be payable to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S0	In September 2008, the BPA issued its record of decision in its reopened WP-07 rate proceeding to respond to the various Ninth Circuit opinions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S1	In this record of decision, the BPA adjusted its fiscal year 2009 rates, determined the amounts of REP benefits it considered to have been improperly paid after fiscal year 2001 to PSE and the other regional investor-owned utilities, and determined that such amounts are to be recovered through reductions in REP benefit payments to be made over a number of years.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S2	The amount determined by the BPA to be recovered through reductions commencing October 2007 in REP payments for PSE s residential and small farm customers was approximately $207.2 million plus interest on unrecovered amounts to the extent that PSE receives any REP benefits for its customers in the future.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S3	However, these BPA determinations are subject to subsequent administrative and judicial review, which may alter or reverse such determinations.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S4	PSE and others, including a number of preference agency and investor-owned utility customers of the BPA, in December 2008 filed petitions for review in the Ninth Circuit of various of these BPA determinations.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P377_S5	Any change to the REP would be passed to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P378_S0	In September 2008, the BPA and PSE signed a short-term Residential Purchase and Sale Agreement (RPSA) under which the BPA is to pay REP benefits to PSE for fiscal years ending September 30, 2009 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P378_S1	In December 2008, the BPA and PSE signed another, long-term RPSA under which the BPA is to pay REP benefits to PSE for the period October 2011 through September 2028.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P378_S2	PSE and other customers of BPA in December 2008 filed petitions for review in the Ninth Circuit of the short-term and long-term RPSAs signed by PSE (and similar RPSAs signed by other investor-owned utility customers of the BPA) and the BPA s record of decision regarding such RPSAs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P379_S0	Generally, REP benefit payments under a RPSA are based on the amount, if any, by which a utility's average system cost exceeds the BPA s Priority Firm (PF) Exchange rate for such utility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P380_S0	The average system cost for a utility is determined using an average system cost methodology adopted by the BPA.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P380_S1	The average system cost methodology adopted by the BPA and the average system cost determinations, REP overpayment determinations, and the PF Exchange rate determinations by the BPA are all subject to FERC review or judicial review or both and are subject to adjustment, which may affect the amount of REP benefits paid or to be paid by the BPA to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P380_S2	As discussed above, the BPA has determined to reduce such payments based on its determination of REP benefit overpayments after fiscal year 2001.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P381_S0	It is not clear what impact, if any, such development or review of such the BPA rates, average system cost, average system cost methodology, and the BPA determination of REP overpayments, review of such agreements, and the above described Ninth Circuit litigation may ultimately have on PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P382_S0	On July 7, 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington by the Snoqualmie Valley Preservation Alliance, a group of downstream landowners, against the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) challenging permits issued by the Corps in connection with the redevelopment of the Snoqualmie Falls Hydroelectric Project.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P382_S1	Plaintiffs request an order to stop work at the project pending further review of downstream impacts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P382_S2	PSE sought and was granted permission to intervene in the proceeding.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P383_S0	Motions for summary judgment have been filed by the plaintiff and the Corps.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P383_S1	PSE joined the Corps motion and filed a motion for summary judgment arguing the plaintiff s claims are barred as untimely and improper.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P383_S2	The parties await a determination by the Court.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P383_S3	The ultimate impact of the suit, if any, on PSE or the work currently underway on the project cannot be determined at this time.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P383_S4	The construction schedule has not been impacted by the lawsuit.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P384_S0	In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (ASC 810), a business entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE should consolidate the VIE in its financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P385_S0	A primary beneficiary of a VIE is the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct matters that significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P385_S1	The Company enters into a variety of contracts for energy with other counterparties and evaluates all contracts to determine if they are variable interests.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P385_S2	The Company s variable interests primarily arise through power purchase agreements where it is required to buy all or a majority of generation from a plant at rates set forth in the agreement.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P386_S0	The Company evaluated its power purchase agreements and determined it was not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P386_S1	The Company had previously disclosed two potentially significant variable interests in prior periods; both entities are qualifying facilities contracts that expire at the end of 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P386_S2	The Company requested information from the relevant entities; however, they have refused to provide the necessary information to the Company, as they are not required to do so under their contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P386_S3	However, if the variable interests were determined to be VIEs, the Company has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities based on available information and it has no exposure to losses on these contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P386_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company s purchased power expense for these entities was $190.3 million, $181.2 million and $196.8 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P387_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately 19.2% of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately $0.018 per kilowatt hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P387_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to the contractual shares that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P387_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P387_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P387_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P388_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated payment obligations for power purchases from the Columbia River projects, contracts with other utilities and contracts under non-utility generators under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P388_S1	These contracts have varying terms and may include escalation and termination provisions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P389_S0	Total purchased power contracts provided the Company with approximately 8.2 million, 8.3 million and 8.7 million megawatt hours (MWh) of firm energy at a cost of approximately $420.6 million, $363.3 million and $384.0 million for the years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P390_S0	As part of its electric operations and in connection with the 1997 restructuring of the Tenaska Power Purchase Agreement, PSE is obligated to deliver to Tenaska up to 50,000 MMBtu (one million British thermal units, equal to one Dekatherm (Dth)) per day of natural gas for operation of Tenaska s natural gas-fired cogeneration facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P390_S1	This obligation continues for the remaining term of the agreement, through December 31, 2011, provided that no deliveries are required during the month of May.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P391_S0	The price paid by Tenaska for this natural gas is reflective of the daily price of natural gas at the United States/Canada border near Sumas, Washington.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P392_S0	The Company has natural gas-fired generation facility obligations for natural gas supply amounting to an estimated $65.5 million in 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P392_S1	Longer term agreements for natural gas supply amount to an estimated $137.2 million for 2012 through 2029.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P393_S0	PSE enters into short-term energy supply contracts to meet its core customer needs.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P393_S1	These contracts are generally classified as NPNS or in some cases recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 815.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P393_S2	Commitments under these contracts are $86.0 million, $51.4 million and $9.3 million in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P394_S0	The Company has also entered into various firm supply, transportation and storage service contracts in order to ensure adequate availability of natural gas supply for its firm customers.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P394_S1	Many of these contracts, which have remaining terms from less than one year to 34 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual usage.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P394_S2	The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery obligation to ensure service to PSE s customers and generation requirements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P395_S0	The Company incurred demand charges in 2010 for firm natural gas supply, firm transportation service and firm storage and peaking service of $0.4 million, $136.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P395_S1	The Company incurred demand charges in 2010 for firm transportation and firm storage service for the natural gas supply for its combustion turbines in the amount of $27.7 million, which is included in the total Company demand charges.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P396_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s obligations for future demand charges through the primary terms of its existing contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P396_S1	The quantified obligations are based on current contract prices and the FERC authorized rates, which are subject to change.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P397_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated obligations for service contracts through the terms of its existing contracts.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P398_S0	Energy production service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts on Mint Farm, Wild Horse, Goldendale electric generating facility (Goldendale), Hopkins Ridge and Sumas facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P399_S0	The Company has a self-insurance surety bond in the amount of $4.3 million, which expires on July 1, 2011 and is renewed annually, guaranteeing compliance with the Industrial Insurance Act (workers compensation) and nine self-insurer s pension bonds totaling $1.5 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P400_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P400_S1	The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P401_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P401_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P402_S0	During 1992, the Washington Commission issued orders regarding the treatment of costs incurred by the Company for certain sites under its environmental remediation program.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P402_S1	The orders authorize the Company to accumulate and defer prudently incurred cleanup costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P403_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P404_S0	Per the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies , the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and adjusts loss reserves quarterly.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P405_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs ranging from $38.8 million to $55.8 million for gas and from $8.2 million to $27.8 million for electric.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P405_S1	The Company does not consider any amounts within those ranges as being a better estimate and has therefore accrued $38.8 million and $8.2 million for gas and electric, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P405_S2	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P405_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company incurred deferred electric and natural gas environmental costs of $7.6 million and $54.7 million, net of insurance proceeds, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a Demand Promissory Note (Note).
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S1	Through the Note, PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy, subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S2	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S3	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S4	At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of the Note was $22.6 million and $22.9 million, respectively, and the interest rate was 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S5	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P406_S6	The $30.0 million credit facility with Puget Energy was unaffected by the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P407_S0	On December 6, 2010, Puget Energy issued $450.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P407_S1	Net proceeds of $443.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the $1.225 billion term-loan.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P408_S0	Puget Energy s term-loan and facility for funding capital expenditures mature in 2014, contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed banks and other financial institutions.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P408_S1	One of these banks is Macquarie Bank Limited, which has commitments of $48.0 million under the term-loan and $20.6 million under the capital expenditure credit facility.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P408_S2	Concurrent with the borrowings under these credit agreements, Puget Energy entered into several interest rate swap instruments to hedge volatility associated with these two loans.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P408_S3	Two of the swap instruments were entered into with Macquarie Bank Limited with a total notional amount of $444.9 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P408_S4	These swap instruments remained outstanding at December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P409_S0	At the time of merger, Puget Energy recorded the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P409_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating nonperformance risk.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P409_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P410_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P411_S0	ASC 360 requires long-live assets to be tested for impairment on an on-going basis, whenever events or circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below its carrying value.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P411_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in market price.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P412_S0	Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test as of December 31, 2010 for long-term power purchase contracts and SO2 emission allowances that were assets.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P412_S1	The carrying value of Puget Energy s power contracts and SO2 emission allowances as of December 31, 2010 was approximately $864.7 million and $7.9 million, respectively.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P412_S2	The excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the power contracts was $105.8 million which was written-off against regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P412_S3	The excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the SO2 emissions was $7.9 million which was expensed at December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P413_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2010, management discovered errors in Puget Energy s SO2 emission allowances for 2009 and 2010 interim periods.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P413_S1	Management did not perform the required impairment tests until the fourth quarter of 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P413_S2	As a result, an impairment charge of $7.6 million was recognized within non-utility and other expenses as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P414_S0	During the second quarter of 2010, management corrected accounting errors in the Companies financial statements that resulted in an increase to depreciation expense of $2.2 million, a net decrease to electric revenue and purchased electricity of $1.8 million and a decrease to income tax expense of $1.5 million.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P415_S0	The impact of correcting these errors in prior periods would have reduced Puget Energy s net income by $3.5 million and $1.3 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and PSE s net income by $1.1 million in 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P415_S1	Management determined these errors were not material to the prior annual or interim periods or to the current annual or interim periods in which they are being corrected and, therefore, the Company recorded a reduction to Puget Energy s net income of $4.8 million and PSE s net income of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P416_S0	Puget Energy operates one business segment referred to as the regulated utility segment.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P416_S1	The regulated utility segment includes the account receivables securitization program which was terminated during the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P417_S0	Puget Energy s regulated utility operation generates, purchases and sells electricity and purchases, transports and sells natural gas.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P417_S1	The service territory of PSE covers approximately 6,000 square miles in the state of Washington.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P418_S0	Non-utility business segment includes two PSE subsidiaries, and Puget Energy, is described as Other.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P418_S1	The PSE subsidiaries are a real estate investment and development company and a holding company for a small non-utility wholesale generator which was sold in 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P418_S2	Reconciling items between segments are not significant.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P419_S0	Effective February 6, 2009, all merger related fair value adjustments were retained in Puget Energy.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P419_S1	Accordingly, only the financial statements of Puget Energy were adjusted to reflect the purchase accounting.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P419_S2	Prior to the merger, the business segment financial statements for Puget Energy and PSE were the same.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P420_S0	The following unaudited amounts, in the opinion of the Company, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim periods.
1085392_11_ITEM8_P421_S0	Quarterly amounts vary during the year due to the seasonal nature of the utility business.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P1_S0	This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2010, the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles as of 2010 year end were:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P2_S0	Jennifer L. O Connor, Former Senior Vice President General Counsel, Corporate Secretary, and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P3_S0	This section includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P3_S1	It also discusses changes in executive roles made in connection with Mr. Reynolds retirement as CEO of the Company in March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P5_S0	Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P6_S0	Align compensation payment levels with achievement of Company goals.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P7_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee receives information and advice on various aspects of executive compensation from its outside compensation consultant, Towers Watson (formerly Towers Perrin).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Committee recommends the pay level for our CEO, based on recommendations from Towers Watson to the Committee, and recommends the pay levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO, to the full Board for approval.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the establishment of annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of awards under those plans.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P8_S0	In 2010, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P9_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total pay opportunity.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P9_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P9_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive pay to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets base pay and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive pay) to the 50th percentile of this comparator group.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P9_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P9_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company from a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P11_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P12_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P12_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded solely for meeting and exceeding target levels of annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P12_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P12_S3	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for its annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P13_S0	As described below, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay reduce the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S0	Execute the Company s succession planning process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings with his executive team.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S3	The talent reviews include evaluations prepared within the Company and by external organizational development consultants.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S4	The Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P14_S5	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P15_S0	During 2010, the Board worked with Mr. Reynolds on a succession plan to ensure a smooth transition in connection with his retirement as CEO in March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P15_S1	In July 2010, Mr. Reynolds voluntarily resigned as President of the Company and the Board appointed Ms. Harris, then the Company s Executive Vice President and Chief Resource Officer, to that position.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P15_S2	In November 2010, Mr. Reynolds announced that he would retire as CEO, and effective with Mr. Reynolds retirement on March 1, 2011, Ms. Harris became CEO of the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P16_S0	A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for achievement of Company goals.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P16_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives and creates a record of their results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P16_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management and/or the Board.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P16_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not provide an incentive to executives to take unreasonable risks that could have a material adverse effect relating to the Company s business and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P17_S0	The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a small number of perquisites.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P17_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P17_S2	Since the Company is no longer publicly listed following its merger in February 2009, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P18_S0	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group and achieve current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P18_S1	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, though long-term incentive programs are designed to comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P18_S2	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P18_S3	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2010 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the connection to investors.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P19_S0	The Committee annually reviews total compensation opportunity and actual total compensation received over the prior years by each executive officer in the form of a tally sheet.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P19_S1	This review helps inform the Committee s decisions on program designs by allowing the Committee to review overall pay received in relation to Company results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P20_S0	In making compensation decisions on base salary and annual and long-term incentive programs, management prepares comprehensive pay surveys for review by the Committee and the Committee s outside executive pay consultant, Towers Watson.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P20_S1	The Committee also received advice from Towers Watson in making 2010 compensation decisions.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P21_S0	The surveys summarize data provided by the Towers Perrin 2009 Energy Services survey for a selection of utility and other companies that are most similar in scope and size to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P21_S1	For the review of compensation pay levels and practices in 2010, we included the following utility companies in our comparator group that were all of similar scope (generally $1.5 billion $6.0 billion revenue and $4.0 billion $11.0 billion asset size) and also participated in the Towers Perrin 2009 Energy Services survey:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P22_S0	Base pay and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive pay) are targeted to the 50th percentile of the industry comparator group if the Company s performance goals are achieved at target.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P22_S1	If results are below expectations, total direct compensation is lower than this targeted level.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P22_S2	If achievement of performance goals significantly exceeds target, total cash compensation can approach the 75th percentile.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P23_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed to see how they position the executive in relation to the median of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P23_S1	The Company may choose to pay an executive above or below the median level of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P24_S0	We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed portion of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P25_S0	Base salaries are generally targeted at the 50th percentile for the comparator group and are reviewed annually by the Committee on an individual basis using as a guideline, median salary levels of our comparator group, as well as internal pay equity among executives.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P25_S1	Actual salaries vary by individual and depend on additional factors, such as an individual s expertise, level of performance achievement, level of experience and level of contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P26_S0	The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2010 and recommended to the Board that base salaries not be changed from 2009 levels for 2010, in light of the continued difficult economic environment faced by many of our customers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P26_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation, and base salaries for 2010 generally remained at the median of market among the comparator group.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P26_S2	Effective July 1, 2010, the Board appointed Ms. Harris as President of the Company and increased her base salary from $360,000 to $680,000.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P26_S3	In establishing the level of pay for Ms. Harris, the Committee recommended and the Board approved base pay that was below the median of market among the comparator group, reflecting Ms. Harris s new tenure in 2010 as President.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S0	Our annual and long-term incentives help executives focus on the priorities of our investors and customers and reward performance that meets or exceeds goals.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S1	Both the Company s annual incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan measure and reward the Company s performance on Service Quality Indices (SQIs).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S2	These reporting measures were developed in collaboration with the Company s regulator, the Washington Commission, and provide customers with a report card on the Company s customer service and reliability.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S3	In fact, we provide an annual accounting on these measures to the Washington Commission and our customers each year.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S4	Additional key performance measures used in 2010 for determining incentives were EBITDA in the annual incentive plan and Total Return in the long-term incentive plan.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P27_S5	EBITDA and Total Return are important performance measures of economic return to our investors, and their accomplishment indicates to our customers that the Company has the financial strength needed for long-term sustainability.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S0	All PSE employees, including executive officers, participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives to executives for achieving desired annual operating results while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S2	For 2010, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against 9 SQIs covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S3	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S4	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P28_S5	For 2010, the Washington Commission agreed to remove one SQI that had been applicable for 2009 relating to limiting disconnects for non-payment, and during a future Company general rate case, the Washington Commission will determine if that measure should be reinstated for future years.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P29_S0	The report for 2010 and prior years is available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P30_S0	The SQIs for 2010 were as follows:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P31_S0	The annual incentive plan for 2010 had a funding level based on customer service, as measured by SQI achievement, and EBITDA as shown in the table below.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P31_S1	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P32_S0	The annual incentive plan had a funding level based on EBITDA and attainment of SQIs as shown in the table below.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P33_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not do so for 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P34_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on a subjective evaluation of an executive officer s performance against team and individual goals.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P34_S1	Individual goals were developed from the overall corporate goals for 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P35_S0	and providing innovative and improved services, products and programs.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P36_S0	that meets our customers needs, promotes environmental stewardship and provides a fair return to investors.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P37_S0	promote energy efficiency initiatives, encourage corporate giving and instill community involvement.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P38_S0	Value Employees Safety is key; work safely.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P38_S1	Value diversity, teamwork and open communication.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P39_S0	employees through technology, process improvement, recognition, training and development.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P40_S0	any internal or external compliance obligation.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P41_S0	Continue to Learn and Grow Strive to get better at what we do every day.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P42_S0	challenge our assumptions and apply lessons learned to improve our efforts on behalf of customers and the community.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P43_S0	Actual performance of the corporate goals for 2010 was below target but above the threshold level for EBITDA, and at target for SQI achievement.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P43_S1	PSE EBITDA was $907.8 million, and SQI achievement was 9 out of 9, leading to a funding level of 80.9%.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P44_S0	For 2010, the target incentive levels for this plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of base salary as shown in the table below, based on the individual executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P44_S1	The Board increased the target incentive for Ms. Harris from 60% to 85% of her base salary of $680,000 when it appointed her President of the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P44_S2	For 2010, Ms. Harris s target annual incentive was pro-rated to reflect her two roles during the year (six months as Executive Vice President and Chief Resource Officer and six months as President).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P44_S3	With the exception of Ms. Harris, target annual incentive opportunities for the executives remained unchanged from 2009 levels.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P44_S4	The maximum incentive for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P45_S0	An individual executive s formula amount can be increased or decreased based on a subjective assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P45_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were met by each executive, the CEO did not make adjustments for individual performance of the Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2010 and the amounts shown below were approved by the Board and paid in March 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P45_S2	For Mr. Reynolds, the Board reviewed his individual and Company performance during 2010 and his contributions to the Company during his tenure and approved an award 5.2% above the formula amount, or 84.6% of funding level.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P46_S0	In addition to the annual incentive program, the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Reynolds, are eligible to receive merger performance bonuses under the terms of their Executive Employment Agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P46_S1	Ms. O Connor received a merger performance bonus at the first anniversary of the merger in February 2010, but voluntarily resigned in October 2010 and forfeited eligibility for a merger performance bonus at the second anniversary.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P46_S2	Ms. O Connor also forfeited eligibility for a 2010 annual incentive.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P47_S0	Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P48_S0	Prior to the merger completed in February 2009, executives received equity awards under the Puget Energy 2005 LTI Plan in the form of performance shares and performance-based restricted stock.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P48_S1	Awards vested based on the Company achieving a targeted level of performance during a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P48_S2	Upon the merger, all unvested LTI Plan awards accelerated in vesting and became payable in cash in 2009 pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P48_S3	As a result of this acceleration, the 2008-2010 performance cycle was terminated, and no LTI Plan awards were paid during 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P49_S0	Since 2009, the Company has continued the basic design of the pre-merger LTI Plan program, including retention of three-year performance cycles that begin each year.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P49_S1	Since the Company no longer has publicly listed stock, LTI Plan awards for the 2009-2011 and 2010-2012 performance cycles are denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P50_S0	The Committee determines the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating the actual payment and forecast target payment of long-term incentive awards of our market comparator group for comparable levels of responsibility.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P50_S1	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when granting annual incentive awards or making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P51_S0	Each year s grant is primarily viewed in the context of the compensation opportunity needed to maintain the Company s competitive position relative to the comparator group.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P52_S0	Target LTI Plan awards are calculated based on a percentage of annual salary, taking into account the executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P52_S1	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2010-2012 performance cycle were 170% of base salary for Mr. Reynolds; 110% for Mr. Valdman and Mr. Markell; 50% for Mr. Eldredge and Mr. Gaines; and 95% for Ms. O Connor.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P52_S2	In connection with her appointment as President, Ms. Harris s target LTI Plan award increased from 110% to 170% of her base salary of $680,000, and her 2010 grant was pro-rated to reflect her two roles during the year (six months as Executive Vice President and Chief Resource Officer and six months as President).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P52_S3	With the exception of Ms. Harris, target LTI Plan award opportunities as a percentage of base salary remained unchanged from 2009 levels for the Named Executive Officers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P53_S0	Except for the CEO, 50% of each grant of LTI Plan units is allocated to achievement of SQIs only (SQI component) and 50% is allocated to achievement of a combination of SQIs and Total Return (Total Return component).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P53_S1	The CEO s LTI Plan units are allocated 30% to the SQI component and 70% to the Total Return component to place additional weight on financial measures, consistent with other peer companies.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P53_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer is equal to the applicable percentage of salary divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P53_S3	For the 2010-2012 performance cycle, the initial per unit value was $31.56.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P54_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the performance measures of SQIs and Total Return as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P54_S1	Unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings LLC level and is re-calculated each year based on the change in Total Return for the prior year as measured by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P54_S2	Total Return reflects the annual change in the value of the Company plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P55_S0	For any award to be earned in a performance cycle, average SQI results must meet or exceed 80% accomplishment of the available SQIs set forth above under Annual Incentive Compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P56_S0	Executives must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, disability or death.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P57_S0	The tables and points below summarize the performance measures and design of the LTI Plan grants for the current performance cycles.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P58_S0	CEO grants are split 30% SQI component and 70% Total Return Component.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P59_S0	Total Return Component is determined based on a combination of Total Return and 3-year average SQI results.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P60_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return Component that will be earned based on three-year performance.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P60_S1	Percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P61_S0	A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of 80% of SQIs during the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P61_S1	The actual award is paid at target level if an average of at least 80% of SQIs are satisfied during the performance cycle, but is not paid if the average is below 80%.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P61_S2	If threshold SQI performance is met, the amount payable is equal to the product of the target number of units granted and the per unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P62_S0	If 80% SQIs are met during the performance cycle, but the Total Return threshold of 10% is not met, the SQI component will still be paid at target.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P63_S0	A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of Total Return and SQI performance during the three-year performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P63_S1	The actual award paid is based on Company performance relative to target, subject to a minimum threshold level of performance of 10% for Total Return (based on average Total Return over the performance cycle) and average SQI achievement of 80%.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P64_S0	The LTI Plan unit value is determined annually by applying the Total Return for each year to the prior year s unit price.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P65_S0	At the completion of the performance cycle, if the Total Return component is paid, the participant receives a cash payment equal to the number of units earned based on performance during the performance cycle multiplied by the unit price at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P66_S0	If the Total Return component exceeds 10% annualized 3-year return, but the SQI threshold is not met, the Total Return component will not be paid.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P67_S0	The Company s 2010-2012 outstanding LTI Plan grants had the following performance during 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P68_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2012.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P69_S0	Performance on the SQI component of the grant was at 9 out of 9, which if continued for the remaining two years of the performance cycle would mean that the SQI component would pay based on the target number of units granted to a Named Executive Officer.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P70_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2010 was 7.1%, below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P71_S0	The Company s 2009-2011 outstanding LTI Plan grants had the following performance during 2009 and 2010:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P72_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2011.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P73_S0	Performance on the SQI component of the grant was at 9 out of 10 in 2009, or 90%, and 9 out of 9 in 2010, or 100%, for a combined two-year result of 95%, which if continued for the remaining year of the performance cycle would mean that the SQI component would pay based on the target number of units granted to a Named Executive Officer.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S0	The Company maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for executives to provide a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S2	All the Named Executive Officers except Mr. Reynolds participate in the SERP.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S3	When Mr. Reynolds was hired, he elected to receive an annual contribution to his account in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees in lieu of participating in the SERP, as described in the following paragraph.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S4	He participates in the Retirement Plan.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P74_S5	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2010 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P75_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P75_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonus and LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P75_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly based on corporate bond rates.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P76_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P76_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P76_S2	Under the terms of Mr. Reynolds employment agreement, he additionally receives an annual Company contribution to his Deferred Compensation Plan account equal to 15% of the base salary and annual incentive payment he received during the prior year.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P76_S3	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan and Mr. Reynolds employment agreement arrangement, as well as his year-end balance, is shown in the 2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P77_S0	The Company has entered into agreements with its executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, that provide for certain payments and benefits if an executive s employment is terminated or terminates for certain reasons, such as following a change in control.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P77_S1	Benefits provided under these agreements are important for two primary reasons.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P78_S0	First, many executives when joining a new company require a level of assurance that they will receive pay in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control after they join the company.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P78_S1	Second, the Company provides these agreements so that the executives are focused on the Company s ongoing operations and are not distracted by the employment uncertainty that can arise in the event of a change in control.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P78_S2	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control arrangements for the comparator group considering benchmarking information provided by Towers Watson.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P78_S3	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P79_S0	Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Reynolds, which amended and restated existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the executives.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P79_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following the February 6, 2009 completion of the merger and generally provide benefits similar to those under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P79_S2	In addition, the agreements provide for a merger performance bonus equal to 100% of the executives annual base salary, payable on or shortly following each of the first and second anniversaries of the completion of the merger if the Company achieves specified minimum SQI performance goals established by the Committee (for 2010, 80% of SQIs or better) and the executive remains employed at the Company until the anniversary of the merger for which payment is made.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P79_S3	Ms. O Connor received a merger performance bonus at the first anniversary of the merger, but voluntarily resigned in October 2010 and forfeited eligibility for payment at the second anniversary.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P80_S0	Following the merger, Mr. Reynolds employment agreement, as amended, continued, except that effective as of December 31, 2009, Mr. Reynolds agreed to waive any change in control benefits and payments that might otherwise be payable to him under the agreement on or after December 31, 2009, including upon a subsequent change in control.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P80_S1	Mr. Reynolds employment agreement terminated effective February 28, 2011 in connection with his retirement as CEO.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P81_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and perquisites targeted to competitive practices.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S1	The executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S2	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S3	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services, business club memberships and executive physicals up to an annual limit.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S4	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S5	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for individual use of club facilities.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P82_S6	These perquisites do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation, amounting to less than $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P83_S0	A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P83_S1	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value incentive opportunity for annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target level award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P83_S2	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P84_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P85_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P86_S0	The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P86_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P87_S0	The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P87_S1	Except as noted below, each member of the Committee served during all of 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P88_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P88_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P89_S0	The following information is furnished for the year ended December 31, 2010 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2010.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P90_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P91_S0	Reflects the grant date fair value of 2008 LTI Plan grants which were settled in cash in 2009 in connection with the merger.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P91_S1	Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in note 18 to the Company s audited financial statements included in the Company s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P92_S0	For 2010, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2010 Goals and Incentive Plan and the first year of merger performance bonuses payable to each of the executives, except Mr. Reynolds who was not eligible for a merger performance bonus.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P92_S1	Cash incentive amounts are based on 2010 performance and were paid in early 2011 or deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P92_S2	The 2010 Goals and Incentive Plan is described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the amounts actually paid to each Named Executive Officer for 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P92_S3	The threshold, target and maximum amounts that could have been paid under the 2010 Goals and Incentive Plan are set forth in the 2010 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P93_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P93_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P93_S2	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2010 Pension Benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P93_S3	Mr. Reynolds does not participate in the SERP, and his accumulated benefit shown is only from the qualified pension plan.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P99_S1	Club use is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P99_S2	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P100_S0	Includes Company contributions during 2010 to PSE s Investment Plan (a tax qualified 401(k) plan) and the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P100_S1	For Mr. Reynolds, this includes the Company contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan equal to 15% of Mr. Reynolds base salary and annual incentive for the prior year, $242,086, which is described in more detail in the 2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P102_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2010 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P103_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2010 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2010 of $849.5 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/9.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P103_S1	Payment would be $0 if either trigger is not met.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P103_S2	The threshold estimate assumes $849.5 million EBITDA and SQI performance at 6/9.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P103_S3	The target estimate assumes $943.9 million EBITDA and SQI performance at 9/9.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P103_S4	The maximum estimate assumes $1,274.3 million EBITDA or higher and SQI performance at 9/9.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P104_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants are allocated between an SQI component and a Total Return component.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P104_S1	Payments are calculated based on the average three-year performance of SQIs and Total Return at Puget Holdings LLC and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P104_S2	Threshold estimate assumes that SQI results average 80% achievement, Total Return is below 10%, and ending unit value is $31.56.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P104_S3	Target estimate assumes that SQI results average 90%, Total Return averages 12%, and ending unit value is $44.34.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P104_S4	Maximum estimate assumes that SQI results average 100%, Total Return averages 15%, and ending unit value is $48.00.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P105_S0	Ms. O Connor forfeited eligibility to the annual incentive, receiving $0 for 2010 performance, and forfeited eligibility in all outstanding LTI Plan grants, including the LTI Plan 2010-2012 grant, when she voluntarily resigned.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P106_S0	The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P106_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P106_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P106_S3	Except as described below in footnote 1, relating to Mr. Reynolds, each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P107_S0	Mr. Reynolds participates in the Retirement Plan, but does not participate in the SERP.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P108_S0	In lieu of participating in the SERP, each year Mr. Reynolds account under the Deferred Compensation Plan is credited with an amount equal to 15% of his base salary and annual incentive for the preceding year.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P108_S1	The value of this deferred compensation account at December 31, 2010 of $3,991,754 is also shown in the 2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P109_S0	The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P109_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P110_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2010 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P110_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are 4.0% for 2011 and are assumed to average 5.5% annually thereafter.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P110_S2	The discount assumption is 5.15%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2011 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 3.78%, 6.31% and 6.57% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2010).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2009 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2009.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S3	These assumptions included assumed average cash balance interest credits of 4% for 2010 and 5.5% for all future years, a discount assumption of 5.75% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2010 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 5.03%, 6.73% and 6.82% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2009).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P111_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2009 were the same as those used for December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P112_S0	As described in footnote 2 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P112_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P113_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P113_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S0	Under the Retirement Plan, Puget Energy s and PSE s eligible salaried employees, including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S3	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan, signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S4	For 2009 through 2011, the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit was $245,000.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P114_S5	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P115_S0	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P115_S1	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P115_S2	For 2010 and 2011 the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S4	This reduction is subsidized that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P116_S7	As of December 31, 2010, all the Named Executive Officers were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P117_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P117_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P118_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P118_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P118_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P118_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P118_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_11_ITEM11_P119_S0	If a participant in the cash balance portion of the Retirement Plan dies while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, then his or her Retirement Plan benefit will be immediately vested.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P119_S1	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).

1085392_11_ITEM11_P121_S1	All the participating Named Executive Officers are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P121_S2	Ms. O Connor voluntarily resigned in October 2010 and will be entitled to receive her SERP benefit beginning at age 62.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P122_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a vested executive (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below:
1085392_11_ITEM11_P123_S0	One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P123_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three calendar years of earnings.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P123_S2	The three calendar years do not have to be consecutive, but they must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P123_S3	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P124_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P124_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P127_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P127_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P128_S1	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P128_S2	If the executive is eligible for early retirement, the death benefit will be calculated based on the survivor benefit the spouse would have received as of the earliest commencement date.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P128_S3	Distribution will be made to the executive s surviving spouse as soon as administratively practicable after the executive s death.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P128_S4	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P135_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan grants.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P135_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P135_S2	The Annual Investment Plan Restoration Amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.

1085392_11_ITEM11_P141_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P141_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P141_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P141_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P142_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P142_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_11_ITEM11_P142_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).

1085392_11_ITEM13_P0_S0	Our Boards of Directors have adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P0_S1	Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P1_S0	A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction reported to the Chief Compliance Officer will be reviewed according to the following procedures:
1085392_11_ITEM13_P3_S0	If the Chief Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P4_S0	If disclosure is required, the Chief Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P4_S1	The Chair is authorized to approve or ratify any related person transaction involving an aggregate amount of less than $1.0 million or when it would be impracticable to wait for the next Audit Committee meeting to review the transaction.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P5_S0	If the transaction is outside the Chair s authority, the Chair will submit the transaction to the Audit Committee for review and approval or ratification.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P6_S0	When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including:
1085392_11_ITEM13_P7_S0	Whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P8_S0	If any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the Committee may take such action as it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P9_S0	Kimberly Harris, who serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director of Puget Energy and PSE, is married to Kyle Branum, a principal at the law firm Riddell Williams P.S. since 2008.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P10_S0	Riddell Williams or its predecessor firms have been one of PSE s primary law firms for nearly 50 years.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P10_S1	In 2010, Riddell Williams was paid $1.41 million for legal services provided to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P10_S2	Mr. Branum is among the lawyers at Riddell Williams who provide legal services to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P10_S3	This work was performed under the direct supervision of the office of the general counsel and the compensation arrangements were comparable to other regional law firms providing legal services to PSE.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P11_S0	The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P11_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, William Ayer (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE) and Herbert Simon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P11_S2	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P11_S3	The Company s definition of Independent Director is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P12_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P12_S1	The Board has also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P12_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P13_S0	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and there respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P14_S0	Messrs. Ayer and Simon serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P14_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P14_S2	In addition, PSE has entered into transactions with entities for whom Mr. Simon serves as a director or officer, or in which he otherwise has a financial interest, that involve amounts that are less than the greater of $1.0 million or 1% of those entities consolidated gross revenue.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P14_S3	These transactions fall within the second categorical standard described above.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P14_S4	Because these relationships either fall within the Board s categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to Puget Energy or the other entity, the Board has concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P15_S0	Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P15_S1	Mr. Ayer, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.
1085392_11_ITEM13_P16_S0	Interested parties may communicate with the non-management directors of the Board through the procedures described in Item 10 of Part III of this annual report under the section Communications with the Board.

1085392_11_ITEM14_P4_S2	Under the policies, unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by an Audit Committee.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P4_S3	In addition, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by an Audit Committee.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P5_S0	The annual audit services engagement terms and fees, as well as any changes in terms, conditions and fees relating to the engagement, are subject to specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

1085392_11_ITEM14_P5_S2	With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide detailed back-up documentation to the Audit Committee regarding the specific services to be provided.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P5_S3	Under the policies, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of their members.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P5_S4	The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P5_S5	The Audit Committee does not delegate responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management.
1085392_11_ITEM14_P6_S0	For 2010 and 2009, all audit and non-audit services were pre-approved.

1085392_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, Macquarie-FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The following table presents the number of PSE customers as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	During 2011, PSE s billed retail and transportation revenue from electric utility operations were derived 53.5% from residential customers, 40.0% from commercial customers, 5.1% from industrial customers and 1.4% from other customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	PSE s retail revenue from natural gas utility operations were derived 65.9% from residential customers, 29.8% from commercial customers, 3.0% from industrial customers and 1.3% from transportation customers in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P7_S2	During this period, the largest customer accounted for approximately 1.6% of PSE s operating revenue.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	PSE is affected by various seasonal weather patterns and therefore, utility revenue and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Energy usage varies seasonally and monthly, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE experiences its highest retail energy sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P9_S2	Sales of electricity to wholesale customers also vary by quarter and year depending principally upon fundamental market factors and weather conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	PSE has a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	PSE also has a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism in retail electric rates to recover variations in electricity costs on a shared basis with customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	In the five-year period ended December 31, 2011, PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.6 billion and retirements were $383.3 million.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	In the same five-year period, PSE s gross natural gas utility plant additions were $839.0 million and retirements were $125.0 million and PSE s gross common utility plant additions were $342.7 million and retirements were $290.3 million.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2011 was approximately $8.4 billion, which consisted of 43.0% distribution, 31.1% generation, 6.2% transmission and 19.7% general plant and other.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P11_S3	Gross natural gas utility plant at December 31, 2011 was approximately $2.9 billion, which consisted of 93.7% distribution and 6.3% general plant and other.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P11_S4	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2011 was approximately $518.3 million.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	At December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had no employees and PSE had approximately 2,800 full-time employees.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	Approximately 1,240 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire September 30, 2013 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	Puget Energy s and PSE s principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Item 10 Part III of this annual report.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	On January 6, 2012, PSE filed an electric transmission rate case with FERC as well as an increase in ancillary service charges.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	PSE is requesting a rate increase of $3.8 million with an effective date of April 1, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	In the filing, PSE requested a formula transmission rate for network and point-to-point transmission service.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	A formula rate is a fixed methodology for calculating a rate based upon various cost and billing determinant inputs to recover the operating costs of the transmission system.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	The formula rate is updated annually and posted on PSE s Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) with an informational filing to FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P17_S2	This streamlined process allows PSE to recover its costs on a timely basis, provides for a transparent process with transmission customers and seeks to ensure that there is no under or over collection.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	Formula transmission rates are encouraged and broadly accepted by FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in electric rates of $160.7 million or 8.1%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	On September 1, 2011, PSE filed supplemental testimony to adjust the electric rate increase to $152.3 million, a 7.7% increase to rates, due to changes in projected power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S4	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested electric rate increase to $126.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P19_S5	The $26.3 million reduction was primarily due to updates to power costs and to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how Renewable Energy Credit ( REC) proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	The order required REC proceeds to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P21_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P21_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company s RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Company s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE s approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	The petition is still pending approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	Effective July 1, 2010, the Washington Commission approved a change in PSE s PTC tariff as PSE has not been able to utilize PTCs since 2007, due to insufficient taxable income caused primarily by bonus tax depreciation.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The Washington Commission approved PSE suspending its PTC tariff, effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	This resulted in an overall increase in PSE s electric rates of 1.7%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	On September 22, 2010, a joint proposal and accounting petition was filed with the Washington Commission by PSE, Washington Commission Staff and Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities which addressed how to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addresses REC proceeds to be returned to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S1	On October 26, 2010, the Washington Commission issued an order granting the joint proposal and accounting petition.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S2	The order allows the Company to credit customers for REC revenue received and deferred through November 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S3	This credit reduced rates by $27.7 million, or 2.9%, over five months beginning November 2010 through March 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S4	RECs received after November 2009 will be retained by PSE and will be used to recapture the benefit of PTCs previously provided to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S5	Once these PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return, the customers will receive the benefit.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P25_S6	There is no impact to net income related to these items.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	On December 30, 2010, the Washington Commission approved revisions to PSE s PTC tariff, effective January 1, 2011, which changed the methodology by which PTCs are passed-through to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S1	Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of PTCs, the PTCs will pass-through to customers following the year in which they are able to be utilized on PSE s tax return, rather than in the same year in which they are generated by qualifying wind powered facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S2	The rate schedule will pass-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million treasury grant in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S3	The Washington Commission order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the treasury grant on an annual basis and includes 23 months of treasury grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represents the month the treasury grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S4	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P26_S5	Since the tariff now addresses additional federal incentives, it has been renamed the Federal Incentive Tracker.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The following table sets forth electric rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in natural gas rates of $31.9 million or 3.0%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested natural gas rate increase to $28.6 million.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	The $3.3 million reduction was primarily due to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	On March 14, 2011, the Washington Commission issued its order authorizing PSE to increase its natural gas general tariff rates by $19.0 million or 1.8% on an annual basis effective April 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	On April 26, 2011, PSE filed a new tariff for a Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Program.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	This program is intended to enhance pipeline safety by providing for the timely recovery of the Company s cost to replace certain natural gas system infrastructure that would emphasize system reliability, integrity and safety which would increase natural gas revenue by $1.9 million or 0.2%.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Washington Commission held a hearing on November 17, 2011 and an order from the Washington Commission is pending.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	On October 27, 2011, the Washington Commission approved PSE s PGA natural gas tariff filing effective November 1, 2011, to decrease the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved charge is a decrease of $43.5 million, or 4.3% annually.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE s net income.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	Average usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	At December 31, 2011, PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,707 megawatts (MW).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments that may include, but are not limited to, weather-related hedges.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	Net of 59 MW of capacity delivered to Canada pursuant to the provisions of a treaty between Canada and the United States and Canadian Entitlement Allocation agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	Power received from other utilities and firm contracts are classified between hydroelectric and other producers based on the character of the utility system used to supply the power or, if the power is supplied from a particular resource, the character of that resource.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	Short-term wholesale purchases, net of resale, of 1,811,328 megawatt hours (MWh) and 2,498,452 MWh account for 29.3% and 14.1% of energy production, for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	At December 31, 2011, PSE owns or controls the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 2,917 MW:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility, operated pursuant to 50-year license granted by the FERC in October 2008, will require net present value funds between $305.0 million to $325.0 million for capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs over 50 years in order to implement the license conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	The license provides protection and enhancements for fish and wildlife, water quality, recreation and cultural and historic resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility, operated pursuant to 40-year license granted by the FERC in June 2004, will require net present value funds between $240.0 million to $260.0 million for capital expenditures and operations and maintenance costs over 40 years in order to implement the license conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Snoqualmie Falls will have partial output upon completion of powerhouse 2 anticipated for March 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	The plant is expected to be fully operational and provide a net maximum capacity of approximately 54 MW upon completion of powerhouse 1 expected in the second quarter of 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	At December 31, 2011, Electron project output is limited to approximately 7 MW due to the condition of the flume that conveys water to the plant.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P50_S1	This limitation is expected through at least late 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	During 2011, approximately 24.2% of PSE s energy requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P51_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	As of December 31, 2011, PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	On February 3, 2006, PSE and Chelan entered into a new Power Sales Agreement and a related Transmission Agreement for 25.0% of the output of Chelan s Rocky Reach and Rock Island hydroelectric generating facilities, located on the mid-Columbia River, in exchange for PSE paying 25.0% of the operating costs of the facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	The agreements terminate in 2031 and provide that PSE will begin to receive power upon expiration of PSE s existing long-term contracts with Chelan for the Rocky Reach and Rock Island output (expiring in 2011 and 2012, respectively).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P53_S2	PSE made a non-refundable capacity reservation payment of $89.0 million as required by the agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P53_S3	The Washington Commission determined the prudence of PSE entering into the new Chelan contracts and confirmed the treatment of the $89.0 million as a regulatory asset as part of its order in PSE s general rate case on January 5, 2007.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	Douglas County PUD began the FERC integrated licensing process in 2004 and is progressing on schedule for a new license upon the current license expiration in May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	PSE s share of power under the 2001 contract will decline over time as Grant County PUD s load increases.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	PSE s share of both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum developments was 0.8% at the end of 2011 and will not be less than 0.6% through 2052.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P56_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the BPA (for 42 average megawatts (aMW) of capacity) and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	Pursuant to the provisions of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) and Washington state regulations, PSE also enters into long-term firm purchased power contracts with non-utility generators.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	PSE purchases the net electrical output of these projects at fixed and annually escalating prices, intended to approximate PSE s avoided cost of new generation projected at the time these agreements were made.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	During 2011, PSE had agreements with March Point Cogeneration Company for 140 MW capacity of power output and 123 aMW of energy; and Tenaska Washington Partners, L.P. for 245 MW capacity of power output and 216 aMW of energy.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Both contracts expired December 31, 2011 and there is no obligation to extend the contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Further, PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P61_S1	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P61_S2	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P61_S3	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	In 2011, PSE had 4,020 MW and 619 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P62_S1	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P63_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P63_S3	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P64_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P64_S1	During 2011, approximately 83.0% of natural gas for power purchased by PSE for power customers originated in British Columbia and 17.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P65_S0	Natural gas is either marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) or injected into the power portfolio s natural gas storage when the natural gas is not needed for the combustion turbines.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P66_S0	PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file electric and natural gas Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) every two years with the next IRP scheduled to be filed by May 30, 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P66_S1	PSE filed its most recent IRP with the Washington Commission on May 30, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P67_S0	The 2011 IRP demonstrated PSE s continuing need to acquire significant amounts of new generating resources, driven primarily by the expiration of existing power purchase contracts and by the requirements of the state s renewable portfolio standard.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P67_S1	The 2011 IRP, as filed, identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P68_S0	To meet these expected shortfalls, the 2011 IRP identified a mix of energy efficiency programs, additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and base-load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of PSE s customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P68_S1	The specific resources acquired will be determined through the Company s resource acquisition program which examines specific acquisition and development opportunities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P69_S0	With the planned addition of the Lower Snake River Project Phase 1, PSE has enough renewable resources to meet statutory renewable resource requirements through 2020.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P69_S1	The 2009 and 2011 IRP confirmed that there is a cost benefit to customers of building ahead of renewable need and taking advantage of expiring tax incentives rather than waiting until there is a statutory need to develop more renewable energy.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P70_S0	In 2009, PSE purchased from RES America, Inc., all of the undivided interest in four development-stage wind projects, collectively known as the Lower Snake River wind project in Columbia and Garfield counties in Washington state.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P70_S1	PSE is currently completing construction of Phase 1 of the Lower Snake River wind project, which will total 343 MW of capacity when complete in the first quarter of 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P71_S0	PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P71_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed-price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P71_S2	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P71_S3	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P72_S0	All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P73_S0	For baseload, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in off-peak periods, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P73_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P74_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplant purchases from the U.S.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P74_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P74_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P74_S3	Peaking needs are also met by; using PSE-owned natural gas held in NWP s liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility in Plymouth, Washington; using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; and interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P75_S0	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P75_S1	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P76_S0	During 2011, approximately 49.5% of natural gas supplies purchased by PSE for its gas customers originated in British Columbia, while 14.8% originated in Alberta and 35.7% originated in the United States.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P77_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P77_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during off-peak periods to minimize costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P77_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) whenever on-system customer demand requirements permit and the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S0	PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S2	The facility is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes since it is able to deliver a large volume of natural gas over a relatively short time period.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S3	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE has peak firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 460,000 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, which, after reduction for a portion temporarily released to the power portfolio represents nearly 46.8% of PSE s expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S4	PSE s total firm storage capacity of the facility is in excess of 10 million Dth.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P78_S5	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P79_S0	PSE has been expanding the storage capacity at Jackson Prairie since March 2003.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P79_S1	The most recent withdrawal capacity expansion was placed in service in November 2008 and the reservoir expansion activities will continue through 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P79_S2	The owned storage capacity at Jackson Prairie was 8.4 million Dth at December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P79_S3	Once the expansion activities have been completed in 2012, the capacity will be 8.5 million Dth.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P80_S0	Due to the recent expansion of Jackson Prairie storage withdrawal capacity and storage capacity, PSE s natural gas storage resources are expected to exceed natural gas customer requirements for the next few years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P80_S1	Therefore, beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2014, 50,000 Dth per day of natural gas storage withdrawal capacity and 500,000 Dth of natural gas storage capacity have been temporarily released at market sensitive rates to PSE s power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that is used primarily to reduce portfolio costs through supply management efforts that take advantage of market price volatility, and provides system reliability.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P81_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of one and eight years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P81_S2	PSE s maximum firm withdrawal capacity and total storage capacity at Clay Basin, net of releases, is over 82,000 Dth per day and exceeds 9.8 million Dth, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P82_S0	LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P82_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P83_S0	PSE contracts for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned gas at NWP s Plymouth facility, which is approximately three and one-half day s supply at a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P84_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P84_S1	This propane-air injection facility is designed to deliver the equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P85_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P86_S0	PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P86_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P87_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S0	PSE holds approximately 522,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S1	In addition, PSE holds approximately 524,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie and the Plymouth LNG facility during the heating season.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NWP through various contracts that supply electric generating facilities with approximately 168,000 Dth per day.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S3	PSE participates in the pipeline capacity release market to achieve savings for PSE s customers and has released certain segments of temporarily surplus firm capacity to third parties.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 33 years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P88_S5	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P89_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is approximately 130,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of one to seven years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P89_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling approximately 73,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to seven years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P89_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to 12 years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P89_S3	PSE has annual renewal rights on this capacity.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P89_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity on the GTN pipeline, totaling approximately 90,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of 12 years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S0	The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S3	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S4	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P90_S5	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P91_S0	PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue feasible, achievable cost-effective electric conservation.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P92_S0	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P92_S1	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P92_S2	As described below, PSE recovers the actual costs of electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through a tracker mechanism (for natural gas) and a rider mechanism (for electric).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P92_S3	However, the tracker and rider mechanisms do not provide for any cost recovery of lost sales margin associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P92_S4	A lost margin adjustment is included in PSE s pending general rate case.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P93_S0	PSE s rates are designed to capture most of the approved revenue requirements for fixed costs through volumetric rates.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P93_S1	PSE fully recovers these costs only if its customers consume a certain level of natural gas and electricity.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P93_S2	This level of consumption is typically established in the utility s most recently completed rate case based upon historical natural gas and electric volumes.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P93_S3	When customers use less natural gas or electricity, whether due to conservation, weather or economic conditions, PSE s financial performance is negatively impacted because recovery of fixed costs is reduced in proportion to the reduction in natural gas or electric sales.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P94_S0	Since 1995, PSE has been authorized by the Washington Commission to defer natural gas energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures and recover them through a tracker mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P94_S1	The tracker mechanism allows PSE to defer efficiency expenditures and recover them in rates over the subsequent year.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P94_S2	The tracker mechanism also allows PSE to recover an allowance for funds used to conserve energy on any outstanding balance that is not currently being recovered in rates.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P95_S0	Since May 1997, PSE has recovered direct electric energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through a rider mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P95_S1	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects the efficiency expenditures in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P95_S2	As a result of the rider mechanism, direct electric energy efficiency expenditures are recovered.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P95_S3	PSE does not earn a return on unamortized balances.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P96_S0	PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P96_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_12_ITEM1_P97_S0	PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including seven natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana (Colstrip).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P97_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all have CAA Title V operation permits that must be renewed every five years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P97_S2	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P97_S3	Colstrip represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P98_S0	PSE owns three hydroelectric plants and three wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P99_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P99_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Act.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P99_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P100_S0	PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P100_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE, as well as third party owned properties in which hazardous substances were generated or released.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P101_S0	Cleanup laws PSE may be subject to primarily include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P101_S1	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner, or operator of a contaminated site, as well as, any generator, arranger, transporter or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P102_S0	Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, as well as, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) contaminated wastes.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P102_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and the dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P103_S0	PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water, or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P103_S1	This includes most all generation facilities (all of which have water discharges and some of which have bulk fuel storage), and due to recent changes in state storm water regulations also includes many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P104_S0	In siting new generation, transmission or distribution, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, as well as, other local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P104_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts to the fullest extent possible as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P105_S0	Recent and future environmental law and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on cost of PSE operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P105_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P105_S2	Recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs are described below.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P106_S0	PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P106_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P106_S2	A climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels and PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P106_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional levels.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P106_S4	PSE will also consider the impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P107_S0	Most recent definitive federal legislative activity on climate change occurred in June 2009; the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P107_S1	The bill implements a cap-and-trade system of allowances to reduce GHG emissions 17.0% below 2005 levels by 2020, reaching an eventual target of 83.0% below 2005 levels by 2050.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P107_S2	However, the 111th Congress ended without enacting any major law to limit or reduce GHG emissions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P108_S0	Recent federal climate change regulation includes the Tailoring Rule, which became effective January 2, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P108_S1	Under the rule, new sources that emit more than 100,000 tpv of total GHG and major modifications of existing sources that increase GHG emissions by 74,000 tpv will be required to implement Best Available Control Technology (BACT) to control GHG emissions.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P109_S0	Potential impacts on Colstrip are being evaluated and impacts to our gas fleet cannot yet be determined.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S0	Beginning on March 31, 2011, PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 25,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S1	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S2	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load, which was 21.5 million MWh in 2011, served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S3	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2009 were 14.4 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S4	Since 2009, new PSE generation facilities have resulted in combined GHG emissions of 591,935 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P110_S5	Approximately 36.4% of PSE s total GHG emissions in 2009 (approximately 5.3 million tons) were associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P111_S0	In November 2010, the EPA released two more GHG reporting rules affecting PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P112_S0	The first rule, commonly referred to as Subpart DD, requires owners and operators of electric power system facilities with a total nameplate capacity exceeding 17,820 pounds of sulfur hexafluoride to report emissions from its use of electrical transmission and distribution equipment.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P112_S1	The second rule, commonly referred to as Subpart W, requires certain oil and natural gas operations, including distribution and storage, to report GHG emissions from leaks and certain combustions activities.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P112_S2	PSE will submit the required information as part of its annual filing to the EPA beginning on March 31, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P113_S0	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an essential part of the diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P113_S1	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P114_S0	The state of Montana issued regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired plants in October 2006 (with a limit of 0.9 lbs/Trillion British thermal units (lbs/TBtu) for plants burning coal like that used at Colstrip) which took effect on January 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P114_S1	Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P114_S2	Compliance based on a rolling 12-month average was first confirmed in January 2011 and has continued to meet the requirement during each month of 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P115_S0	The final version of EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standard, (MATS rule) was released December 21, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P115_S1	The final rule provides some concessions to electric generators by providing extra compliance time in certain circumstances, but overall the final rule remains largely consistent with the agency's initial proposal in March 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P116_S0	MATS sets a new federal emission limitation for mercury (1.2 lb/TBtu), for acid gases, for other toxic metal using a particulate matter (PM) surrogate (0.03 lb/MMBtu), and for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides for steam electric generating units.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P116_S1	Colstrip is currently meeting the new mercury standards.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P116_S2	Current emissions and available control technologies are currently being evaluated to determine what will be necessary to meet the new standards for acid gases and PM.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P116_S3	PSE cannot yet determine the outcome of these analyses.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S0	On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S2	In February 2007, Colstrip was notified by the EPA that Colstrip Units 1 2 were determined to be subject to the EPA s BART requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S3	A BART engineering analysis for Colstrip Units 1 2 was submitted in August 2007 and additional requested analyses were submitted in June 2008.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S4	On November 5, 2010, the EPA issued a request for additional reasonable progress information for Colstrip Units 3 4 which has been submitted.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S5	EPA has met with Colstrip representatives to discuss possible requirements for Units 1 2 to meet EPA s BART requirements, but nothing definitive has been determined.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P117_S6	PSE cannot yet determine the outcome of these analyses or information requests.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P118_S0	On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking for the Identification and Listing of Special Wastes: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities which proposes different regulatory mechanisms to regulate coal ash.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P118_S1	The EPA received numerous comments on the respective proposals in November 2010, including comments from PSE and other Colstrip owners.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P118_S2	The EPA has announced that a final rule will not be issued until 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P119_S0	To date, EPA has proposed three regulatory options.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P119_S1	Under the first two options, coal ash could be regulated as a solid waste under Subtitle D provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P119_S2	This would give authority to the states to oversee a set of performance standards for handling and disposal.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P119_S3	Coal ash would be listed as non-hazardous and would allow wet handling to continue, and it would allow continued use of surface impoundments provided they are equipped with protective liners.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P119_S4	One of these two options would require significantly less modifications to closed, as well as, in-use impoundments.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P120_S0	Under the third option, coal ash could be regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C provisions of the RCRA, which would make coal ash subject to a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P120_S1	Regulation under Subtitle C would essentially require the phase-out of wet handling and surface impoundments.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P120_S2	The EPA estimates over 500 surface impoundments would be affected by this ruling.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P120_S3	The EPA is expected to issue a final ruling in late 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P121_S0	Impact to Colstrip operations and PSE, could range from minimal to significant.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P121_S1	Due to the wide range in the options proposed by EPA PSE cannot determine impacts with any more certainty at this time, but we are involved with monitoring development of the final rule and advocating for reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P122_S0	On April 7, 2010, the EPA issued a Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of PCB-containing equipment.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P122_S1	EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P122_S2	This would likely remove all existing use authorizations for PCBs in electrical and gas pipeline equipment.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P122_S3	As proposed, the ANPRM would mandate a phase out of in-service PCBs through a phased process with full removal achieved by 2025.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P123_S0	The end of the comment period for the ANPRM was initially July 6, 2010 but due to the volume of comments received, an extension was granted to August 20, 2010 with the suggested issuance of a Notice in May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P123_S1	PSE provided comments through both the Utilities Solid Waste Advocacy Group (USWAG) as well as the American Gas Association (AGA).
1085392_12_ITEM1_P123_S2	Upon receiving all comments, the EPA has rescheduled the issuance to April 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P123_S3	At this time, PSE cannot determine what the impacts of this ANPRM will have on its operations but will continue to work closely with USWAG and AGA to monitor developments and advocate for a reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P124_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 1, 2012 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P125_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P126_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 1, 2012 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_12_ITEM1_P127_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P3_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic test year costs plus normalized assumptions about rate year power costs, weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Non-energy costs for natural gas retail customers are based on historic test year costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S3	In addition, the Washington Commission decides what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S4	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P6_S5	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE may be unable to acquire energy supply resources to meet projected customer needs or may fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	PSE projects that future energy needs will exceed current purchased and Company owned and controlled power resources.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	As part of PSE s business strategy, it plans to acquire additional electric generation and delivery infrastructure to meet customer needs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	If PSE cannot acquire additional energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could significantly increase its expenses thus reducing earnings and cash flows.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P10_S3	Additionally, PSE may not be able to timely recover some or all of those increased expenses through ratemaking.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	While PSE expects to identify the benefits of new energy supply resources prior to their acquisition and integration, it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such energy supply sources.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, increased customer demand for energy, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Factors which could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its load requirements and/or high volumes of energy purchased in wholesale markets at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods or acts of nature.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If PSE is unable to protect our information technology infrastructure against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	PSE operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S1	Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S2	If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P20_S3	In addition, these cyber-based attacks could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets as well as to supply and price risks affecting PSE s construction and maintenance programs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	In connection with matching loads and resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S1	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S3	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P22_S4	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Further, as a consequence of its electric generation construction and reconstruction programs and investments in its electric and gas distribution systems, PSE contracts to purchase substantial quantities of steel, cable, and similar materials, and thus is subject to supply and price risks affecting these items.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PSE may use forward delivery agreements, swaps and option contracts to hedge commodity price risk with a diverse group of counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P24_S1	However, PSE does not always cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P24_S2	To the extent PSE has unhedged positions or its hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could adversely impact its results of operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, including air and climate protection, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, waste handling and disposal, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	To comply with these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	With respect to endangered species laws, the listing or proposed listing of several species of salmon in the Pacific Northwest is causing a number of changes to the operations of hydroelectric generating facilities on Pacific Northwest rivers, including the Columbia River.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P27_S1	These changes could reduce the amount, and increase the cost, of power generated by hydroelectric plants owned by PSE, or in which PSE has an interest, and increase the cost of the permitting process for these facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or the new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington state has adopted both a renewable portfolio standard and greenhouse gas legislation, including an emission performance standard provision.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S1	PSE cannot yet determine the costs of compliance with the recently enacted legislation.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P29_S3	While PSE cannot yet determine costs associated with these or future decisions or potential future legislation, there may be a significant impact on the cost of carbon-intensive coal generation, in particular.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE s operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	PSE s business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, demand depends heavily on weather patterns in PSE s service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenue is recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	However, conservation efforts may result in decreased customer demand, despite normal or lower than normal temperatures.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Demand for electricity is also greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Accordingly, PSE s operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P31_S5	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond and repair the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, a slow response to extreme events may have an adverse affect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	PSE may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	PSE also hires third parties to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and therefore, continued adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2012 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in general rate cases could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully implement certain technology projects.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	PSE is currently undertaking a multi-year Company-wide business process modernization effort which will replace existing software PSE currently uses for processing customer records and billing, mapping infrastructure assets and handling outage management tasks.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These projects, are expected to be fully deployed by 2013, include: (1) a new Customer Information System intended to replace a PSE application that manages customer information and tracks outages; (2) a new Geospatial Information System intended to replace existing maps of our natural gas transmission and distribution systems with electronic databases; and (3) an Outage Management System expected to augment and improve PSE s ability to pinpoint the sources of electric system outages and respond to them more quickly, focus repair efforts and more accurately predict restoration times.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P41_S2	Implementation of these information systems is complex, expensive and time consuming.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P41_S3	If PSE does not successfully implement the new systems and new processes, or if the systems do not operate as intended, it could result in substantial disruptions to PSE s business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P43_S1	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, of which $864.0 million was outstanding as of February 10, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	PSE has access to three unsecured credit facilities that provide, in the aggregate $1.15 billion in short-term borrowing capability.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P46_S2	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $950.0 million in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2011 had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	limit the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital and the ability to hedge in wholesale markets.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P50_S2	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these taxes.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P54_S4	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Potential legislation and regulatory actions could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank law gave regulators including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission the authority to create new oversight structures for derivative financial instruments, which were widely thought to have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	The new legislation of certain over-the-counter swaps could expand collateral requirements of swaps, which may make it more costly for companies and/or limit the Company s ability to enter into such transactions.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	The Dodd-Frank amended section 2(h)(7) of the Commodities Exchange Act to provide an elective exemption from the clearing requirements of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for any entity that is not a financial entity, is using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and notifies the CFTC, in a manner set forth by the CFTC, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The Company is evaluating the legislation and the CFTC s implementation of it to determine its impact, if any, on the Company s hedging program, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The Company will not know the full impact of the new legislation until the regulations are finalized.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P59_S1	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P59_S3	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution, unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P60_S3	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.2% at December 31, 2011 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.4 to 1.0 for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Gas Supply.
1085392_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of legal proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_12_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal hydroelectric power to residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P1_S1	The program is administered by the Bonneville Power Administration (the BPA).
1085392_12_ITEM3_P1_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P2_S0	In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P2_S1	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the period fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P3_S0	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement that by its terms if upheld in their entirety would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for the period fiscal year 2002-fiscal year 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P3_S1	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into this most recent settlement agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P3_S2	Pending disposition of this challenge, the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits for the period fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 has been stayed by the Ninth Circuit.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P4_S0	Due to the pending and ongoing proceedings, PSE is unable to reasonably estimate any amounts of REP payments either to be recovered by the BPA or to be paid for any future periods to PSE and is unable to determine the impact, if any, these proceedings and litigation may have on PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P4_S1	However, it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through to PSE's residential and small farm customers.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P5_S0	In October 2000, PSE filed a complaint with the FERC (Docket No.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P5_S1	EL01-10) against all jurisdictional sellers in the Pacific Northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result the FERC ordered for the California markets.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P5_S2	The FERC issued an order including price caps in July 2001, and PSE moved to dismiss the proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P6_S0	In response to PSE s motion, various entities intervened and sought to convert PSE s complaint into one seeking retroactive refunds in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P6_S1	The FERC rejected that effort, after holding what the FERC referred to as a preliminary evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P6_S2	On October 3, 2011, after appellate reviews, the FERC issued an Order on Remand and set the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge, but first requiring the parties to engage in settlement talks that began in the fall of 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P6_S3	As such, the hearing date itself is not known.
1085392_12_ITEM3_P6_S4	PSE intends to vigorously defend its position but is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_12_ITEM5_P1_S0	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_12_ITEM5_P1_S1	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM5_P1_S2	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables show selected financial data.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with the Management Discussion and Analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	All of the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its subsidiary PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	Predecessor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE prior to the consummation of the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	Successor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE subsequent to the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P2_S2	The merger was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805.
1085392_12_ITEM6_P2_S3	For a description of this transaction, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S1	The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy and PSE objectives, expectations and intentions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S2	Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S3	However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S4	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S5	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company .
1085392_12_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, Macquarie-FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P3_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE s basis of accounting continues to be on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P3_S4	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	To meet customer growth, to replace expiring power contracts and to meet Washington state s renewable energy portfolio standards, PSE is increasing energy efficiency programs to reduce the demand for additional energy generation and is pursuing additional renewable energy production resources (primarily wind) and base load natural gas-fired generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the prior year, PSE s net income was positively affected by the following four factors; (1) a decrease in net unrealized loss on derivative instruments primarily due to reversal of prior period losses that were settled during the period related to natural gas and power contracts due to declining wholesale electricity and natural gas prices which were slightly offset by losses associated with lower forward wholesale prices of natural gas and electricity; (2) an increase in electric and natural gas retail sales primarily due to cooler temperatures in 2011 as compared to warmer than normal temperatures in 2010 during the first quarter; (3) lower power costs resulting from above-average hydroelectric and wind conditions that positively impacted PSE s electric generation in 2011 as compared to higher costs resulting from below-average hydroelectric and wind conditions in 2010; and (4) an increase in Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) debt and equity components due to higher construction expenditures in 2011 as compared to 2010 which are capitalized to construction projects.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized loss on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	This measure is a supplemental financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The presentation of return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments is intended to supplement readers understanding of the Company s operating performance.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	Return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instrument is used by the Company to determine whether the Company is collecting the appropriate earnings from its customers to allow recovery of investor s capital.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace return on equity (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company has faced certain challenges which caused a significant reduction in the return on equity as compared to other years.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The following table presents PSE s return on equity for 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	Equity adjustments related to backing out the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income, subsidiary retained earnings and retained earnings of derivative instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	The authorized regulated return on equity was approved by the Washington Commission in its general rate case order which became effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Company s 2011 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 6.9%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity due to the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $21 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and gas operations costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	Depreciation expense was $30 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric and common utility capital expenditures placed into service.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	Utility rate making process has a delay between incurring expenses and their recovery in ratebase.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	PSE increased ratebase by $484 million since its last general rate increase effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P18_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase for electric and gas with the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P19_S0	These negative impacts were offset by favorable load which increased natural gas therm sales 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to cooler temperatures in the current year as compared to the same period in prior year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P19_S1	Also, favorable electric power costs had a positive impact on net income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Company s 2010 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 4.1%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity due to the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P21_S0	Electric retail kilowatt sales and natural gas therm sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 declined 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, as compared to historical averages due to warmer temperatures in the first quarter of 2010 which was one of its highest revenue quarters for the year and, to a lesser extent, the impact of PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs, as well as continued effects of weak economic conditions in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P22_S0	The Pacific Northwest experienced below normal hydrological and wind conditions which adversely impacted PSE s power costs in the first quarter of 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P22_S1	Hydroelectric and wind generation for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased by 700,511 MWhs, or 11.8%, as compared to historical averages.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P22_S2	As a result, PSE s power costs in excess of the baseline rate was $29.2 million due to purchasing or generating higher cost electricity to replace the decrease in generation from hydroelectric and wind generating projects.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P23_S0	PSE had requested electric and natural gas rate increases of $110.3 million and $27.2 million, respectively in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Washington Commission approved general rate case increases of $74.1 million and $18.3 million for electric and natural gas customers, respectively which were effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P23_S2	The difference between the allowed and requested increases included a rate of return with a lower equity return and lower equity component than requested, in addition to stricter interpretation of proforma adjustments from what was previously allowed.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P24_S0	As a result of the Washington Commission order of May 20, 2010, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million pre-tax (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), which impacted wholesale energy sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P25_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P26_S0	PSE s regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2012 and future years.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P26_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P26_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales, as well as by its customers conservation investments, which also tend to reduce energy sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P26_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S3	The Washington Commission requires these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S4	cost growth, thus rate increases are required.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S5	If, in a particular year, PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S6	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether expenses and investments are reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P27_S7	If the Washington Commission determines that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard applied, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P28_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P28_S1	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P28_S2	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P29_S0	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P30_S0	PSE had a favorable PCA imbalance for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was $38.1 million below the power cost baseline level, $9.0 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P30_S1	This compares to an unfavorable imbalance of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $7.2 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in electric rates of $160.7 million or 8.1%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S3	On September 1, 2011, PSE filed supplemental testimony to adjust the electric rate increase to $152.3 million, a 7.7% increase, due to changes in projected power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S4	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested electric rate increase to $126.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P31_S5	The $26.3 million reduction was primarily due to updates to power costs and to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P32_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following table sets forth electric rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P34_S0	On March 14, 2011, the Washington Commission issued its order authorizing PSE to increase its natural gas general tariff rates by $19.0 million or 1.8% on an annual basis effective April 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P35_S0	On April 26, 2011, PSE filed a new tariff for a Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Program.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P35_S1	This program is intended to enhance pipeline safety by providing for the timely recovery of the Company s cost to replace certain natural gas system infrastructure that would emphasize system reliability, integrity and safety which would increase natural gas revenue by $1.9 million or 0.2%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P35_S2	The Washington Commission held a hearing on November 17, 2011 and a Commission Order is the next awaited step in the proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P36_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in natural gas rates of $31.9 million or 3.0%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P36_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P36_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P37_S0	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested natural gas rate increase to $28.6 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P37_S1	The $3.3 million reduction was primarily due to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P38_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P39_S0	On October 27, 2011, the Washington Commission approved PSE s PGA natural gas tariff filing effective November 1, 2011, to decrease the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P39_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved charge is a decrease of $43.5 million, or 4.3% annually.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P39_S2	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE s net income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P40_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P40_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P40_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P42_S0	Weather conditions in PSE s service territory have a significant impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE s revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P42_S1	PSE s operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P42_S2	While both PSE s electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P42_S3	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P42_S4	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P43_S0	PSE reported higher customer usage in the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to Pacific Northwest temperatures being 1.54 degrees cooler, as compared to the same period in 2010, which translates to a 13.1% increase in heating degree days.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P44_S0	PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above electric customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P44_S1	PSE also expects energy usage by both residential electric and natural gas customers to continue a long-term trend of slow decline due to continued energy efficiency improvements and the effect of higher retail rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P45_S0	The effects of the current recession on Washington s economy have exacerbated a decline in customer usage throughout 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P46_S0	PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P46_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P46_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company s ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P46_S3	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s credit facilities, the borrowing costs and commitment fees increase as their respective credit ratings decline.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P46_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P47_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P47_S1	PSE s credit facilities expire in 2014 and Puget Energy s credit facility expires in 2017.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P48_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P48_S1	Such regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P48_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality (including climate change) and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation byproducts such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company s operations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P48_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts fulfilling requirements by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates, and on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees in order to comply with these regulatory requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P49_S0	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change and generation byproducts could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P50_S0	As noted in PSE s IRP filed with the Washington Commission, PSE projects future energy needs will exceed current resources from long-term power purchase agreements and Company-controlled power resources.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P50_S1	The IRP identifies reductions in contractual supplies of energy and capacity available under certain long-term power purchase agreements, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P50_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P51_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, significantly increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P52_S0	PSE is investing in its utility infrastructure and customer service functions in order to meet regulatory requirements, serve customers energy needs and replace aging infrastructure.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P52_S1	These investments and operating requirements give rise to significant growth in depreciation, amortization and operating expenses, which are not recovered through the ratemaking process in a timely manner.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P52_S2	This regulatory lag is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P53_S0	Operational Risks Associated With Generating Facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P54_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels, including facility shutdowns due to equipment and process failures or fuel supply interruptions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P55_S1	PSE does not have business interruption insurance coverage to cover replacement power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P56_S0	Energy Efficiency Related Lost Sales Margin.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P57_S0	PSE s sales, margins, earnings and cash flow are adversely affected by its energy efficiency programs, many of which are mandated by law.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company is evaluating strategies and other means to reduce or eliminate these adverse financial effects.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P58_S0	In 2011, as part of the general rate case, a conservation adjustment was proposed to help recover lost margins.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P59_S0	The Company is actively engaged in monitoring the development of the commercial markets for such intangible power attributes as RECs and carbon financial instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P59_S1	The Company supports the development of regional and national markets for such products that are free, open, transparent and liquid.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P60_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P60_S2	Set forth below is the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P61_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P62_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P63_S0	The presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P64_S0	Electric margin and gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P64_S1	PSE s electric margin and gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and gas margin measures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P64_S2	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2010 to 2011 and periods 2009 to 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P66_S0	Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less pass-through tariff items, revenue-sensitive taxes and the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P67_S0	As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P68_S0	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P69_S0	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P70_S0	Electric margin increased $80.9 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P70_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact electric operating revenue and electric energy costs which are included in electric margin:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P71_S0	Electric operating revenue increased $39.8 million, or 1.9%, to $2,147.2 million from $2,107.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P71_S1	The increase in operating revenue of $39.8 million was due to higher electric retail sales of $92.3 million offset by lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $17.2 million and by lower miscellaneous operating revenue of $34.6 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P71_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S0	Electric retail sales increased $92.3 million, or 4.5%, to $2,123.9 million from $2,031.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S1	The increase in electric retail sales was due to a $57.7 million increase in retail electricity usage of 595,487 MWhs, or 2.8%, primarily due to cooler temperatures in PSE s service territory during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S2	The average temperature during the year ended December 31, 2011 was 50.7 degrees, or 1.54 degrees colder than the same period in the prior year, which resulted in a 13.1% increase in heating degree days.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	Additionally, the electric rate increase effective April 8, 2010 contributed $25.9 million to the increase in electric retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	Also contributing to the increase in retail sales were pass-through items with no impact to earnings including a $11.5 million increase in conservation rider program rates, a $7.7 million decrease related to the suspension of the PTC tariff credit effective July 1, 2010, a $4.1 million decrease in the residential exchange rate credit and various other pass-through items.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	PTCs that are generated and provided to customers are recorded as a reduction in other electric operating revenue until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return, at which time the PTCs will be credited to customers in retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S6	Additionally, PSE s customers were credited $10.5 million for REC revenue, effective November 1, 2010, resulting in a decrease in electric retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S7	The $10.5 million credit to customers is offset in other electric operating revenue with no impact to earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P72_S8	PSE s customers continued to receive credits through April 30, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	Sales to other utilities and marketers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales volumes of 687,124 MWhs, or 27.5% which decreased revenue $22.2 million and a decline in wholesale electricity prices which decreased revenue by $12.8 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	Additionally, in the prior year there was a carrying value adjustment of $17.8 million related to PSE s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset that did not occur in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Other electric operating revenue decreased $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in non-core gas sales of $21.7 million and a decrease of $85.5 related to PTCs, partially offset by an increase in REC revenue of $67.0 million, PTCs are deferred until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	As discussed above, REC revenue is an offset of the REC credit provided to PSE s customers in electric retail sales with no impact to earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	Purchased electricity expense decreased $2.0 million, or 0.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P76_S1	The decrease in purchased electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily the result of lower wholesale market prices, which contributed $180.6 million to the decrease.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P76_S2	This decrease was offset by an increase in purchased power of 3,217,631 MWhs, or 23.2%, resulting in an increase of $160.3 million, which was driven by cooler temperatures during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P76_S3	In addition the decrease was offset by an overrecovery of power costs from customers of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, which reduced the customer PCA deferral as compared to an underrecovery of power costs of $7.2 million in the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P76_S4	The overrecovery of power costs was due to above-average hydroelectric and wind generation resulting in decreased power costs associated with purchased electricity and fuel costs of PSE s combustion turbines.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $68.7 million, or 25.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of electricity generation from PSE s combustion turbine facilities as a result of increases in hydroelectric and wind generation of 1,219,910 MWhs, or 19.2%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	Also, coal generation at Colstrip decreased 987,522 MWhs, or 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Generation fuel costs were also lower, due to low wholesale market prices, as it was more economical to purchase wholesale energy than to generate energy from PSE s combustion turbine facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $4.0 million, or 5.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 as a result of lower electric residential and farm customer sales volumes associated with the BPA Residential Exchange Program (REP).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Electric operating revenue increased $8.8 million, or 0.4%, to $2,107.5 million from $2,098.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The increase in operating revenue of $8.8 million was due to higher electric retail sales of $10.1 million and higher miscellaneous operating revenue of $13.7 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	These increases were offset by lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $15.5 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	Electric retail sales increased $10.2 million, or 0.5%, to $2,031.7 million from $2,021.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S1	The increase in electric retail sales was due to a $47.9 million electric rate increase effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S2	Partially offsetting the increase in electric retail sales was an $88.8 million decline in retail electricity usage of 965,695 MWhs, or 4.4%, primarily due to warmer than average temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S3	The average temperature during the first quarter of 2010 was 46.8 degrees, or 6.2 degrees warmer than the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S4	As a result of the warmer first quarter of 2010, heating degree days for the year ended December 31, 2010 were 7.1% lower than the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S5	The decline in retail electricity usage was also due to an increase in PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S6	Also contributing to the increase in retail sales are pass-through items with no impact to earnings including a $22.3 million increase attributable to a decrease in benefits (credits to customers) of the Residential and Small Farm Energy Exchange Benefit, a $20.2 million increase due to conservation rider program rate increases and a $17.0 million increase in retail sales related to the suspension of the PTC tariff effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S7	PTCs that are generated and provided to customers are recorded as a reduction in other electric operating revenue until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return at which time the PTCs will be credited to customers in retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S8	Additionally, PSE s customers were credited $10.5 million for REC revenue effective November 1, 2010, resulting in a decrease in electric retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S9	The $10.5 million credit to customers is offset in other electric operating revenue with no impact to earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P81_S10	PSE s customers will continue to receive credits through March 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Sales to other utilities and marketers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $15.5 million, or 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P82_S2	This decrease was primarily due to a carrying value adjustment of $17.8 million related to PSE s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset and a reduction in sales volumes of 28,981 MWhs, or 1.1% which decreased revenue by $1.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P82_S3	Partially offsetting the decline was an increase in wholesale electricity prices which increased by $3.1 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Other operating revenue increased $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-core gas sales of $9.9 million and REC revenue of $10.5 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	As discussed above, REC revenue is an offset of the REC credit provided to PSE s customers in electric retail sales with no impact to earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Partially offsetting the increase to other operating revenue was $7.3 million of PTCs which are deferred until PSE utilizes tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Purchased electricity expense decreased $113.3 million, or 12.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in purchased power of 1,349,571 MWhs, or 8.9%, resulting in a decrease of $71.6 million and by lower wholesale market prices which contributed $44.5 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P85_S2	The decrease in purchased power for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily the result of lower customer usage related to warmer than normal temperatures during 2010, a weak economy in the Pacific Northwest and 18.7% higher generation of electricity from PSE s coal-fired generation facility, Colstrip, due to Colstrip Unit 4 having an extended outage in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Electric generation fuel expense increased $59.7 million, or 28.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $44.5 million increase in costs at PSE s combustion turbine facilities and a $15.2 million increase related to increased generation at Colstrip in 2010 due to the Colstrip Unit 4 extended outage in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	Also contributing to the increased electric generation fuel expense at company-owned natural gas facilities was an 8.0% decrease in hydroelectric generation by Company-owned facilities and under take-or-pay purchased electricity contracts partially offset by an increase in wind generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $21.4 million, or 22.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of lower electric residential and farm customer sales volumes associated with the BPA REP.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s natural gas margin changes from 2010 to 2011 and 2009 to 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	Gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less pass-through tariff items and revenue-sensitive taxes and the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	Gas margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operations and maintenance expense.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	Gas margin increased $50.9 million and decreased $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact gas operating revenue and gas energy costs which are included in natural gas margin:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Gas operating revenue increased $157.3 million, or 15.6%, to $1,168.9 million from $1,011.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	The increase in gas operating revenue of $157.3 million was due primarily to higher natural gas retail sales of $156.9 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Natural gas retail sales increased $156.9 million, or 16.0%, to $1,139.6 million from $982.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	The increase consists of $132.6 million due to an increase in gas therms of 131.3 million, or 12.5% as a result of cooler temperatures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	Also contributing is an increase of $42.5 million due to a 1.8% increase in natural gas general rate effective April 8, 2010 and a 0.8% PGA rate increase effective November 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P96_S3	The increase was offset $10.9 million due to a 4.3% PGA rate decrease effective November 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	PSE s net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Purchased gas expense increased $86.2 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	The increase was primarily due to higher natural gas costs reflected in PGA rates effective November 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	In addition, an increase in customer usage of 12.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010 contributed to the increase of costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	The PGA mechanism provides the rates used to determine natural gas costs based on customer usage.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	The rate increase was the result of increasing costs of wholesale natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	The PGA mechanism payable balance at December 31, 2011 was $25.9 million as compared to a receivable balance of $6.0 million at December 31, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S4	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S5	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P99_S6	A payable balance reflects overrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	Gas operating revenue decreased $213.2 million, or 17.4%, to $1,011.5 million from $1,224.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	The decrease in gas operating revenue of $213.2 million was due primarily to lower natural gas retail sales of $209.7 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	Natural gas retail sales decreased $209.7 million, or 17.6%, to $982.7 million from $1,192.4 million during year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	This decrease was primarily due to a $115.4 million decrease in gas operating revenue as a result of PGA rate decreases effective June 1, 2009 and October 1, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	The PGA mechanism passes through to customer increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	PSE s net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	The decrease in natural gas retail sales was also due to a decrease of 87.6 million in natural gas therm sales, or 7.7%, which decreased revenue by $107.2 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	The decrease was due primarily to warmer than average temperatures in the Pacific Northwest during the first quarter of 2010 as compared to 2009, an increase in PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Purchased gas expense decreased $182.9 million, or 25.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	The decrease was due to a 7.7% decrease in customer usage and natural gas costs reflected in PGA rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	The decrease in customer usage was mainly due to a 7.1% decrease in heating degrees days during 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, the impact of PSE s residential and commercial customer conservation programs and the continued effects of a weak Pacific Northwest economy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The PGA mechanism provides the rates used to determine natural gas costs based on customer usage.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	The rate decrease was the result of declining costs of wholesale natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	The PGA mechanism receivable balance at December 31, 2010 was $6.0 million as compared to payable balance of $49.6 million at December 31, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S5	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P104_S6	A payable balance reflects overrecovery of market natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments decreased by $112.8 million to a loss of $54.1 million in 2011 as compared to a loss of $166.9 million during the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	In 2011, the derivative portfolio experienced a significant number of 2010 contracts settling.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	As those contracts settled, the previous losses recorded in 2010 were reversed resulting in reduced losses between years.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	On July 1, 2009, PSE elected to de-designate its energy related derivative contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The de-designated contracts were physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P107_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market accounting impacts are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P107_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings when the contracts settle or sooner, if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P107_S4	As a result, PSE will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	Over the tenor of PSE s outstanding derivative contracts, the forward wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas declined 25.7% and 23.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense increased $11.2 million, or 2.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	The increase was driven by increases of $11.9 million increase in electric production, $6.2 in administration and general expenses and $1.5 million in gas operations costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	Partially offsetting the increase is a $7.3 million decrease in electric transmission and distribution and a $1.7 million decrease in customer service expenses.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	Depreciation expense increased $7.0 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electrical and common utility capital expenditures placed into service, net of retirements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Conservation amortization increased $17.5 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	The increase was due to a higher authorized recovery of electric and natural gas conservation expenditures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Conservation amortization is a pass-through tariff item with no impact on earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Taxes other than income taxes increased $31.0 million, or 10.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue sensitive taxes due to an increase in retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Other income increased $12.9 million, or 28.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	The increase is primarily due to income related to the equity component of AFUDC.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	AFUDC increased $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting an increase in the average construction work in progress balance in 2011 due primarily to construction of wind and hydroelectric generation construction projects.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	This increase was partially offset by decreases in regulatory interest of $5.4 million, PTC of $1.2 million and conservative incentive of $1.2 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	Interest expense decreased $19.4 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P115_S1	Contributing to the decrease was a increase of $15.8 million in the debt component of AFUDC for the year ended December 31, 2011 which was included as construction expenditures and which was due to an increase in the average construction work in progress balance in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P115_S2	Also contributing to the decrease is $3.2 million due to lower interest expense on the REC liability owed to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	Income tax expense increased $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	The increase was primarily related to higher pre-tax income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments decreased by $168.2 million to a loss of $167.0 million in 2010, as compared to a gain of $(1.3) million in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The loss was primarily due to the decline in wholesale energy prices during 2010 which resulted in unrealized losses on contracts for future deliveries of energy commodities which we record as derivative instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	On July 1, 2009, PSE elected to de-designate its energy related derivative contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	The contracts that were de-designated were physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market accounting impacts are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings when the contracts settle or sooner, if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P118_S4	As a result, PSE will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	Over the tenor of PSE s outstanding derivative contracts, the forward wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas declined 21.0% and 27.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	Merger and related costs associated with the merger with Puget Holdings incurred for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $23.9 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	These costs were due to one-time PSE employee compensation costs, expenses related to the termination of credit agreements, legal fees and deferred compensation liability increases triggered by the merger in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	Pursuant to the Washington Commission merger order commitments, PSE did not seek recovery of these costs in retail rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	Depreciation expense increased $23.2 million, or 8.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	This increase was primarily due to new additions of electric, natural gas and common plant which were placed into service in 2010 and the full year effect of plant placed in service throughout 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	Amortization expense increased $8.1 million, or 12.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 due to the inclusion of Mint Farm and Wild Horse expansion operating and ownership costs in general rates effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	PSE ceased deferral of these costs effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P122_S2	These increases were partially offset by a decrease in software amortization.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Conservation amortization increased $23.6 million, or 35.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	The increase was due to a higher authorized recovery of electric and natural gas conservation expenditures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Conservation amortization is a pass-through tariff item with no impact on earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Taxes other than income taxes decreased $10.8 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sensitive taxes due to lower retail sales which were partially offset by an increase in property taxes.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	Other income decreased $7.7 million, or 14.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P126_S1	The decrease was primarily due to the carrying costs associated with the Mint Farm regulatory asset being included in general rates effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Prior to April 8, 2010, the Mint Farm regulatory asset was accruing interest income as authorized by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	Also contributing to the decrease was a $7.0 million decrease due to the Washington Commission AFUDC.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	These decreases were partially offset by an $8.5 million increase in AFUDC equity income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	Interest expense increased $18.3 million, or 9.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	The increase was primarily due to a write off of a regulatory asset of deferred interest paid to the IRS of $6.9 million related to the Simplified Service Cost Method deduction from prior years which was disallowed in the Washington Commission general rate case order of April 2, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	Also impacting the increase was higher long-term debt outstanding and interest on regulatory liability associated with RECs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	Income tax expense decreased $67.5 million or 99.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	The decrease was primarily related to lower pre-tax income.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	All the operations of Puget Energy are conducted through its subsidiary PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	Predecessor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE prior to the consummation of the merger on February 6, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Successor refers to the operations of Puget Energy and PSE subsequent to the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date with the remaining consideration recorded as goodwill.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S3	The fair values of assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives in a manner that best reflects the economic benefits derived from such assets.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S4	Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P131_S5	Such adjustments to fair value and the allocation of purchase price between identifiable intangibles and goodwill will have an impact on Puget Energy s expenses and profitability.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	Puget Energy s net income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Puget Energy s interest expense includes elimination adjustments of intercompany interest on short-term debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	Puget Energy s net income for 2011 was $123.3 million with operating revenue of $3,318.8 million as compared to net income of $30.3 million with operating revenue of $3,122.2 million for 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P134_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	Net unrealized gain on derivative instruments decreased $70.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, due to the effects of purchase accounting and the fair value amortization of derivative contracts.

1085392_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	Non-utility expense and other costs decreased $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, due primarily to the write down of SO2 emissions allowance inventory of $9.0 million in 2010 that did not occur in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P136_S1	Also contributing to this decrease is a $4.9 million change related to qualified pension plan which resulted in a gain in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Unhedged interest rate derivative expense increased $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, as a result of paying down a portion of a five-year term-loan due February 2014 in December 2010 and during 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The five-year variable rate term-loan was initially fully hedged; however a portion of the hedge was unwound during the current year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	Interest expense increased $54.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010 due to increased out standing debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	In December 2010 and during 2011, Puget Energy issued fixed rate notes with higher interest rates to refinance and extend the debt maturity of a portion of a five-year term-loan due February 2014.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	Income tax expense decreased $46.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the same period in 2010, due primarily to higher pre-tax loss.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	Puget Energy s net income for 2010 was $30.3 million with operating revenue of $3,122.2 million as compared to net income of $186.8 million with operating revenue of $3,328.5 million for 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	Net unrealized gain on derivative instruments decreased $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, as a result of the required recognition of all contracts at fair value as part of purchase accounting, including derivative contracts previously designated as Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	Certain of these contracts were subsequently redesignated as NPNS.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	The unrealized gain represents the change in fair value of derivative contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	Non-utility expense and other costs increased $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due primarily to the write down of SO2 emissions allowance inventory of $7.9 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	Merger and related costs decreased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to one-time merger related costs of compensation triggered by Puget Energy s change of control, excise taxes and financial advisor fees.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	Unhedged interest rate derivative expense increased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to the de-designation of interest rate swaps associated with the portion of the term-loan that was paid off on December 6, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	Charitable contribution expense decreased $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, due to a charitable contribution to the PSE Foundation in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	Interest expense increased $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P148_S1	The increase was primarily due to the write-down of unamortized loan issuance costs associated with the portion of the term-loan paid off on December 6, 2010, business combination fair value amortization adjustments related to PSE s long-term debt and deferred debt costs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	Income tax expense decreased $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income combined with a decrease in the effective tax rate.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	Energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of PSE s obligation to serve retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	As a result, costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	For individual long-term debt maturities, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	For Puget Energy the amount above excludes the fair value adjustments related to the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	Represents operational agreements, settlements and other contractual obligations with respect to generation, transmission and distribution facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	These costs are generally recovered through base retail rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	For additional information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	Pension and other benefit expected contributions represent PSE s estimated cash contributions to the pension plan through 2016.

1085392_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	As of December 31, 2011, PSE has a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million of which $30.0 million was drawn.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2011, PSE had credit facilities totaling $1.15 billion of which $37.5 million had been drawn.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	These facilities consisted of $400.0 million to fund operating expenses, $400.0 million to fund capital expenditures and $350.0 million to support electric and natural gas hedging.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	In addition, a $12.5 million letter of credit was outstanding under the $400.0 million working capital facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate availability under commercial commitments as of December 31, 2011:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	As of December 31, 2011, PSE had credit facilities totaling $1.15 billion of which $37.5 million had been drawn.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	These facilities consisted of $400.0 million to fund operating expenses, $400.0 million to fund capital expenditures and $350.0 million to support electric and natural gas hedging.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P160_S2	In addition, a $12.5 million letter of credit was outstanding under the $400.0 million working capital facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2011, PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million of which $30.0 million was drawn.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had fully drawn on a five-year term-loan with a balance of $298.0 million and incurred a $545.0 million draw under its $1.0 billion Puget Energy capital expenditure facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	PSE s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system and the natural gas and electric distribution systems are designed to meet regulatory requirements, customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P163_S1	Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $976.5 million in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P163_S2	As a result of a general slowing in the economy and changes to the Company s proposed resources, PSE s projected construction expenditures have been reduced.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P163_S3	Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, for 2012, 2013 and 2014 are:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	The program is subject to change to respond to general business, economic and regulatory conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures required to meet future electric capacity supply shortfalls may be funded from a combination of sources that may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	PSE s planned capital expenditures result in a level of spending that will likely exceed its cash flow from operations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P165_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to the capital markets.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $903.4 million, an increase of $327.6 million from the $575.8 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	The increase was primarily the result of the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	PSE s PGA mechanism had a $31.9 million overrecovery from customers during the year ended 2011 as compared to $55.6 million payments to customers related to an over collection of prior year plan-related rates during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow increase of $87.5 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Net income increased $178.0 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	This increase was caused by a non-cash unrealized derivative instruments loss reduction of $112.8 million, which resulted in operating cash flow increase of $65.2 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	Other long term liabilities increased by $28.8 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to an increase of $1.7 million during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow increase of $27.1 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	Material and supplies inventory increased $8.2 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to a decrease of $19.6 million during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow increase of $27.8 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	Accounts payable increased by $0.7 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to a decrease of $25.8 million during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow increase of $26.5 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2011 was partially offset by the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	AFUDC (equity component) decreased cash flows by $32.4 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to a decrease of $12.7 million during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow decrease of $19.7 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P173_S1	AFUDC primarily increased due to an increase in average construction work in progress balances.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	Accounts receivable and unbilled revenue increased by $6.2 million during the year ended 2011 as compared to a decrease of $7.6 million during the same period in 2010, causing an operating cash flow decrease of $13.8 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $144.4 million from the $865.9 million generated in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P175_S1	The increase included $327.6 million from the cash provided by the operating activities of PSE as previously discussed.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P175_S2	Other factors contributing to the increase included the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	Puget Energy s net unrealized loss (gain) on derivative instruments was a loss of $45.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to a loss of $50.5 million in the same period in 2010, causing an increase in cash from operations of $107.4 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	Puget Energy s accrued expenses and other increased by $41.3 million compared to an increase of $10.1 million in the same period in 2010, causing an increase in cash from operations of $26.2 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2011 was partially offset by the following:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	As a result of the merger, $182.7 million in derivative settlement payments were reclassified to financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $371.6 million during the same period in 2010, resulting in a decrease in operating cash flows of $188.9 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P179_S1	This decrease was due to a decline in the number of contracts settled during 2011 as compared to the prior period.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P179_S2	These contracts represent proceeds received from derivative instruments that included financing elements at the merger date.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	Puget Energy s deferred tax savings decreased $27.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period of the prior year, causing a decrease in cash from operations.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P181_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P181_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, PSE had $25.0 million and $247.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P183_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowing under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P183_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2011 and 2010 was 4.39%, and 5.11%, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P183_S3	As of December 31, 2011, PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	PSE maintains three committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that provide, in the aggregate, $1.15 billion in short-term borrowing capability and which mature concurrently in February 2014.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P184_S1	These facilities include a $400.0 million credit agreement for working capital needs, a $400.0 million credit facility for funding capital expenditures and a $350.0 million facility to support energy hedging activities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	PSE s credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P185_S1	The credit agreements also contain financial covenants which include a cash flow interest coverage ratio and, in addition, if PSE has a below investment grade credit rating, a cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio (each as specified in the facilities).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P185_S2	PSE certifies its compliance with such covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P185_S3	As of December 31, 2011, PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	These credit facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed lenders.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S1	The agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and include variable fee levels.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S2	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank s prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon PSE s credit rating.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S3	The working capital facility, as amended, includes a swing line feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $50.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S4	The $400.0 million working capital facility and $350.0 million credit agreement to support energy hedging allow for issuing standby letters of credit.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S5	PSE must also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S6	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE s credit ratings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S7	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 0.85% and the commitment fee is 0.26%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P186_S8	The $400.0 million working capital facility also serves as a backstop for PSE s commercial paper program.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	As of December 31, 2011, $25.0 million was drawn and outstanding under PSE s $400.0 million working capital facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P187_S1	A $12.5 million letter of credit supporting contracts was outstanding under the facility and there were no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program.

1085392_12_ITEM7_P187_S3	No amounts were drawn or outstanding (including letters of credit) under PSE s $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P187_S4	Outside of the credit agreements, PSE had a $5.3 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P188_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P188_S3	At December 31, 2011, the outstanding balance of the Note was $30.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P188_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	At the time of the merger in February 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five-year term-loan and a $1.0 billion capital expenditure facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had fully drawn the five-year term-loan which, after previous repayments, had a remaining outstanding balance of $298.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S2	Also, as of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had drawn $545.0 million under the $1.0 billion capital expenditure facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S3	The term-loan and capital expenditure facility mature in February 2014.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S4	These credit agreements, which in May 2010 were amended to include a provision for the sharing of collateral with note holders, contained usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants similar to those in PSE s credit facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P189_S5	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	On February 10, 2012, Puget Energy entered into a $1.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P190_S1	Initial borrowings under this facility were used to repay debt outstanding under Puget Energy s term loan and capital expenditure facilities and those agreements were terminated.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P190_S2	As a revolving facility, amounts borrowed may be repaid without a reduction in the size of the facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P190_S3	The revolving credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P190_S4	Interest rates may be based on the prime rate or LIBOR, plus a spread based on Puget Energy s credit ratings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P191_S1	At the inception of this facility, $864.0 million was outstanding, the spread over LIBOR was 2.0% and the commitment fee was 0.375%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P192_S1	At December 31, 2011, approximately $448.6 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P193_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P193_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.2% at December 31, 2011 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.4 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P195_S1	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P195_S2	At December 31, 2011, the EBITDA to interest expense was 2.7 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	In accordance with terms of the Puget Energy credit facilities, Puget Energy is limited to paying a dividend within an eight-day period that begins seven days following the delivery of quarterly or annual financial statements to the facility agent.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	Puget Energy is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P196_S2	In addition, in order to declare or pay unrestricted dividends, Puget Energy s interest coverage ratio may not be less than 1.5 to one and its cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio may not be less than 8.25% for the 12 months ending each quarter-end.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P196_S3	Puget Energy is also subject to other restrictions such as a lock up provision that, in certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain cash flow tests, may further restrict Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	The type and amount of future long-term financing for Puget Energy and PSE are limited by provisions in their credit agreements and PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P198_S1	Under its credit agreements, Puget Energy is generally limited to permitted refinancings and borrowings under its credit facilities and by restrictions placed upon its subsidiaries.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P198_S2	One such restriction limits PSE s long-term debt issuances to not exceed $500.0 million per year, plus any amount needed to refinance maturing bonds.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P198_S3	Unused amounts under this limitation may be carried forward into future years.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	Puget Energy s facilities contain a provision whereby additional capital expenditure loans up to $750.0 million may, under certain conditions, be made available after the $1.0 billion capital expenditure commitment has been fully borrowed.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P200_S0	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P200_S1	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2011, PSE could issue:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P201_S0	Approximately $213.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $355.0 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P202_S0	At December 31, 2011, PSE had approximately $5.8 billion in electric and natural gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P203_S0	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P203_S1	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P204_S0	On March 25, 2011, PSE issued $300.0 million of Senior Notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P204_S1	The notes have a term of 30 years and an interest rate of 5.638%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P204_S2	Net proceeds from the note offering were used by PSE to repay short-term debt outstanding under its capital expenditure credit facility, which debt was incurred to fund utility capital expenditures and replenish cash used to repay the February 2011 maturity of $260.0 million medium-term notes with a 7.69% interest rate.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P205_S0	On November 16, 2011, PSE issued $250.0 million of 4.434% Senior Secured Notes at par with a 30-year maturity.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P205_S1	Net proceeds from the note offering were used by PSE to repay short-term indebtedness under the Company s capital expenditure credit facility, which was primarily used to finance new facilities such as the Lower Snake River (LSR) Wind Project.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P206_S0	On November 22, 2011, PSE issued $45.0 million of 4.700% Senior Secured Notes at par with a 40-year maturity.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P206_S1	Net proceeds from the note offering were used to redeem early, on December 23, 2011, $25.0 million of 9.57% first mortgage bonds previously issued under the company s gas mortgage indenture.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P206_S2	The remainder of the proceeds were used to pay down short-term indebtedness under the Company s capital expenditure credit facility.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S0	On June 3, 2011, Puget Energy issued $500.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S1	The notes have a term of 10 years and 3 months and mature on September 1, 2021.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S2	The interest rate on the notes is 6.0%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S3	The notes are secured by an interest in substantially all of Puget Energy s assets, which consists mainly of all the issued and outstanding stock of PSE and the stock of Puget Energy held by Puget Equico.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S4	The notes contain a change of control provision pursuant to which holders of the notes may have the right to require Puget Energy to repurchase all or any part of the notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P207_S5	Net proceeds from the issue of the notes were used to repay a portion of the $782.0 million remaining balance on the $1.225 billion Puget Energy five-year term-loan and retire a portion of the interest rate hedges associated with that loan.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P208_S0	On June 17, 2011, Puget Energy exchanged $449.9 million of its $450.0 million 6.5% senior secured notes that were originally issued in a December 2010 private placement for registered notes.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P209_S0	On August 10, 2011, Puget Energy exchanged $500.0 million of its 6.0% senior secured notes that were originally issued in the June 2011 private placement for registered notes of the same amount.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P210_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P210_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when service is rendered, and includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S1	Unbilled electric revenue is determined by taking system load less estimated losses and billed MWh plus the beginning unbilled MWh balance.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S2	The estimated system loss percentage for electricity is determined by reviewing historical billed MWh to system load.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S3	The estimated unbilled MWh balance is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per MWh.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S4	Unbilled natural gas revenue is determined by taking therms delivered to PSE less estimated system losses, prior month unbilled therms and billed therms.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S5	The estimated system loss percentage for natural gas is determined by reviewing historical billed therms to therms delivered to customers, which vary little from year to year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P211_S6	The estimated current month unbilled therms is then multiplied by an average rate per schedule per therm based on billed revenue for the month.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P212_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P213_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P214_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P214_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 in the amount of $848.1 million and $366.8 million, respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 of $887.6 million and $296.9 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P214_S2	In conjunction with the merger, Puget Energy recognized additional regulatory assets of $297.1 million and liabilities of $1.05 billion, reflecting the regulatory treatment of certain assets and liabilities subject to purchase accounting.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P214_S3	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P215_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P215_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P215_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P216_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P216_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P217_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P217_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Electric Regulation and Rates within Item 1.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P218_S0	Business Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P219_S0	The PGA mechanism passes increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply through to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P219_S1	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P219_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P220_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P220_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P221_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P221_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P222_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P223_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P224_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P225_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P225_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P225_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P225_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P226_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P227_S0	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P228_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P228_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P229_S0	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $3.9 billion at the October 1, 2011 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P229_S1	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.3 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 16.9%.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P230_S0	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $4.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P230_S1	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 7.0%, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P231_S0	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_12_ITEM7_P232_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P232_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P232_S2	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P232_S3	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P232_S4	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P233_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P233_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P234_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P234_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P234_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P234_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P234_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P235_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P235_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P235_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P236_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P237_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P237_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P237_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P237_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P238_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P238_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P238_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P239_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P239_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P239_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P239_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P240_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P240_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P240_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P241_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P241_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P241_S2	For additional information on purchase accounting adjustments and fair value measurements, see Note 3 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P242_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P242_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $6.6 million, expense of $8.0 million and income of $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P242_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 61.0%, 61.1% and 61.2% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P242_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $1.9 million and pension expense of $3.0 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P242_S4	In 2012, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $14.7 million and $9.4 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P243_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_12_ITEM7_P243_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $5.2 million, $4.5 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P243_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $1.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P243_S3	In 2012, it is expected PSE and Puget Energy will recognize $5.0 million of pension expense and $1.0 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P244_S0	PSE has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P244_S1	PSE recognized expense of $0.1 million, expense of $0.1 million and expense of $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P244_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P244_S3	In 2012, it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize expense of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P245_S0	Due to the merger, the pension plan, SERP plan and other poster retirements benefit plans were remeasured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P245_S1	For further information on the business combination, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P246_S0	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P246_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S4	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S5	During 2011, the Company made a cash contribution of $5.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S6	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P247_S7	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2012 are expected to be at least $22.8 million, $6.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7_P248_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_12_ITEM7_P249_S0	For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE is focused on the commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios and related effects noted above, and is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	PSE hedges open gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The objectives of the hedging strategy are to:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Meet the credit, liquidity, financing, tax and accounting requirements of PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	ASC 815 requires a significant amount of disclosure regarding PSE s derivative activities and the nature of such derivatives impact on PSE s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The information in this Item 7A should serve as an accompaniment to Management s Discussion and Analysis and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	PSE employs various portfolio optimization strategies but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	PSE s portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its retail electric customers to volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	PSE s natural gas retail customers are served by natural gas purchase contracts which expose PSE s customers to commodity price risks through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	All purchased natural gas costs are recovered through customer rates with no direct impact on PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Therefore, wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing PSE s energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible and reducing volatility.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S5	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S6	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electricity and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, and floating for fixed swap contracts that are related to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P4_S7	The forward physical electricity contracts are both fixed and variable (at index) while the physical natural gas contracts are variable with investment grade counterparties that do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	To fix the price of natural gas, PSE may enter into natural gas floating for fixed swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P6_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The following tables present the Company s energy derivatives instruments that do not meet the NPNS exception at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings and OCI (for cash flow hedges), see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company had total assets of $6.0 million and total liabilities of $206.9 million related to financial contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical natural gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	All fair value adjustments of derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P9_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P9_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	At December 31, 2011, a hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $46.2 million, with an after-tax impact of $30.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2011 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2011, based on price source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Pricing derived from inputs with internally developed methodologies.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P15_S0	PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P16_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Where deemed appropriate, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P17_S2	As of December 31, 2011, PSE held approximately $11.1 million worth of standby letters of credit in support of various electricity and REC transactions.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P18_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P18_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P18_S2	However, as of December 31, 2011, approximately 96.0% of PSE s energy and natural gas portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 4.0% of PSE s portfolio are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P18_S3	PSE assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P19_S0	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P19_S1	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements - standardized power sales contracts in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements - standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements - standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P19_S2	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the risk of default by allowing a counterparty the ability to make only one net payment.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P20_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P20_S1	Counterparty credit risk impacts PSE s decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P20_S2	A counterparty may have a deterioration of credit below investment grade, potentially indicating that it is no longer probable that it will fulfill its obligations under a contract (e.g., make a physical delivery upon the contract s maturity).
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P21_S0	ASC 815 specifies the requirements for derivative contracts to qualify for the NPNS scope exception.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P22_S0	When performance is no longer probable, PSE records the fair value of the contract on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded in the statements of income.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P23_S0	Accumulated OCI related to cash flow hedges is also impacted by a counterparty s deterioration of credit under ASC 815 guidelines.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P23_S1	If a forecasted transaction associated with the cash flow hedge is probable of not occurring, PSE will reclassify the amounts deferred in accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P24_S0	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P24_S1	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P25_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P26_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e. WSPP, ISDA or NAESB).
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P26_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P26_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P26_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P27_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P27_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and coming up with an average value.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P27_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P28_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P28_S1	Moreover, the Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P29_S0	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of taking into account credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P29_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P29_S2	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P29_S3	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P30_S0	The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, commercial paper and credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S2	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S3	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S4	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had four interest rate swap contracts outstanding with a total notional amount of $1.28 billion.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P31_S5	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S0	In February 2009, Puget Energy entered into the interest rate swap transactions to hedge risk associated with one-month LIBOR floating rate debt.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S1	Subsequently, in order to satisfy a commitment the Company made to the Washington Commission and to mitigate refinancing risk, the Company refinanced a portion of the underlying debt hedged by the interest rate swaps during 2010 and again during 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S2	As a result of refinancing, the Company de-designated the cash flow hedge accounting relationship between the debt and interest rate swaps in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S3	All fair value gains or losses associated with the interest rate swaps subsequent to the de-designation are recorded in earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S4	At December 31, 2011, the outstanding notional balance of the interest rate swaps is $1.28 billion, compared to the variable rate debt balance of only $843 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P32_S5	Under the existing credit agreements, the Company may retain a portion of those swaps that are in excess of the underlying debt (not economic hedges) until June 2012 at which point the Company may decide to unwind or follow other strategies to mitigate the risk of those un-hedged swaps.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P33_S0	During the period in which the Company s interest rate swaps are in excess of the Company s variable rate debt, the Company will be subject to additional interest rate risk.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P33_S1	The Company has settled approximately $277 million of the interest rate swaps on February 15, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P33_S2	The transaction did not impact the consolidated statements of income as the fair value losses for those swaps had already been recorded through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P34_S0	At December 31, 2011, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $52.4 million pre-tax loss.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P34_S1	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P34_S2	The ending balance in OCI includes a loss of $22.4 million pre-tax related to the interest rate swaps designated as marked-to-market during the reporting period.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P34_S3	The OCI balance relates to the loss that was recorded when the cash flow hedge was de-designated in December 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P35_S0	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the one-month LIBOR would change the fair value of the hedged portion of interest rate swaps by $1.2 million, or $0.8 million after tax, recorded in accumulated OCI.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P36_S0	As a result of the cash flow hedge de-designation related to its interest rate swaps, the Company is exposed to additional interest rate risk on the portion of swaps that remain un-hedged.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P36_S1	A hypothetical 10% change in the one-month LIBOR would change the fair value of these specific un-hedged swaps by $0.7 million.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P36_S2	This hypothetical change in fair value would directly impact earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P37_S0	The following table presents Puget Energy s interest rate swaps at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P38_S0	The change in fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2011 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P39_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2011, based on price source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P40_S0	Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P41_S0	Pricing inputs are based on observable market data.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P42_S0	From time to time PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P42_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2011 is a net loss of $6.9 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P42_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $7.3 million in OCI as of December 31, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P43_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Asset Management Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P43_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P44_S0	The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair value of the Company s debt instruments at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM7A_P45_S0	Short-term debt owed by PSE to Puget Energy is eliminated upon consolidation of Puget Energy.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P14_S1	We are dedicated to ensuring that our high standards of financial accounting and reporting as well as our underlying system of internal controls are maintained.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P14_S2	Our culture demands integrity and we have confidence in our processes, our internal controls and our people, who are objective in their responsibilities and who operate under a high level of ethical standards.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common shareholder s equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Puget Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended and for the period from February 6, 2009 through December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S1	In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules of Condensed Financial Information of Puget Energy, Inc. and the schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the period from February 6, 2009 through December 31, 2009, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S2	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S3	The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S4	Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S5	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S7	Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P15_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Puget Energy, Inc.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P21_S9	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P21_S10	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P22_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings), a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P37_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P37_S2	The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P37_S3	ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P37_S4	Puget Energy s consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been segregated to present pre-merger activity as the Predecessor Company and post-merger activity as the Successor Company.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiary, PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P38_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiaries.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P38_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P40_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	PSE capitalizes, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an Allowance For Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	Replacements of minor items of property and major maintenance are included in maintenance expense when the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of utility plant to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	After February 6, 2009, Puget Energy follows the same capitalization policy for utility plan additions as PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P44_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P44_S2	Replacement of minor items is expensed on a current basis.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired are reflected in earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	For Puget Energy, the carrying amount of non-utility property, plant and equipment was remeasured to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	After February 6, 2009, Puget Energy follows the same capitalization policy for non-utility property, plant and equipment as PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P47_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	The depreciation of automobiles, trucks, power-operated equipment, tools and office equipment is allocated to asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P48_S1	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.7%, 2.7% and 2.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; depreciable gas utility plant was 3.5%, 3.6% and 3.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively; and depreciable common utility plant was 11.3%, 11.8% and 9.6% in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P50_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2011 using an October 1, 2011 measurement date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P57_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P58_S2	Changes in these estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P58_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P58_S4	There were no events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2011 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	The cash and cash equivalents balance at Puget Energy was $37.2 million and $36.6 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P59_S2	The 2011 and 2010 balance consisted of cash equivalents, which are reported at cost and approximates fair value, and were $16.8 million and $20.6 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Restricted cash represents cash to be used for specific purposes.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	The restricted cash balance was $4.2 million and $5.5 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	The restricted cash included $0.7 million, in both 2011 and 2010, which represents funds held by Puget Western, Inc., a PSE subsidiary, for a real estate development project.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P60_S3	As of December 31, 2011, other restricted cash includes $2.0 million in a Benefit Protection Trust and $1.5 million in other restricted cash accounts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	PSE records these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of materials and supplies to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	After February 6, 2009, Puget Energy follows the same policy for recording materials and supplies as PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	Fuel and gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P63_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P63_S2	Gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P63_S3	PSE records these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	For Puget Energy, the carrying amount of fuel and gas inventory was remeasured to fair value on February 6, 2009, as a result of purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	After February 6, 2009, Puget Energy follows the same policy for recording additional inventory as PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it were probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P65_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P65_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term assets or liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P66_S1	The exception is the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) which can be a current asset or current liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	Below is a chart with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and the associated time periods:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010 included the following:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) rate proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments as a result of the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	For additional information, see Note 3.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $219.1 million and $193.8 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending principally upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P76_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	The authorized AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) for natural gas and electric utility plant additions based on the effective dates is as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The following table presents the AFUDC amounts:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	Sales to other utilities are recognized in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	Non-utility subsidiaries recognize revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P81_S2	Sales of RECs are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	PSE collected Washington state excise taxes (which are a component of general retail rates) and municipal taxes totaling $252.5 million, $231.1 million and $247.8 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P82_S1	The Company s policy is to report such taxes on a gross basis in operating revenue and taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable as compared to operating revenue.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	Other non-energy receivable balances are reserved in the allowance account based on facts and circumstances surrounding the receivable including, among other things, collection trends, prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and specific customer credit risk, indicating some or all of the balance is uncollectible.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P83_S3	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $8.5 million and $9.8 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	PSE currently has no insurance coverage for storm damage and recent environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	PSE is self-insured for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	For presentation in Puget Energy and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P86_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	PSE has a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity varies from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	All significant variable power supply cost drivers are included in the PCA mechanism (hydroelectric generation variability, market price variability for purchased power and surplus power sales, natural gas and coal fuel price variability, generation unit forced outage risk and wheeling cost variability).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a graduated scale, between PSE and its customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P88_S1	Any unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments accounted for under ASC 815, are deferred in proportion to the cost-sharing arrangement under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	On January 10, 2007, the Washington Commission approved the PCA mechanism with the same annual graduated scale but without a cap on excess power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the annual power cost variability was between $20.0 million and $40.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	Accordingly, PSE and the customer shared the costs in excess of $20.0 million in equal proportion.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	The differences between the actual cost of PSE s natural gas supplies and natural gas transportation contracts and costs currently allowed by the Washington Commission are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P92_S1	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas and transportation costs, and defer, as a receivable or liability, any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in the PGA mechanism rates, including interest.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P93_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE provides natural gas to its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P94_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P94_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas for power are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to companies that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	Prior to July 1, 2010, PTCs that were generated were passed-through to customers in retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P95_S2	After July 1, 2010, PTCs which are generated and owed to customers are recorded as a regulatory liability with a corresponding reduction in electric operating revenue until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return, at which time the PTCs will be credited to customers in retail sales.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P99_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P101_S1	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P101_S2	For additional information, see Note 11.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P102_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P103_S1	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	For additional information, see Note 12.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Company applies the fair value approach to stock compensation and estimates fair value in accordance with provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P105_S1	Effective February 6, 2009, as a result of the merger, all outstanding shares of the Company were accelerated and vested, the stock compensation plan was terminated and there was no stock-based compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P105_S2	The Company recognized $14.5 million of stock compensation expense which was recorded in merger and related costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	PSE funds cash dividends to pay the shareholder of Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	The following non-cash investing and financing activities have occurred at the Company:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	PSE incurred capital lease obligations of $37.9 million for automatic meter reading modules and network for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	PSE did not incur any capital lease obligations for the year ended December 31, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	PSE incurred capital lease obligations of $15.9 million for vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	In connection with the February 6, 2009 merger, Puget Energy assumed $779.3 million of long-term debt in order to pay down PSE short-term debt and assumed $587.8 million of long-term debt to pay off the previous shareholders.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	This amount was included as part of the purchase price consideration.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following tables set forth the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	Intangibles - Goodwill and Other .
1085392_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment .
1085392_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	ASU 2011-08 allows an entity the option to qualitatively assess whether it must perform the two-step goodwill impairment test in FASB ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	An entity has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not (more than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P113_S3	If an entity elects to perform the qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is in excess of its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P113_S4	Otherwise, an entity would perform Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test in ASC 350-20.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, and therefore will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P114_S1	Puget Energy is currently assessing the effects to its impairment testing process, although ASU 2011-08 is not expected to have a significant impact on Puget Energy s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P115_S1	ASU 2011-05 allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P115_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of OCI along with a total for OCI, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P115_S3	ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P115_S4	The amendments to the ASC in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in OCI or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	On December 23, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	This ASU defers the implementation of only those provisions in ASU 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P116_S2	The amendments are intended to allow the FASB time to redeliberate whether it is necessary to require entities to present reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	ASU 2011-12 affects none of the other requirements in ASU 2011-05, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	The amendments in ASU 2011-12 and ASU 2011-05 are effective at the same time and should be applied retrospectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and therefore will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P118_S2	The Company already complies with the presentation requirement, as the Company presents the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of OCI in two separate but consecutive statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P118_S3	Therefore neither ASU 2011-12 nor ASU 2011-05 will have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board on fair value measurement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	Many of the amendments to ASC 820, eliminate unnecessary wording differences between International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and GAAP.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	The ASU expands ASC 820 s existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 by requiring (1) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement, (2) a description of the valuation processes in place, and (3) a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those inputs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P121_S1	In addition, the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position whose fair value must be disclosed.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	Other amendments to ASC 820 include clarifying the highest and best use and valuation premise for nonfinancial assets, net risk position fair value measurement option for financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk, premiums and discounts in fair value measurement, and fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	ASU 2011-04 is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011, and therefore will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2012 for the quarter ending March 31, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P123_S1	Other than the disclosure requirements, ASU 2011-04 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	On December 16, 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	The ASU is the result of a joint project with the IASB designed to enhance and provide converged disclosures about financial and derivative instruments that are either offset on the balance sheet, or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement (or other similar arrangement).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	The ASU does not change the conditions for when offsetting is appropriate in US GAAP.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	In general, an entity should disclose the effect or potential effect of any rights of setoff associated with recognized assets and liabilities within the scope of the ASU.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P125_S1	This information should enable financial statement users to evaluate the impact or potential impact of netting arrangements on its balance sheet.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P126_S1	Retrospective application of the disclosures is required for all periods presented within the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	Other than the disclosure requirements, ASU 2011-11 is not expected to have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	As a result of the merger, Puget Energy is the direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Equico, which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	After the merger, Puget Energy has 1,000 shares authorized, of which 200 shares have been issued at a par value of $0.01 per share.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	At the time of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Puget Energy was cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	The fair value of consideration transferred was $3.9 billion, including funding by Puget Holdings of $3.0 billion, debt of $0.6 billion issued by Puget Energy and $0.3 billion that was the result of the stepped-up basis of the investors previously owned shares.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	The table below is the statement of fair value of assets acquired and accrued liabilities assumed as of February 6, 2009 measured in accordance with ASC 805.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	There were no adjustments subsequent to the merger transaction date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	The following tables present the fair value adjustments to Puget Energy s balance sheet and recognition of goodwill in accordance with ASC 805:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	The carrying values of net utility plant and the majority of regulatory assets and liabilities were determined to be stated at fair value at the acquisition date based on a conclusion that individual assets are subject to regulation by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	As a result, the future cash flows associated with the assets are limited to the carrying value plus a return, and management believes that a market participant would not expect to recover any more or less than the carrying value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P131_S2	Furthermore, management believes that the current rate of return on plant assets is consistent with an amount that market participants would expect.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	ASC 805 requires that the beginning balance of fixed depreciable assets be shown net, with no accumulated amortization recorded, at the date of acquisition, consistent with fresh start accounting.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	Other property and investments includes the carrying value of the investments in PSE subsidiaries and other non-utility assets adjusted to fair value based on a combination of the income approach, the market based approach and the cost approach.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	The fair values of materials and supplies, which included emission allowances, RECs and carbon financial instruments, were established using a variety of approaches to estimate the market price.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	The carrying value of fuel inventory was adjusted to its fair value by applying market cost at the date of acquisition.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	Energy derivative contracts were reassessed and revalued at the merger date based on forward market prices and forecasted energy requirements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating nonperformance risk.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	The fair value of the power contracts will be amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	Other regulatory assets include service contracts which were valued using the income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate over the remaining period of the contract.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	The fair value of leases was determined using the income approach which calculated the favorable/unfavorable leasehold interests as the net present value of the difference between the contract lease rent and market lease rent over the remaining terms of the contracted lease obligation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	The fair value assigned to long-term debt was determined using two different methodologies.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	For those securities which were quoted by a third party pricing service based on observable market data, the best indication of fair value was assumed to be the third party s quoted price.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P141_S1	For those securities for which the third party did not provide regular pricing, the fair value of the debt was estimated by forecasting out all coupon and principal payments and discounting them to the present value at an approximated discount rate based on PSE s risk of nonperformance as of the merger date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	The merger also triggered a new basis of accounting for Puget Energy s postretirement benefit plans sponsored by PSE under ASC 805 which required remeasuring plan liabilities without the five year smoothing of market-related asset gains and losses.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2009, Puget Energy incurred pre-tax merger expenses of $47.1 million primarily related to legal fees, transaction advisory services, new credit facility fees, change of control provisions and real estate excise tax.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	Puget Energy s merger costs in 2009 are not indicative for periods following the acquisition.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	One day prior to the merger, PSE defeased its preferred stock in the amount of $1.9 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P144_S1	In conjunction with the merger on February 6, 2009, Puget Energy contributed $805.3 million in capital to PSE, of which $779.3 million was used to pay off short-term debt owed by PSE, including $188.0 million in short-term debt outstanding through the PSE Funding accounts receivable securitization program that was terminated upon closing of the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P144_S2	An additional $26.0 million of the capital contribution was used to pay change in control costs associated with the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	On January 6, 2012, PSE filed an electric transmission rate case with FERC as well as an increase in ancillary service charges.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P145_S1	PSE is requesting a rate increase of $3.8 million with an effective date of April 1, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P145_S2	In the filing, PSE requested a formula transmission rate for network and point-to-point transmission service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	A formula rate is a fixed methodology for calculating a rate based upon various cost and billing determinant inputs to recover the operating costs of the transmission system.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P146_S1	The formula rate is updated annually and posted on PSE s Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) with an informational filing to FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P146_S2	This streamlined process allows PSE to recover its costs on a timely basis, provides for a transparent process with transmission customers and seeks to ensure that there is no under or over collection.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	Formula transmission rates are encouraged and broadly accepted by FERC.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	The Washington Commission issued a general rate case order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	PSE s storm accounting allows deferral of certain storm damage costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P149_S1	In 2011 and 2010, PSE incurred $4.6 million and $23.5 million, respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $14.0 million was deferred in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P149_S2	There were no costs deferred in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P149_S3	In January 2012, a storm occurred that resulted in PSE incurring storm damage costs of approximately $65.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P149_S4	Of this amount, approximately $55.6 million was deferred as a regulatory asset.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in electric rates of $160.7 million or 8.1%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S3	On September 1, 2011, PSE filed supplemental testimony to adjust the electric rate increase to $152.3 million, a 7.7% increase, due to changes in projected power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S4	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested electric rate increase to $126.0 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P150_S5	The $26.3 million reduction was primarily due to updates to power costs and to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), a limited-scope proceeding, was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P153_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a general rate case.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	On May 21, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that authorizes the deferral of a settlement payment of $10.7 million incurred as a result of the recent settlement of a lawsuit in the state of Montana over alleged damages caused by the operation of the Colstrip Montana coal-fired steam electric generation facility (Colstrip).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P154_S1	The payment was expensed pending resolution of the accounting petition.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P154_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission allowed recovery of $8.4 million in PSE s operating costs, which represents the amount of the settlement, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	On November 5, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing the deferral and recovery of interest due the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2001 to 2006 along with carrying costs incurred in connection with the interest due.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	In October 2005, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing the deferral and recovery of costs associated with increased borrowings necessary to remit deferred taxes to the IRS.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P156_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission denied recovery of the interest due to the IRS.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P156_S2	PSE expensed the interest deferral of $6.9 million in April 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	On November 6, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing accounting treatment and amortization related to payments received for taking assignment of Westcoast Pipeline Capacity.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P157_S1	The accounting petition seeks deferred accounting treatment and amortization of the regulatory liability to power costs beginning in November 2009 and extending over the remaining primary term of the pipeline capacity contract through October 31, 2018.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P157_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the deferral of $7.5 million and amortization as proposed.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	On April 17, 2009, the Washington Commission issued an order approving and adopting a settlement agreement that authorized PSE to defer certain ownership and operating costs related to its purchase of the Mint Farm Electric Generating Station (Mint Farm) that were incurred prior to PSE recovering such costs in electric customer rates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	Under Washington state law, a jurisdictional electric utility may defer the costs associated with purchasing and operating a natural gas plant that complies with the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performance standard until the plant is included in rates or for two years from the date of purchase, whichever occurs sooner.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the prudence of the Mint Farm acquisition and recovery of the deferred costs from the plant s in-service date to the date of the order.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P159_S2	The deferred costs are to be amortized over 15 years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P159_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the balance of the regulatory asset, net of amortization was $26.3 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	On March 13, 2009, PSE filed with the Washington Commission an application for authority to sell and transfer certain assets related to the Company s White River Hydroelectric Project (the Project) to the Cascade Water Alliance (CWA).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	PSE also requested in its application that the Washington Commission waive applicable provisions of the Revised Code of Washington and Washington Administrative Code with regard to certain surplus property related to the Project, which PSE expects to sell in the near future but which is not part of the CWA transaction.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P160_S2	On May 14, 2009, the application for authority to transfer certain assets to CWA was approved by the Washington Commission and the application for waiver with regard to the Surplus Property was denied and requires PSE to seek approval prior to the sale of any property.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	On September 30, 2009, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission authorize PSE to normalize over 10 years a Treasury grant of $28.7 million received under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 associated with the Wild Horse expansion project.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P161_S1	Treasury grants are tax free grants related to certain renewable energy infrastructure that are available in lieu of the PTC allowed under the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P161_S2	The Washington Commission issued an order approving the accounting petition on December 10, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	On October 16, 2009, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission authorize the deferral and recovery of incremental costs associated with protecting the Company s infrastructure, facilitating public safety, and preparing PSE s electric and natural gas system in the Green River Valley flood plain in anticipation of release of water from the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Howard Hanson Dam (Dam).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P162_S1	In the event of actual flooding, PSE also petitioned the Washington Commission to allow the deferral of costs associated with the repair and restoration of any electric and gas system infrastructure affected by a flood.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	On January 28, 2010, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request for authorization to defer the costs associated with restoring the Company s infrastructure, facilitating public safety, and repairing the Company s electric and natural gas system in the Green River Valley flood plain in the event evacuation is required or flooding occurs due to operations associated with the Dam.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P163_S1	This authorization is conditioned on PSE incurring incremental operation and maintenance costs in excess of $5.0 million per year associated with repair or restoration of the Company s systems around the Green River.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P163_S2	The Washington Commission s order will be effective until the date the Corps confirms that the Dam has been permanently repaired and that Corps operations will return to normal.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how REC proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	The order required REC proceeds to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest at the Company s approved after-tax rate of return.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P164_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for the use of $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P164_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company s RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	The Company s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE s approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P166_S1	The petition is still pending approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	PSE has a tariff which passes the benefits of the PTCs to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	The tariff is not subject to the sharing bands in the PCA.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	Prior to July 1, 2010, PSE could adjust the PTC tariff annually based on differences between the PTC credits provided to the customers and the PTC credits actually earned, plus estimated PTC credits for the following year, less interest associated with the deferred tax balance for the PTC credits.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	Since customers received the benefit of the tax credits as they were generated and the Company did not receive a credit from the IRS until the tax credits were utilized, the Company will be reimbursed for its carrying costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P168_S2	PSE was reimbursed for carrying costs through December 31, 2011 when the credits that were provided and not used were fully received from customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	Effective July 1, 2010, the Washington Commission approved a change in PSE s PTC tariff as PSE has not been able to utilize PTCs since 2007, due to insufficient taxable income caused primarily by bonus tax depreciation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	The Washington Commission approved PSE suspending its PTC tariff, effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P169_S2	This resulted in an overall increase in PSE s electric rates of 1.7%; however, this will not result in an increase in earnings as the benefit of PTCs will pass-through to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P169_S3	The tariff also addresses additional federal incentives and therefore has been renamed the Federal Incentive Tracker.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	On September 22, 2010, a joint proposal and accounting petition was filed with the Washington Commission by PSE, Washington Commission Staff and Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities which addressed how to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addresses REC proceeds to be returned to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	On October 26, 2010, the Washington Commission issued an order granting the joint proposal and accounting petition.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P170_S2	The order allows the Company to credit customers for REC revenue received and deferred through November 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P170_S3	This credit was set to reduce rates by $27.7 million, or 2.9%, over five months beginning November 2010 through March 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P170_S4	RECs received after November 2009 will be retained by PSE and will be used to recapture the benefit of PTCs previously provided to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of PTCs, the PTCs will pass-through to customers following the year in which they are able to be utilized on PSE s tax return, rather than in the same year in which they are generated by qualifying wind powered facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (Section 1603) authorizes the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) to make grants to corporations who place specified energy property in service provided certain conditions are met.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Wild Horse expansion facility was placed into service on November 9, 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P172_S2	The Wild Horse facility was expanded from 229 megawatts (MW) to 273 MW through the addition of wind turbines.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P172_S3	On December 22, 2009, PSE filed an application with the U.S. Treasury to request a grant on the expansion in the amount of $28.7 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	Section 1603 precludes a recipient from claiming PTCs on property for which a grant is claimed.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P173_S1	On February 19, 2010, the U.S. Treasury approved the grant and payment was received in February 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	On December 30, 2010, the Washington Commission approved revisions to PSE s Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2011, which changed the methodology by which federal benefits are passed-through to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P174_S1	The rate schedule will pass-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million Treasury Grant in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P174_S2	The order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the Treasury Grant on an annual basis and includes 23 months of Treasury Grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represents the month the Treasury Grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P174_S3	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3%, with no impact to net income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	In 2002, the Washington Commission approved a PCA mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity varies from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P175_S1	On January 10, 2007, the Washington Commission approved the continuation of the PCA mechanism under the same annual graduated scale but without a cap on excess power costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	All significant variable power supply cost variables (hydroelectric and wind generation, market price for purchased power and surplus power, natural gas and coal fuel price, generation unit forced outage risk and transmission cost) are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a calendar year basis, between PSE and its customers on a graduated scale.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	For a discussion of the accounting policy and PCA graduated scale, see Note 1.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in natural gas rates of $31.9 million or 3.0%, to be effective May 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42%, or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P178_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested natural gas rate increase to $28.6 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P179_S1	The $3.3 million reduction was primarily due to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26%, or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	Hearings related to this matter were held on February 14 through 17, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	On April 26, 2011, PSE filed a new tariff for a Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Program.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P181_S1	This program is intended to enhance pipeline safety by providing for the timely recovery of the Company s cost to replace certain natural gas system infrastructure that would emphasize system reliability, integrity and safety which would increase natural gas revenue by $1.9 million or 0.2%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P181_S2	The Washington Commission held a hearing for November 17, 2011 and a Commission Order is the next awaited step in the proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	On March 14, 2011, the Washington Commission issued its order authorizing PSE to increase its natural gas general tariff rates by $19.0 million or 1.8% on an annual basis effective April 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually or $10.1 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P183_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	On October 27, 2011, the Washington Commission approved PSE s PGA natural gas tariff filing effective November 1, 2011, to decrease the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P184_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved charge is a decrease of $43.5 million, or 4.3% annually.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P184_S2	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE s net income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P185_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P185_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	The following table sets for PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P187_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P187_S1	At December 31, 2011, approximately $448.6 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P188_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P188_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P188_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.2% at December 31, 2011 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.4 to one for the 12 months ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P189_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities pursuant to which, PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P190_S1	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P190_S2	The EBITDA to interest expense was 2.7 to one for the 12 months ended December 21, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	In accordance with terms of the Puget Energy credit facilities, Puget Energy is limited to paying a dividend within an eight-day period that begins seven days following the delivery of quarterly or annual financial statements to the facility agent.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P191_S1	Puget Energy is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P191_S2	In addition, in order to declare or pay unrestricted dividends, Puget Energy s interest coverage ratio may not be less than 1.5 to one and its cash flow to net debt outstanding ratio may not be less than 8.25% for the 12 months ending each quarter-end.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P191_S3	Puget Energy is also subject to other restrictions such as a lock up provision that, in certain circumstances, such as failure to meet certain cash flow tests, may further restrict Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P193_S1	The following table indicates the Company s percentage ownership and the extent of the Company s investment in jointly owned generating plants in service at December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P193_S2	These amounts are also included in the Utility Plant table above.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	There were no valuation adjustments to asset retirement obligations (ARO) in conjunction with the merger in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P194_S1	The Company recognized a new ARO in 2011 in the amount of $0.4 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P194_S2	The Company did not recognize any new AROs in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	The following table describes all changes to the Company s ARO liability:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which were not recognized at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	a legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	an obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	an obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P236_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P236_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing PSE s energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible and reducing volatility in costs and margins in the portfolio.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P237_S0	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P237_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into physical and financial transactions which are appropriate for the service territory of PSE and are relevant to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P239_S5	The amount of losses reclassified from OCI to earnings as a result of de-designated cash flow hedges specific to transactions that are probable of not occurring during 2011 for Puget Energy and PSE was $18.4 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P240_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, commercial paper, and credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P240_S2	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P240_S3	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P240_S4	As of December 31, 2011, Puget Energy had four interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S0	In February 2009, Puget Energy entered into the interest rate swap transactions to hedge risk associated with one-month LIBOR floating rate debt.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S1	Subsequently, in order to satisfy a commitment the Company made to the Washington Commission and to mitigate refinancing risk, the Company refinanced a portion of the underlying debt hedged by the interest rate swaps during 2010 and again during 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S2	As a result of refinancing, the Company de-designated the cash flow hedge accounting relationship between the debt and interest rate swaps in 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S3	All fair value gains or losses associated with the interest rate swaps subsequent to the de-designation are recorded in earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S4	At December 31, 2011, the outstanding notional balance of the interest rate swaps is $1.28 billion, compared to the variable rate debt balance of only $843 million.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P241_S5	Under the existing credit agreements, the Company may retain a portion of those swaps that are in excess of the underlying debt (not economic hedges) until June 2012 at which point the Company may decide to unwind or follow other strategies to mitigate the risk of those un-hedged swaps.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P242_S0	During the period in which the Company s interest rate swaps are in excess of the Company s variable rate debt, the Company will be subject to additional interest rate risk.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P242_S1	The Company has settled approximately $277 million of the interest rate swaps on February 15, 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P242_S2	The transaction did not impact the consolidated statements of income as the fair value losses for those swaps had already been recorded through earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Company refinanced the remaining $843 million of outstanding variable rate debt on February 10, 2012 in order to further stagger debt maturity dates.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P243_S1	Since the refinancing replaced debt with like debt, the original hedged forecast interest payments are still probable of occurring and there is no anticipated reclassification of existing amounts deferred in accumulated OCI to earnings as a result of this transaction.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P243_S2	Puget Energy recorded a $21.2 million loss related to the swaps to interest expense during 2011.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P257_S0	On July 1, 2009 all electric and gas related cash flow hedge relationships were de-designated.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P257_S1	Subsequent measurements of fair value are recorded through earnings, not OCI.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P258_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P259_S0	A reclassification of a loss in OCI increases accumulated OCI and decreases earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P259_S1	Amounts reported are in pre-tax dollars.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P260_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P261_S0	The balances associated with the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Predecessor basis were eliminated as a result of push-down accounting effective February 6, 2009, when the Successor period began.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P262_S0	A reclassification of a loss in OCI increases accumulated OCI and decreases earnings.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P263_S0	The following table presents the effect of hedging instruments on PSE s OCI and statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P264_S0	On July 1, 2009 all electric and gas related cash flow hedge relationships were de-designated.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P264_S1	Subsequent measurements of fair value are recorded through earnings, not OCI.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P265_S0	Changes in OCI are reported in after-tax dollars.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P266_S0	A reclassification of a loss in OCI increases accumulated OCI and decreases earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P266_S1	Amounts reported are in pre-tax dollars.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S0	For derivative instruments that meet cash flow hedge criteria, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S1	Gains and losses on the derivatives representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S2	Puget Energy expects that $14.0 million of losses in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S3	PSE expects that $12.9 million of losses in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S4	The maximum length of time over which Puget Energy and PSE are hedging their exposure to the variability in future cash flows extends to February 2015 for purchased electricity contracts and to October 2015 for gas for power generation contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P267_S5	For Puget Energy interest rate swaps, the maximum length of forecasted transactions deferred in OCI extends to February 2014.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P268_S0	The following tables present the effect of Puget Energy s derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on income during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P269_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $11.7 million of amortization expense related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the merger and subsequently designated as NPNS.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P270_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $40.6 million of amortization expense related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the merger and subsequently designated as NPNS.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P271_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $41.7 million of amortization expense related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the merger and subsequently designated as NPNS and $(2.6) million related to hedge ineffectiveness.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P272_S0	Differs from the amount stated in the statements of income as it does not include $(1.0) million related to hedge ineffectiveness.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P273_S0	The following table presents the effect of PSE s derivatives not designated as hedging instruments on income during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P274_S0	The Company had the following outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2011:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P275_S0	Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P276_S0	Unrealized gains (losses) on gas derivatives are offset by a regulatory asset or liability in accordance with ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P277_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P278_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P278_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring, and exposure mitigation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P279_S0	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial problems.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P279_S1	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P279_S2	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P280_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P280_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P280_S2	However, as of December 31, 2011, approximately 99.9% of the Company s energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 0.1% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P280_S3	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P281_S0	The Company generally enters into the following master agreements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements standardized power sales contract in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P281_S1	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offset of monthly payments and, in the event of counterparty default, termination payments.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P282_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA, or NAESB).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P282_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P282_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P282_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P283_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P283_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and coming up with an average value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P283_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P284_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P284_S1	Moreover, the Company applies its own default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net liability position.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P285_S0	Credit reserves are booked as contra accounts to unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P285_S1	As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P286_S0	The majority of the Company s derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P286_S1	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post any additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P286_S2	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P287_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company did not have any outstanding energy supply and interest rate swap contracts with counterparties that contained credit risk related contingent features, which could result in a counterparty requesting immediate payment or demanding immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P288_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company s derivative activity at December 31, 2011:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P289_S0	Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions at December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P289_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P290_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating s agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P291_S0	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P292_S0	ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P292_S1	The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P292_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820 are as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P293_S0	Level 1 Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P294_S0	Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P295_S0	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P295_S1	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P296_S0	Level 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P297_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P297_S1	These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P297_S2	Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P298_S0	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P299_S0	Level 3 Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P299_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P300_S0	Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P300_S1	At each balance sheet date, the Company performs an analysis of all instruments subject to ASC 820 and includes in Level 3 all of those instruments whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P301_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P301_S1	If a fair value measurement relies on inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the entire measurement must be placed based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P301_S2	The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P302_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas market from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P302_S1	Those forward price quotes are then used in addition to other various inputs to determine the reported fair value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P302_S2	Some of the inputs include the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), assumptions for time value and also the impact of the Company s nonperformance risk on its liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P303_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the Company considered the markets for its electric and natural gas Level 2 derivative instruments to be actively traded.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P303_S1	Management s assessment is based on the trading activity volume in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P303_S2	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P304_S0	The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Company s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P305_S0	The beginning balance for the Successor period was adjusted to reflect the impact of certain fair value adjustments from the merger transaction.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P306_S0	There were no purchases or issuances for 2011 or prior years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P307_S0	There were no purchases or issuances for 2011 or prior years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P308_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company s consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P309_S0	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in the net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments section in the Company s consolidated statements of income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P310_S0	Certain energy derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because Level 3 inputs are significant to their fair value measurement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P310_S1	Energy derivatives transferred out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were classified as Level 3 at the start of the reporting period for which the lowest significant input became observable during the current reporting period and were transferred into Level 2.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P310_S2	Conversely, energy derivatives transferred into Level 3 from Level 2 represent scenarios in which the lowest significant input became unobservable during the current reporting period.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P310_S3	The Company had no transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P311_S0	The Company has a qualified Employee Investment Plan under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P311_S1	For employees under the Cash Balance formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee retirement plan contribution up to 6% of an employee annual salary and make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P311_S2	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning formula pension plan, PSE will match 55% of an employee s investment plan contribution up to 6% of an employee annual salary.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P311_S3	PSE s contributions to the Employee Investment Plan were $13.5 million, $11.8 million and $11.4 million for the years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P312_S0	The Employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P313_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all PSE employees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P313_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary and years of service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P313_S2	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P314_S0	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for employees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P314_S1	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P314_S2	The insurance premiums are based on the benefits provided during the year, and are paid primarily by retirees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P315_S0	The February 6, 2009 merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings triggered a new basis of accounting for PSE s retirement benefit plans in the Puget Energy consolidated financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P315_S1	Such purchase accounting adjustments associated with the remeasurement of retirement plans are recorded at Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P316_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, net periodic benefit cost and other changes in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P317_S0	A curtailment gain was recognized in OCI due to the plan amendment that ceased SERP benefits for non-officers still in the plan as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P318_S0	The estimated net/(loss) gain and prior service/(cost) credit for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 are $(0.6) million and $2.0 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P318_S1	The estimated net (loss)/gain and prior service (cost)/credit for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 are $(0.7) million and zero, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P318_S2	The estimated net (loss)/gain, prior service cost/(credit) and transition/(obligation) asset for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 are immaterial.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P318_S3	The following tables summarize PSE s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets, net periodic benefit cost and other changes in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P319_S0	A curtailment gain was recognized in OCI due to the plan amendment that ceased SERP benefits for non-officers still in the plan as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P320_S0	The estimated net (loss)/gain and prior service (cost)/credit for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 are $(14.9) million and $1.6 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P320_S1	The estimated net loss/(gain) and prior service (cost)/credit for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 are $(1.4) million and $(0.3) million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P320_S2	The estimated net (loss)/gain for the other postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2012 is $0.2 million and prior service (cost)/credit and transition (obligation)/asset for the other postretirement plans are immaterial.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P321_S0	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2012 are expected to be at least $22.8 million, $6.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P322_S0	As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, PSE recorded a one-time tax expense of $0.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010, related to a Medicare D subsidy that PSE receives.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P322_S1	These subsidies have been non-taxable in the past and will be subject to federal income taxes after 2012 as a result of the legislation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S0	As part of PSE s contract with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 77 union, which took effect September 1, 2010, the benefit calculation formula changed for Company employees covered by the contract.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S1	IBEW represented employees hired after August 31, 2010 and employees not vested in a plan benefit as of July 31, 2010 participate in the cash balance formula of the retirement program, with any accrued benefit converted to a beginning cash balance account.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S2	Employees who were vested in a plan benefit as of July 31, 2010 had a choice to convert to the cash balance formula or remain on a final average earnings formula based on qualified pay and years of service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S3	All employees accruing benefits under the cash balance formula receive the same investment plan match and Company contribution.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S4	Effective December 1, 2010, the IBEW represented employees who accrue benefits under the cash balance formula receive a higher matching contribution and an additional Company contribution as compared to IBEW represented employees who are covered by the final average earnings formula.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S5	These are the same formulas applied to non-union represented employees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S6	IBEW represented employees who were rehired after August 31, 2010, will accrue future benefits under the cash balance formula and will be able to elect to convert their prior benefits to the cash balance formula.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P323_S7	As a result of these changes to the IBEW contract, approximately 88.0% of the employees are in the cash balance formula and approximately 12.0% of the employees are in the final average earnings formula.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P324_S0	In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P325_S0	The Company calculates the present value of the pension liability using a discount rate of 4.75% which represents the single-rate equivalent of the AA rated corporate bond yield curve.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P326_S0	6.50% is the benefit cost discount rate used by Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P326_S1	6.20% is the benefit cost discount rate use by PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P326_S2	The discount rates for the net periodic costs for Puget Energy and PSE were different because of the discount rates in effect as of February 5, 2009, the date of the merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P327_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 7.5% in 2012 grading down to 4.90% in 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P327_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P328_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P328_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P329_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P329_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains/losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P329_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P329_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P330_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P330_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P331_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P331_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P332_S0	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P332_S1	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P333_S0	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2012 are expected to be at least $22.8 million, $6.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P334_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the qualified pension plans for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P335_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the SERP for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P336_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the other benefits for the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P337_S0	Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P337_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P338_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P338_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P339_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P339_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P340_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P341_S0	Effective December 31, 2009, ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P341_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P342_S0	In September 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P342_S1	The standard allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P342_S2	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P343_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan assets that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P344_S0	Non US Equity investments are comprised of a (1) mutual fund; and a (2) commingled fund.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P344_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P344_S2	The investment in the commingled fund is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P345_S0	Domestic large cap equity investments are comprised of (1) common stock, and a (2) commingled fund.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P345_S1	Investments in common stock are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P345_S2	The investment in the commingled fund is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P346_S0	Domestic small cap equity investments are comprised of common stock and are valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P347_S0	The tactical asset allocation investment is compromised of a commingled fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P348_S0	Fixed income securities consist of a mutual fund and corporate bonds.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P348_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P348_S2	The corporate bonds are valued using various valuation techniques such as matrix pricing.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P349_S0	As of December 31, 2011 absolute return investments consist of two partnerships.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P349_S1	The partnerships are valued using the financial reports as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P349_S2	These investments are a Level 3 under ASC 820 because the significant valuation inputs are primarily internal to the partnerships with little third party involvement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P350_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P350_S1	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or which have a maturity date not exceeding thirteen months from the date of purchase.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P351_S0	Level 3 assets for the years ended December, 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P352_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value as of December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P353_S0	This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P353_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P353_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P354_S0	This consists of a deposit fund and a money market fund.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P354_S1	The fair value of the deposit fund is calculated by using the financial reports available as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P355_S0	The money market fund investments are valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P356_S0	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or which have a maturity date not exceeding thirteen months from the date or purchase.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P357_S0	Prior to the merger on February 6, 2009, the Company granted equity awards, including stock awards, performance awards, stock options and restricted stock to officers and key employees of the Company under the Company s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan), approved by the shareholders in 2005.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P357_S1	Any shares awarded were either purchased on the open market or were a new issuance.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P357_S2	With the completion of the merger, all shares outstanding under the LTI Plan were fully vested and settled in cash to plan participants.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P357_S3	Puget Energy paid and recognized $14.5 million of merger expense in connection to the vesting of the LTI Plan shares.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P358_S0	The Company generally awarded performance share grants annually under the LTI Plan to key employees which vested at the end of three years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P358_S1	The number of shares awarded and the amount of expense recorded depended on Puget Energy s performance as compared to other companies and service quality indices for customer service.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P358_S2	Compensation expense related to performance share grants was $9.6 million for 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P359_S0	Performance shares activity from December 31, 2008 to February 5, 2009 was as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S0	Plan participants meeting the Company s stock ownership guidelines could elect to be paid up to 50.0% of the share award in cash.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S1	The portion of the performance share grants that could be paid in cash was classified and accounted for as a liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S2	As a result, the compensation expense of these liability awards was recognized over the performance period based on the fair value (i.e. cash value) of the award, and was periodically updated based on expected ultimate cash payout.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S3	Compensation cost recognized during the performance period for the liability portion of the performance grants was based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of measurement and the number of months of service rendered during the period.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S4	The equity portion was valued based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P360_S5	In connection with the completion of the merger in 2009, all performance shares vested and the Company paid and recognized $9.6 million recorded in merger and related costs for such shares.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P361_S0	In 2002, Puget Energy s Board of Directors granted 40,000 stock options under the LTI Plan and an additional 260,000 options outside the LTI Plan (for a total of 300,000 non-qualified stock options) to the former President and Chief Executive Officer.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P361_S1	These options could be exercised at the grant date market price of $22.51 per share and vested annually over four and five years, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P361_S2	The fair value of the stock option award was estimated at $3.33 per share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P361_S3	The options were cancelled at the time of the merger and $2.3 million was paid in cash to the former President and Chief Executive Officer based on the terms of the merger agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P362_S0	Restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2009 was as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P363_S0	Compensation expense related to the restricted shares was $2.2 million for 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S0	Prior to February 6, 2009, the Company had a non-employee director stock plan for all non-employee directors of Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S1	An amended and restated plan was approved by shareholders in 2005.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S2	Under the plan, non-employee directors received a portion of their quarterly retainer fees in Puget Energy stock except that 100.0% of quarterly retainers were paid in Puget Energy stock until the director held a number of shares equal in value to two years of their retainer fees.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S3	Directors could choose to continue to receive their entire retainer in Puget Energy stock.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S4	The compensation expense related to the director stock plan was $0.4 million in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P364_S5	The director stock plan was terminated on February 6, 2009 by action of the Board of Directors upon completion of the merger and outstanding shares thereunder were settled.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P365_S0	The details of income tax (benefit) expense are as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P366_S0	The following reconciliation compares pre-tax book income at the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the actual income tax expense in the Statements of Income:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P367_S0	The Company s deferred tax liability at December 31, 2011 and 2010 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P368_S0	The above amounts have been classified in the Balance Sheets as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in the future years.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S3	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S4	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2026 through 2031.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P369_S5	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2030.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P370_S0	For ratemaking purposes, deferred taxes are not provided for certain temporary differences.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P370_S1	PSE has established a regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through future rates related to those temporary differences for which no deferred taxes have been provided, based on prior and expected future ratemaking treatment.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P371_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P371_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P372_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P372_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P373_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P373_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P374_S0	For ASC 740 purposes, the Company has open tax years from 2006 through 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P374_S1	The Company is under audit by the IRS for tax years 2006 and 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P374_S2	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P375_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal hydroelectric power to residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P375_S1	The program is administered by the Bonneville Power Administration (the BPA).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P375_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P376_S0	In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P376_S1	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the period fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P377_S0	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement that by its terms if upheld in their entirety would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for the period fiscal year 2002-fiscal year 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P377_S1	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into this most recent settlement agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P377_S2	Pending disposition of this challenge, the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits for the period fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 has been stayed by the Ninth Circuit.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P378_S0	Due to the pending and ongoing proceedings, PSE is unable to reasonably estimate any amounts of REP payments either to be recovered by the BPA or to be paid for any future periods to PSE and is unable to determine the impact, if any, these proceedings and litigation may have on PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P378_S1	However, it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through to PSE's residential and small farm customers.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P379_S0	In October 2000, PSE filed a complaint with the FERC (Docket No.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P379_S1	EL01-10) against all jurisdictional sellers in the Pacific Northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result the FERC ordered for the California markets.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P379_S2	The FERC issued an order including price caps in July 2001, and PSE moved to dismiss the proceeding.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P380_S0	In response to PSE s motion, various entities intervened and sought to convert PSE s complaint into one seeking retroactive refunds in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P380_S1	The FERC rejected that effort, after holding what the FERC referred to as a preliminary evidentiary hearing before an administrative law judge.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P380_S2	On October 3, 2011, after appellate reviews, the FERC issued an Order on Remand and set the matter for hearing before an administrative law judge, but first requiring the parties to engage in settlement talks that began in the fall of 2011 and are ongoing.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P380_S3	As such, the hearing date itself is not known.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P380_S4	PSE has not taken any reserve on this matter as it believes it has no exposure, and intends to vigorously defend its position but is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P381_S0	The Company is also involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P381_S1	The Company has recorded a total of $3.8 million and $3.1 million relating to these claims as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P382_S0	In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (ASC 810), a business entity that has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE in its financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P382_S1	A primary beneficiary of a VIE is the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct matters that significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P382_S2	The Company enters into a variety of contracts for energy with other counterparties and evaluates all contracts to determine if they are variable interests.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P382_S3	The Company s variable interests primarily arise through power purchase agreements where it is required to buy all or a majority of generation from a plant at rates set forth in the agreement.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P383_S0	The Company evaluated its power purchase agreements and determined it was not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P383_S1	The Company had previously disclosed two potentially significant variable interests in prior periods; both entities were qualifying facilities contracts that expired at the end of 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P383_S2	The Company requested information from the relevant entities; however, they refused to provide the necessary information, as they were not required to do so under their contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P383_S3	However, if the variable interests had been determined to be VIEs, the Company concluded it would not have been the primary beneficiary of these entities based on available information and it had no exposure to loss on these contracts.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P383_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company s purchased power expense for these entities was $175.9 million, $190.3 million and $181.2 million, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P384_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 24.2% of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately $0.015 per kilowatt hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P384_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to the contractual shares that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P384_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P384_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P401_S1	The Company does not consider any amounts within those ranges as being a better estimate and has therefore accrued $39.1 million and $8.2 million for gas and electric, respectively.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P401_S2	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P402_S2	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P402_S5	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P402_S6	The $30.0 million credit facility with Puget Energy was unaffected by the merger.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P403_S0	On June 3, 2011, Puget Energy issued $500.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P403_S1	Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. acted as a co-manager and underwriter of this issue.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P403_S2	Net proceeds of $484.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding $782.0 million term-loan.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P404_S0	Puget Energy s term-loan and credit facility for funding capital expenditures both mature in February 2014, contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous committed banks and other financial institutions.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P404_S1	One of these banks is Macquarie Bank Limited, which as of December 31, 2011 had commitments of $6.9 million under the term-loan and $50.6 million under the capital expenditure credit facility.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P404_S2	Concurrent with the borrowings under these credit agreements, Puget Energy entered into several interest rate swap instruments to hedge volatility associated with these two loans.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P404_S3	Two of the swap instruments were entered into with Macquarie Bank Limited with a total notional amount of $444.9 million.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P405_S0	At the time of merger, Puget Energy recorded the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_12_ITEM8_P405_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating nonperformance risk.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P405_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P406_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P407_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an on-going basis, whenever events or circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below its carrying value.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P407_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in market price.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P408_S0	Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test as of December 31, 2011 for long-term power purchase contracts.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P408_S3	The carrying value for Rock Island intangible asset contract was $44.9 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be $9.8 million thereby requiring a $35.1 million write-off of the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P409_S0	Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test as of December 31, 2010 for long-term power purchase contracts and SO2 emission allowance assets.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P409_S2	The excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the power contracts was $105.8 million which was written-off against regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2010.

1085392_12_ITEM8_P413_S0	Effective February 6, 2009, all merger related fair value adjustments were retained in Puget Energy.
1085392_12_ITEM8_P413_S1	Accordingly, only the financial statements of Puget Energy were adjusted to reflect the purchase accounting.

1085392_12_ITEM11_P1_S0	This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2011, the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles as of 2011 year end were:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P2_S0	Bertrand A. Valdman, Former Senior Vice President and Former Chief Financial Officer (Former CFO).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P3_S0	During 2011, the following changes occurred among our Named Executive Officers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P3_S1	Effective March 1, 2011, Mr. Reynolds retired as CEO of the Company and Ms. Harris succeeded him as CEO.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P3_S2	On February 2, 2011, Mr. Valdman was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company, succeeding Mr. Markell to that position.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P3_S3	Effective March 11, 2011, Mr. Valdman voluntarily resigned as CFO and Mr. Gaines served as acting Principal Financial Officer until Mr. Doyle s appointment as Senior Vice President and CFO of the Company in November 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P4_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P6_S0	Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P7_S0	Align compensation payment levels with achievement of Company goals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P8_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of executive compensation from its outside compensation consultant, Towers Watson.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P8_S2	The Committee recommends the salary level for our CEO, based on recommendations from Towers Watson, and recommends the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO, to the full Board for approval.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P8_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of awards under those plans.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P9_S0	In 2011, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P10_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total pay opportunity.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P10_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P10_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets base salary and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive pay) to the 50th percentile of this comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P10_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P10_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P12_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P13_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P13_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded solely for meeting and exceeding target levels of annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P13_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P14_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P15_S0	As described below, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S0	Execute the Company s succession planning process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings with her executive team.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and whom have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S3	The talent reviews include evaluations prepared within the Company and by external organizational development consultants.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S4	The Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P16_S5	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P17_S0	A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for achievement of Company goals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P17_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P17_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P17_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not provide an incentive to executives to take unreasonable risks that could have a material adverse effect relating to the Company s business and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P18_S0	The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P18_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P18_S2	Since the Company is no longer publicly listed following its merger in February 2009 and no longer grants equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P19_S0	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group and is also designed to achieve current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P19_S1	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, though long-term incentive programs are designed to comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P19_S2	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P19_S3	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2011 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P20_S0	The Committee annually reviews total compensation opportunity and actual total compensation received over the prior years by each executive officer in the form of a tally sheet.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P20_S1	This review helps inform the Committee s decisions on program designs by allowing the Committee to review overall pay received in relation to Company results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P21_S0	In making compensation decisions on base salary and annual and long-term incentive programs, management prepares comprehensive pay surveys for review by the Committee and the Committee s outside executive pay consultant, Towers Watson.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P21_S1	The Committee also received advice from Towers Watson in making 2011 compensation decisions.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P22_S0	The surveys summarize data provided by the Towers Watson 2010 Energy Services survey for a selection of utility and other companies that are most similar in scope and size to PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P22_S1	For the review of compensation pay levels and practices in 2011, we included the following utility companies in our comparator group that were all of similar scope (generally $1.5 billion $6.0 billion revenue and $4.0 billion $12.0 billion asset size) and also participated in the Towers Watson 2010 Energy Services survey:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P23_S0	Base pay and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive pay) are targeted to the 50th percentile of the industry comparator group if the Company s performance goals are achieved at target.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P23_S1	If results are below expectations, total direct compensation is lower than this targeted level.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P23_S2	If achievement of performance goals significantly exceeds target, total cash compensation can approach the 75th percentile of the industry comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P24_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed to see how they position the executive in relation to the median of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P24_S1	The Company may choose to pay an executive above or below the median level of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P25_S0	We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P26_S0	Base salaries are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of the comparator group and are reviewed annually by the Committee on an individual basis using as a guideline, median salary levels of our comparator group, as well as internal pay equity among executives.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P26_S1	Actual salaries vary by individual and depend on additional factors, such as an individual s expertise, level of performance achievement, level of experience and level of contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P27_S0	The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2011 and, for the first time since 2009, recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P27_S1	Previously executive base salaries had not changed since 2009 in light of the continued difficult economic environment faced by the Company and many of our customers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P27_S2	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries, and base salaries for 2011 generally remained at the median of market among the comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P27_S3	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board were in a range of 2% to 5%, similar to salary increases processed for other non-represented employees.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P28_S0	Effective March 1, 2011, the Board appointed Ms. Harris CEO of the Company and increased her base salary from $680,000 to $720,000.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P28_S1	In establishing the level of pay for Ms. Harris, the Committee recommended and the Board approved a base salary that was below the median of market among the comparator group, reflecting Ms. Harris s new tenure in 2011 as both President and CEO.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P28_S2	Effective November 18, 2011, the Board appointed Mr. Doyle as Senior Vice President and CFO of the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P28_S3	Mr. Doyle s base salary was set at $450,000, slightly below the median of market among the comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P28_S4	Ms. Mellies was promoted to Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer on February 1, 2011 and received a salary increase to $265,000, which placed her slightly below the median of market among the comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P29_S0	Our annual and long-term incentive plans help focus executives on the priorities of our investors and customers and reward performance that meets or exceeds pre-established goals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P29_S1	Both the Company s annual incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan measure and reward the Company s performance on Service Quality Indices (SQIs).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P29_S2	These reporting measures were developed in collaboration with the Company s regulator, the Washington Commission, and provide customers with a report card on the Company s customer service and reliability.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P29_S3	In addition to SQI achievement, performance measures used in 2011 for determining incentives were EBITDA in the annual incentive plan and Total Return in the long-term incentive plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P29_S4	EBITDA and Total Return are important performance measures of economic return to our investors, and their accomplishment indicates to our customers that the Company has the financial strength needed for long-term sustainability.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P30_S0	Based on the recommendations of management and the Committee, the Board approved certain changes to the annual and long-term incentive programs which will take effect in 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P30_S1	Although these changes do not apply to our incentive compensation plans as in effect during 2011, they are described briefly below because they were approved in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P31_S0	All PSE employees, including executive officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P31_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives to executives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P31_S2	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P32_S0	For 2011, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against 9 SQIs covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P32_S1	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P32_S2	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P32_S3	For 2011, the Washington Commission agreed to continued removal of one SQI that had been applicable for prior years relating to limiting disconnects for non-payment; during the Company s current general rate case, the Washington Commission will determine if that measure should be reinstated for future years.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P33_S0	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards .
1085392_12_ITEM11_P34_S0	The SQIs for 2011 were as follows:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P35_S0	The annual incentive plan for 2011 had a funding level based on customer service, as measured by SQI achievement, and EBITDA as shown in the table below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P36_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not exclude any items for 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P37_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on a subjective evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P37_S1	Individual goals were developed from the overall corporate goals for 2011, set forth below:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P38_S0	Enhance Customer Service Respond to our customers by listening, leveraging new systems, updating processes and providing innovative and improved services, products and programs.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P39_S0	Optimize Generation and Delivery Secure and maintain reliable resources, build or replace infrastructure in a way that meets our customers needs, promotes environmental stewardship and provides a fair return to investors.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P40_S0	Be a Good Neighbor Embrace our role as a leader to protect and improve our natural gas and electric service, promote energy efficiency initiatives, encourage corporate giving and instill community involvement.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P41_S0	Value Employees Safety is key; work safely.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P41_S1	Value diversity, teamwork and open communication.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P41_S2	Support employees through technology, process improvement, recognition, training and development.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P41_S3	Strive to make PSE a great place to work.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P42_S0	Own it Conduct ourselves and our business in a manner that is ethical, responsible and meets or exceeds any internal or external compliance obligation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P42_S1	Take personal responsibility for meeting customer needs while using company resources and facilities wisely.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P43_S0	Continue to Learn and Grow Strive to get better at what we do every day.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P43_S1	Continuously examine past practices, challenge our assumptions and apply lessons learned to improve our efforts on behalf of customers and the community.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P44_S0	Achievement of the corporate goals for 2011 was above target for EBITDA, and at target for SQI achievement.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P44_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,022.5 million, and SQI achievement was 9 out of 9, leading to a funding level for 2011 of 121.2%.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P45_S0	For 2011, individual target incentive levels for this plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of base salary as shown in the table below, based on the individual executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P45_S1	With the exception of Ms. Mellies, who received a promotion during 2011, target annual incentive opportunities for participating executives remained unchanged from 2010 levels.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P46_S0	The maximum incentive for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P47_S0	As described above, an executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on a subjective assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P47_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met by each executive, the CEO did not recommend any adjustment to award amounts for the Named Executive Officers (below the CEO) in 2011 , except to recommend an increase in award amount for Mr. Gaines individual performance in 2011, taking into consideration he served as acting Principal Financial Officer for much of the year .
1085392_12_ITEM11_P47_S2	The Board approved the amounts shown below, which were paid in March 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P47_S3	Mr. Reynolds retired with two months of service in 2011 and was not eligible for an annual incentive award.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P47_S4	Mr. Valdman voluntarily terminated employment during 2011 and as a result forfeited eligibility for payment of a 2011 annual incentive award.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P48_S0	Mr. Doyle joined PSE in November 2011 and was not eligible for a 2011 annual incentive.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P48_S1	Mr. Doyle has a target incentive of 45% of base salary in 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P49_S0	As described above, Mr. Reynolds was not eligible for a 2011 annual incentive and Mr. Valdman forfeited eligibility for payment of a 2011 annual incentive.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P50_S0	In addition to the annual incentive program, the Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Doyle, were eligible to receive merger performance bonuses in 2011 under the terms of their Executive Employment Agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P51_S0	During 2011, Company management recommended and the Board approved one change to the annual incentive plan to be effective with the 2012 performance year.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P51_S1	To emphasize the Company s continued commitment to employee safety, the Company added a new safety performance measure to the annual incentive plan funding for 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P51_S2	The employee safety measure will function like the 9 SQIs in determining the funding of the incentive plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P51_S3	In 2012 the annual incentive funding table will require achievement of all 9 SQIs and achievement of the safety measure for 100% funding of the plan at target EBITDA performance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P51_S4	If the safety measure is missed, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P52_S0	The safety performance measure contains five targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be met.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P52_S1	If the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased in the same manner as if an SQI measure is not achieved.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P53_S0	Frontline supervisors receive appropriate safety and health training.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P54_S0	New employees receive applicable safety and health orientation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P55_S0	Actively reduce the risk of ergonomic office injuries.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P56_S0	Reduce the Company Total Incident Case Rate (TICR) by 4% of the year end 2011 TICR.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P57_S0	Reduce the Company Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) by 15% of the year end 2011 LWCR.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P58_S0	Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P59_S0	Prior to completion of our merger in February 2009, executives received equity awards under the Puget Energy 2005 LTI Plan in the form of performance shares and performance-based restricted stock.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P59_S1	Awards generally vested based on the Company achieving a targeted level of performance during a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P59_S2	Upon the merger, all unvested LTI Plan awards accelerated in vesting and became payable in cash in 2009 pursuant to the terms of the LTI Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P59_S3	Following our merger, the Company has continued the basic design of the pre-merger LTI Plan, including retention of three-year performance cycles that begin each year.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P59_S4	Since the Company no longer has publicly listed stock and no longer grants equity awards to its employees, LTI Plan awards are now denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P60_S0	The Board approved a change in performance measures for the 2012-2014 performance cycle, which is described below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P60_S1	The remainder of this section discusses currently outstanding LTI Plan grants under the 2009-2011, 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 performance cycles.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P60_S2	The LTI Plan grants for the 2009-2011 performance cycle vested at the end of 2011 and will be paid in cash in March 2012 based on achieved performance as described below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P61_S0	The Committee determines the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating the actual payment and forecast target payment of long-term incentive awards of our market comparator group for comparable levels of responsibility.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P61_S1	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when granting annual incentive awards or making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P62_S0	Each year s grant is primarily viewed in the context of the compensation opportunity needed to maintain the Company s competitive position relative to the comparator group.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S0	Target LTI Plan awards are calculated based on a percentage of an executive s annual base salary, taking into account the executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S1	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2011-2013 performance cycle were 170% of base salary for Ms. Harris; 110% for Mr. Valdman and Mr. Markell; 95% for Ms. McLain, Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Mellies; and 50% for Mr. Gaines.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S2	Mr. Reynolds was not granted a 2011-2013 LTI Plan grant because he retired effective March 1, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S3	Mr. Valdman s 2011-2013 LTI Plan grant was forfeited when he voluntarily terminated employment on March 11, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S4	In connection with his hire on November 28, 2011, Mr. Doyle received a pro-rata grant of 2011-2013 LTI Plan units based on a target of 95% of base salary.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P63_S5	Details of the number of units granted and expected value can be found in the 2011 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P64_S0	With the exception of Ms. Mellies, who was promoted during 2011, target LTI Plan award opportunities as a percentage of base salary remained unchanged from 2010 levels for the continuing Named Executive Officers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P65_S0	Except for the CEO, 50% of each grant of LTI Plan units is allocated to achievement of SQIs only (SQI component) and 50% is allocated to achievement of a combination of SQIs and Total Return (Total Return component).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P65_S1	The CEO s LTI Plan units are allocated 30% to the SQI component and 70% to the Total Return component to place additional weight on financial measures, consistent with our comparator group companies.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P65_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P65_S3	For the 2011-2013 performance cycle, the initial per unit value was $33.80.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P66_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the actual level of achievement of SQIs and Total Return as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P66_S1	Unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings LLC level and is re-calculated each year based on the change in Total Return for the prior year as measured by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P66_S2	Total Return reflects the annual change in the value of the Company plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P67_S0	For any award to be earned in a performance cycle, average SQI results must meet or exceed 80% accomplishment of the applicable SQIs, which for the 2011-2013 performance cycle are the same SQIs set forth above under 2011 Annual Incentive Compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P68_S0	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, disability or death.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P69_S0	The tables and points below summarize the performance measures and design of the LTI Plan grants for the current performance cycles.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P70_S0	CEO grants are split 30% SQI Component and 70% Total Return Component.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P71_S0	Total Return Component is determined based on a combination of Total Return and 3-year average SQI results.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P72_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards that will be earned based on three-year average SQI achievement.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P73_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return Component that will be earned based on three-year performance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P73_S1	Percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P74_S0	A target number of units are granted under this component at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of 80% of SQIs during the performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P74_S1	The actual award is paid at target level if an average of at least 80% of SQIs are satisfied during the performance cycle, but is not paid if the average is below 80%.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P74_S2	If targeted SQI performance is met, the amount payable is equal to the product of the target number of units granted under this component and the per unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P75_S0	If 80% of SQIs are met during the performance cycle, but the Total Return threshold of 10% is not met, the SQI component will still be paid at target.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P76_S0	A target number of units are granted under this component at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of Total Return and SQI performance during the three-year performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P76_S1	The actual award paid is based on Company performance relative to target, subject to a minimum threshold level of performance of 10% for Total Return (based on average Total Return over the performance cycle) and average SQI achievement of 80%.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P77_S0	The LTI Plan unit value is determined annually by applying the Total Return for each year to the prior year s unit price.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P78_S0	At the completion of the performance cycle, if the Total Return component is paid, the participant receives a cash payment equal to the number of units earned under this component based on performance during the performance cycle multiplied by the unit price at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P79_S0	If the Total Return component exceeds 10% annualized 3-year return, but the SQI threshold is not met, the Total Return component will not be paid.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P80_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2013.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P81_S0	Performance on the SQI component for 2011 was at 9 out of 9, which if continued for the remaining two years of the performance cycle would mean that the SQI component would pay based on the target number of units granted to a Named Executive Officer.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P82_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2011 was 6.6%, below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P83_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2012.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P84_S0	Performance on the SQI component of the grant was at 9 out of 9 in both 2010 and 2011, which if continued for the remaining year of the performance cycle would mean that the SQI component would pay based on the target number of units granted to a Named Executive Officer.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P85_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2010 was 7.1% and during 2011 was 6.6%, for a combined two-year average of 6.8%, below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P86_S0	Following his retirement, Mr. Reynolds received a pro-rated payment of $150,204 for 2010 under the 2010-2012 performance cycle, based on actual performance for 2010 under the performance cycle and a per unit price of $33.80, as determined as of the end of 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P87_S0	The 2009-2011 performance cycle has now ended and had the performance described below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P88_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the table below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P89_S0	As described above, the LTI Plan structure from 2009 through 2011 maintained the basic design which had been in place prior to the Company s merger in 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P90_S0	Effective with the 2012-2014 LTI Plan grants, the Board has approved a modification to the performance measures of the LTI Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P90_S1	Under this modification, SQI achievement has been removed as a performance measure from the 2012-2014 performance cycle in favor of two financial performance measures, Total Return and Return on Equity.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P90_S2	Other aspects of the program, such as three-year performance cycles and the target levels of grants, remain unchanged.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P90_S3	The Board modified the performance measures and related levels of achievement percentages that trigger payouts in order to ensure that the LTI Plan continues to be viewed as an incentive by the participants and aligns the interests of participants with those of our investors.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P91_S0	The Total Return performance measure continues as a key measure of the LTI Plan, with the revised achievement percentage scale shown in the table below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P91_S1	This modified scale is intended to expand the range of performance that will trigger plan funding.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P91_S2	The SQI factor of the Total Return component has been removed to make the plan easier to understand and to remove the duplication of rewards based on SQI performance, since SQI performance is already factored into the annual incentive plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P92_S0	A new Return on Equity (ROE) scale has been added as the second LTI Plan performance measure.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P92_S1	It replaces the SQI performance measure and means that both LTI Plan performance measures are financial in nature.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P92_S2	The Board felt that ROE was an appropriate measure to add, since Company management has been tracking ROE and seeking to improve Company results on this measure.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P93_S0	The ROE performance is measured each year by comparing actual ROE to the approved financial plan s ROE for that year.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P93_S1	The average of each year during the three-year performance cycle will determine the final ROE award.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P93_S2	The ROE scale is shown below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P93_S3	With the implementation of solely financial performance measures, the President and CEO position will receive grants of LTI Plan units with a 50%/50% split between Total Return and ROE, like all other LTI Plan participants.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P93_S4	Named Executive Officers received 2012-2014 LTI Plan grants of units in the amounts and at grant values shown in the footnote to the Summary Compensation Table 2011 Grants of Plan Based Awards.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P94_S0	The Company maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for executives to provide a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P94_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P94_S2	All the Named Executive Officers except Mr. Reynolds participate in the SERP.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P94_S3	When Mr. Reynolds was hired, he elected to receive an annual contribution to his account in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees in lieu of participating in the SERP, as described in the following paragraph.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P94_S4	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2011 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P95_S0	The currently serving Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P95_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonus and LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P95_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P95_S3	Prior to 2012, the interest crediting fund was based on corporate bond rates, but effective for deferrals after December 31, 2011, it will be based on a money market rate.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P96_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P96_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P96_S2	Under the terms of Mr. Reynolds employment agreement, he additionally received an annual Company contribution to his Deferred Compensation Plan account equal to 15% of the base salary and annual incentive payment he received during the prior year.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P96_S3	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2011 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P97_S0	The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain of its current executive officers that provide for certain payments and benefits if an executive s employment is terminated or terminates for certain reasons, such as following a change in control.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P97_S1	The Company entered into these agreements for two primary reasons.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P98_S0	First, many executives when joining a new company require a level of assurance that they will receive pay in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control after they join the company.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P98_S1	Second, the Company provided these agreements so that executives are focused on the Company s ongoing operations and are not distracted by the employment uncertainty that can arise in the event of a change in control.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P98_S2	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the comparator group considering benchmarking information provided by Towers Watson.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P98_S3	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S0	Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company), which amended and restated existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the executives.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provided for an employment period of two years following the February 6, 2009 completion of the merger and generally provided benefits similar to those under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S2	In addition, the agreements provided for a merger performance bonus equal to 100% of the executives annual base salary, payable on or shortly following each of the first and second anniversaries of the completion of the merger if the Company achieves specified minimum SQI performance goals established by the Committee (for 2010, 80% of SQIs or better) and the executive remains employed at the Company until the anniversary of the merger for which payment is made.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S3	In February 2011, Ms. Harris, Mr. Markell, Ms. McLain, Mr. Wiegand, Ms. Mellies, Mr. Gaines, and Mr. Valdman each received merger performance bonuses in the amounts set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S4	Under the terms of the employment agreements, the executives are not eligible to receive additional merger performance bonuses in future years.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P99_S5	Since the 2009 merger, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P100_S0	Mr. Reynolds employment agreement terminated effective February 28, 2011 in connection with his retirement as CEO.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P101_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 30, 2011, the last business day of 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P102_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and perquisites targeted to competitive practices.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P102_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P102_S2	In connection with the November 2011 hire of Mr. Doyle, the Company provided a payment for relocation expenses, as described in the Other Compensation Table to the Summary Compensation Table below.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P102_S3	The terms of the payment require Mr. Doyle to pay it back if he resigns or is terminated for cause within twenty-four months of hire.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S0	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S1	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S2	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services, business club memberships and executive physicals up to an annual limit.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S3	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S4	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for individual use of club facilities.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P103_S5	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and, other than the relocation amount paid to Mr. Doyle, do not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P104_S0	A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P104_S1	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value incentive opportunity for annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target level award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P104_S2	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P105_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P106_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P107_S0	The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P107_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P108_S0	The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P108_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P109_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P109_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 for filing with the SEC.

1085392_12_ITEM11_P112_S1	Club use is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P112_S2	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P113_S0	Includes Company contributions during 2011 to PSE s Investment Plan (a tax qualified 401(k) plan) and the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P113_S1	For Mr. Reynolds, this includes the Company contribution to the Deferred Compensation Plan equal to 15% of Mr. Reynolds base salary and annual incentive for the prior year, $199,906, which is described in more detail in the 2011 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.

1085392_12_ITEM11_P115_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2011 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P115_S1	Mr. Reynolds did not receive grants in either plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P115_S2	Mr. Valdman received grants, but forfeited them when he resigned.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P116_S0	The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P116_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P116_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P116_S3	Except as described below in footnote 1, relating to Mr. Reynolds, each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P117_S0	Mr. Reynolds participated in the Retirement Plan, but not the SERP.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P117_S1	In lieu of participating in the SERP, each year Mr. Reynolds account under the Deferred Compensation Plan was credited with an amount equal to 15% of his base salary and annual incentive for the preceding year.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P117_S2	The value of this deferred compensation account at December 31, 2011 of $881,207 is also shown in the 2011 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P118_S0	The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P118_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P119_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2011 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P119_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are 4.0% for 2012 and are assumed to average 5.0% annually thereafter.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P119_S2	The discount assumption is 4.75%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2012 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 2.06%, 5.25% and 6.32% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2011).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2010 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2010.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S3	These assumptions included assumed average cash balance interest credits of 4.0% for 2011 and 5.5% for all future years, a discount assumption of 5.15% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2011 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 3.78%, 6.31% and 6.57% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2010).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P120_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2010 were the same as those used for December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P121_S0	As described in footnote 2 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P121_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P122_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P122_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Dan Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S0	Under the Retirement Plan, Puget Energy s and PSE s eligible salaried employees, including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S3	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S4	For 2009 through 2011, the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit was $245,000.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P123_S5	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P124_S0	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P124_S1	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P124_S2	For 2011 and 2012 the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S4	This reduction is subsidized that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P125_S7	As of December 31, 2011, all the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P126_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P126_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P127_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P127_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P127_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P127_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P127_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P128_S0	If a participant in the cash balance portion of the Retirement Plan dies while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, then his or her Retirement Plan benefit will be immediately vested.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P128_S1	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P128_S2	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P129_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P129_S1	Ms. Harris, Mr. Doyle, Mr. Markell, Ms. McLain, Mr. Wiegand, Ms. Mellies, and Mr. Gaines participate in the SERP.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P129_S2	Mr. Valdman participated in the SERP prior to his voluntary resignation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P129_S3	Mr. Reynolds did not participate in the SERP prior to his retirement.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P130_S0	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P130_S1	All the participating Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P130_S2	Mr. Valdman voluntarily resigned in March 2011 and will be entitled to receive his SERP benefit beginning at age 62.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P131_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a vested executive (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P132_S0	One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P132_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three calendar years of earnings.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P132_S2	The three calendar years do not have to be consecutive, but they must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P132_S3	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P133_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P133_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P134_S0	The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, and includes amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P135_S0	The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the Annual Cash Balance Restoration Account).
1085392_12_ITEM11_P135_S1	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2010 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P136_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P136_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P136_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P136_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P136_S4	Mr. Markell, Ms. McLain, and Mr. Wiegand are the only Named Executive Officers eligible for early retirement benefit payments under the SERP as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P137_S0	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P137_S1	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P137_S2	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P137_S3	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P138_S0	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding aggregate executive and Company contributions and aggregate earnings for 2011 and year-end account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

1085392_12_ITEM11_P140_S2	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation table for 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P141_S0	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P141_S1	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation table for 2011.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P142_S0	Mr. Reynolds retired on March 1, 2011 and received a distribution of a portion of his deferred account, per his prior election.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P142_S1	The December 31, 2011 balance shown for Mr. Reynolds will be distributed in accordance with his prior election.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P143_S0	Mr. Valdman voluntarily resigned in March 2011 and per the terms of the plan for a participant not eligible for retirement, received a distribution of the entire account balance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P144_S0	Of the amounts in this column, the following amounts have also been reported in the Summary Compensation table for 2011, 2010, and 2009.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P145_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan grants.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P145_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P145_S2	The Annual Investment Plan Restoration Amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P145_S3	The Annual Cash Balance Restoration Amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P145_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P146_S0	Mr. Reynolds did not participate in the SERP during his tenure with PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P146_S1	In lieu of such participation, each year Mr. Reynolds account under the Deferred Compensation Plan was credited with an amount equal to 15% of Mr. Reynolds base salary and annual bonus for the preceding year.

1085392_12_ITEM11_P147_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P147_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and interest crediting.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P147_S2	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P147_S3	The 2011 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_12_ITEM11_P148_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P148_S1	Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P149_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P150_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P151_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P151_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P151_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P151_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P152_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P152_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_12_ITEM11_P152_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).

1085392_12_ITEM11_P167_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.

1085392_12_ITEM13_P6_S0	When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including:
1085392_12_ITEM13_P7_S0	Whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P8_S0	If any related person transaction is not approved or ratified, the Committee may take such action as it may deem necessary or desirable in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P9_S0	Kimberly Harris, who serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a director of Puget Energy and PSE, is married to Kyle Branum, a principal at the law firm Riddell Williams P.S. since 2008.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P10_S0	Riddell Williams or its predecessor firms have been one of PSE s primary law firms for nearly 50 years.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P10_S1	In 2011, Riddell Williams was paid $1.63 million for legal services provided to PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P10_S2	Mr. Branum is among the lawyers at Riddell Williams who provide legal services to PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P10_S3	This work was performed under the direct supervision of the office of the general counsel and the compensation arrangements were comparable to other regional law firms providing legal services to PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P11_S0	Puget Energy is party to interest rate swap agreements, negotiated under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. ( ISDA agreements ), with various parties, including Macquarie Bank Limited.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P11_S1	Affiliates of Macquarie Bank Limited indirectly own an equity interest in PSE.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P12_S0	The ISDA agreements were the product of arms' length negotiations between Puget Energy and the various counterparties, including Macquarie Bank Limited, and contain terms and conditions similar to those of other master swap agreements with unrelated third parties.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P13_S0	The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P13_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, William Ayer (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Mary McWilliams (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Melanie Dressel (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), and Herbert Simon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P14_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P14_S1	The Company s definition of Independent Director is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P15_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P15_S1	The Board has also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P15_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P16_S0	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P17_S0	Messrs. Ayer and Simon, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P17_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P17_S2	In addition, PSE has entered into transactions with entities for whom Mr. Simon serves as a director or officer, or in which he otherwise has a financial interest, that involve amounts that are less than the greater of $1.0 million or 1% of those entities consolidated gross revenue.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P17_S3	These transactions fall within the second categorical standard described above.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P17_S4	Because these relationships either fall within the Board s categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P18_S0	Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P18_S1	Mr. Ayer, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.
1085392_12_ITEM13_P19_S0	Interested parties may communicate with the non-management directors of the Board through the procedures described in Item 10 of Part III of this annual report under the section Communications with the Board.

1085392_12_ITEM14_P4_S1	The policies are designed to ensure that the provision of these services does not impair the firm s independence.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P4_S2	Under the policies, unless a type of service to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by an Audit Committee.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P4_S3	In addition, any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by an Audit Committee.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S0	The annual audit services engagement terms and fees, as well as any changes in terms, conditions and fees relating to the engagement, are subject to specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S1	In addition, on an annual basis, the Audit Committee grants general pre-approval for specific categories of audit, audit-related, tax and other services, within specified fee levels, that may be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S2	With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide detailed back-up documentation to the Audit Committee regarding the specific services to be provided.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S3	Under the policies, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of their members.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S4	The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decision to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P5_S5	The Audit Committee does not delegate responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management.
1085392_12_ITEM14_P6_S0	For 2011 and 2010, all audit and non-audit services were pre-approved.

1085392_13_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P1_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	Corporate Strategy Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	The following table presents the number of PSE customers as of December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	During 2012, PSE s billed retail and transportation revenue from electric utility operations were derived 52.8% from residential customers, 40.6% from commercial customers, 5.2% from industrial customers and 1.4% from other customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P6_S1	PSE s retail revenue from natural gas utility operations were derived 66.5% from residential customers, 29.2% from commercial customers, 2.9% from industrial customers and 1.4% from transportation customers in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P6_S2	During this period, the largest customer accounted for approximately 1.6% of PSE s operating revenue.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	PSE is affected by various seasonal weather patterns and therefore, utility revenue and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	Energy usage varies seasonally and monthly, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	PSE experiences its highest retail energy sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	Sales of electricity to wholesale customers also vary by quarter and year depending principally upon fundamental market factors and weather conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	PSE has a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE also has a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism in retail electric rates to recover variations in electricity costs on a shared basis with customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	In the five-year period ended December 31, 2012, PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.9 billion and retirements were $327.5 million.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	In the same five-year period, PSE s gross natural gas utility plant additions were $790.5 million and retirements were $111.9 million and PSE s gross common utility plant additions were $330.5 million and retirements were $327.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P10_S2	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2012 was approximately $9.0 billion, which consisted of 35.5% distribution, 38.2% generation, 12.2% transmission and 14.1% general plant and other.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	was approximately $3.0 billion, which consisted of 93.0% distribution and 7.0% general plant and other.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2012 was approximately $555.5 million.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Employees At December 31, 2012, Puget Energy had no employees and PSE had approximately 2,800 full-time employees.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	Approximately 1,200 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire September 30, 2013 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Corporate Location Puget Energy s and PSE s principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Item 10 Part III of this annual report.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	REGULATION AND RATES PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE's approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how Renewable Energy Credit (REC) proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The order required REC proceeds net of applicable costs to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P17_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P17_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company's RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Company's California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	The Washington Commission ordered that parties provide recommended methods for passing back the remaining deferred proceeds.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Commission approved a joint proposal that allowed a portion of the REC proceeds received by PSE to offset the PTCs that had been passed through to customers but have not been used by PSE on its tax return, and after completion of the PTC offset, the Commission allowed PSE to offset the REC liability against rate base and amortize the balance of RECs at the beginning of a given rate year over five years as a credit to cost of service.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's electric general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	The rate increases for electric customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S3	PSE's requested treatment of the prepayments made to BPA, filed in May 2010, was approved in the order.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S4	The final order rejected PSE's proposed conservation savings adjustment.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S5	Finally, a new rate rider for Renewable Energy Credits ( RECs ) was proposed by settlement of Electric parties and approved by the Washington Commission in the final order.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P19_S6	The new rate rider replaced prospectively what was required pursuant to the Commission's orders in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.

1085392_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	Average usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	ELECTRIC SUPPLY At December 31, 2012, PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,977 megawatts (MW).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments that may include, but are not limited to, weather-related hedges.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	_______________ Net of 38 MW of capacity delivered to Canada pursuant to the provisions of a treaty between Canada and the United States and Canadian Entitlement Allocation agreements.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	Power received from other utilities and firm contracts are classified between hydroelectric and other producers based on the character of the utility system used to supply the power or, if the power is supplied from a particular resource, the character of that resource.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	Company Owned Electric Generation Resources At December 31, 2012, PSE owns or controls the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 3,513 MW:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	_______________ Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility was operated pursuant to 50-year license granted by the FERC in October 2008.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	The license provides protection and enhancements for fish and wildlife, water quality, recreation and cultural and historic resources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	The FERC jurisdictional facility was operated pursuant to 40-year license granted by the FERC in June 2004.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	Snoqualmie Falls will have partial output upon completion of powerhouse 2 anticipated for March 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	The plant is expected to be fully operational and provide a net maximum capacity of approximately 54 MW upon completion of powerhouse 1 expected in the second quarter of 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	At December 31, 2012, Electron project output is limited to approximately 7 MW due to the condition of the flume that conveys water to the plant.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	This limitation is expected to continue into 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts During 2012 , approximately 17.5% of PSE s energy requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P36_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	_______________ Douglas County PUD received a new 40-year FERC license for the Wells Project in November 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	PSE s share of power under the 2001 contract will decline over time as Grant County PUD s load increases.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	PSE s share of both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum developments was 0.9% at the end of 2012 and will not be less than 0.6% through 2052.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P40_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the BPA (for 41 aMW of capacity) and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	Further, PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S5	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S6	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S7	In 2012 , PSE had 4,417 MW and 596 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P41_S8	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	During 2012 , approximately 93.0% of natural gas for power purchased by PSE for power customers originated in British Columbia and 7.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file electric and natural gas Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) every two years with the next IRP scheduled to be filed by May 30, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	As part of the resource acquisition process, PSE filed and conducted a Request-for-Proposal (RFP) process in 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P45_S1	The 2011 RFP updated the assumptions from the 2011 IRP and identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	These expected shortfalls reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2011 IRP.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	In response to the RFP, PSE received and evaluated 29 resource proposals.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	After the selection through the RFP process, PSE acquired the 270 MW Ferndale natural gas fuel power plant and executed a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia for the purchase of up to 380 MW of coal transition power (the Centralia agreement).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S2	PSE filed a petition for approval of the Centralia agreement and the recovery of related acquisition costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S3	On January 9, 2013, the Commission issued an order granting PSE's petition which contained conditions that have left PSE with a level of uncertainty such that it would terminate the contract.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S4	PSE subsequently filed for reconsideration of the order and the various stakeholders have until March 8, 2013 to respond to the PSE's petition.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S5	The Commission has indicated it will rule on PSE's petition by March 29, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P47_S6	Providing PSE's petition for reconsideration is approved, as a result of the proposed Centralia agreement and the addition of the Ferndale plant, PSE expects to have sufficient resources to meet its capacity needs over the next few years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed-price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P48_S3	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	_______________ All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	For baseload, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in off-peak periods, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in NWP s liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage facility near Plymouth, Washington; using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; and interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S4	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S5	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S6	During 2012 , approximately 51.0% of natural gas supplies purchased by PSE for its gas customers originated in British Columbia, while 20.0% originated in Alberta and 29.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S7	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S8	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during off-peak periods to minimize costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P51_S9	Natural gas is marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) whenever on-system customer demand requirements permit and the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes since it is able to deliver a large volume of natural gas over a relatively short time period.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	Dekatherm (Dth) per day, which, after reduction for a portion temporarily released to the power portfolio and to a third party represents nearly 46.7% of PSE s expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S2	PSE s total firm storage capacity of the facility is approximately 9.8 million Dth.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S3	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S4	The owned storage capacity at Jackson Prairie is now 8.5 million Dth.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S5	Due to the recent expansion of Jackson Prairie storage withdrawal capacity and storage capacity, PSE s natural gas storage resources are expected to exceed natural gas customer requirements for the next few years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S6	Therefore, through 2014, 50,000 Dth per day of natural gas storage withdrawal capacity and 500,000 Dth of natural gas storage capacity have been temporarily released at market rates to PSE s power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P53_S7	In addition, PSE has permanently released 3,500 Dth per day and temporarily released approximately 6,000 Dth per day of Jackson Prairie Storage firm withdrawal capacity (and associated storage capacity) in exchange for permanent and temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that is used primarily to reduce portfolio costs through supply management efforts that take advantage of market price volatility, and provides system reliability.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of five and seven years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	PSE s maximum firm withdrawal capacity and total storage capacity at Clay Basin, net of releases, is over 74,000 Dth per day and exceeds 8.8 million Dth, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	PSE contracts for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned gas at NWP s Plymouth facility, which is approximately three and one-half day s supply at a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P57_S1	This propane-air injection facility is designed to deliver the equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system, but is not currently in use, awaiting further reliability and safety upgrade.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	Natural Gas Transportation Capacity PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Spectra's Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	PSE holds approximately 523,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S2	In addition, PSE holds approximately 520,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie and the Plymouth LNG facility during the heating season.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S3	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NWP through various contracts that supply electric generating facilities with approximately 168,000 Dth per day.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S4	PSE participates in the pipeline capacity release market to achieve savings for PSE s customers and has released certain segments of temporarily surplus firm capacity to third parties.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S5	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 32 years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P60_S6	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is approximately 130,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to six years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling approximately 106,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to six years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to eleven years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P61_S3	PSE has annual renewal rights on this capacity.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P61_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity on the GTN pipeline, totaling approximately 90,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of 11 years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P62_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P63_S1	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P63_S2	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	ENERGY EFFICIENCY PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue feasible, achievable cost-effective electric conservation.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P64_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P64_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	PSE recovers the actual costs of electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through a tracker or rider mechanism, as applicable, (for natural gas) and a rider mechanism (for electric).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	However, the tracker and rider mechanisms do not provide for any cost recovery of lost sales margin associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P65_S2	To address this issue, PSE has proposed a decoupling mechanism in an accounting petition that is currently before the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	PSE s rates are designed to capture most of the approved revenue requirements for fixed costs through volumetric rates.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	PSE fully recovers these costs only if its customers consume a certain level of natural gas and electricity.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	This level of consumption is typically established in the utility s most recently completed rate case based upon historical natural gas and electric volumes.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	When customers use less natural gas or electricity, whether due to conservation, weather or economic conditions, PSE s financial performance is negatively impacted because recovery of fixed costs is reduced in proportion to the reduction in natural gas or electric sales.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	Since May 1997, PSE has recovered direct electric energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through a rider mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects the efficiency expenditures in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	As a result of the rider mechanism, direct electric energy efficiency expenditures are recovered.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P67_S3	PSE does not earn a return on unamortized balances.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	For gas conservation expenditures through 2011, PSE was authorized by the Washington Commission to defer natural gas energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures and recover them through a tracker mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	The tracker mechanism allowed PSE to defer efficiency expenditures and recover them in rates over the subsequent year.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	The tracker mechanism also allowed PSE to recover an allowance for funds used to conserve energy on any outstanding balance that was not currently being recovered in rates.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Beginning with 2012 gas conservation expenditures, PSE has been authorized by the Washington Commission to recover its direct natural gas energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through a rider mechanism similar to the electric rider mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P69_S1	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects the efficiency expenditures over a one-year period.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P69_S2	As a result of the rider mechanism, direct natural gas energy efficiency expenditures are recovered.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P69_S3	As a result of converting to a rider mechanism, PSE no longer earns a return on unamortized balances.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	ENVIRONMENT PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P70_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all have CAA Title V operation permits that must be renewed every five years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P71_S2	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P71_S3	Colstrip represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P72_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P73_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P73_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Act.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P73_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P74_S0	Remediation of Contamination PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P74_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE, as well as third party owned properties in which hazardous substances were generated or released.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P75_S0	The primary cleanup laws PSE is subject to include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P75_S1	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner, or operator of a contaminated site, as well as, any generator, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P76_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, as well as, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) contaminated wastes.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P76_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and the dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P77_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water, or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P77_S1	This includes most generation facilities (and all those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P78_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, as well as, other local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P78_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts to the fullest extent possible as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P79_S0	RECENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND REGULATION Recent and future environmental law and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on cost of PSE operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P79_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P79_S2	Recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs are described below.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P80_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P80_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P80_S2	A climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels and PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P80_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P80_S4	PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S0	The Tailoring Rule, which became effective January 2, 2011, sets permit levels for GHG emissions in two phases for power plants and other large stationary sources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S1	The ruling limits the amount of GHG emissions a facility can emit by requiring installment of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S2	Phase I requires existing facilities that emit more than 100,000 tons of emissions per year to comply with the new BACT rules when air permits are renewed or when major modifications are made after January 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S3	Phase II, which begins after July 2011, requires preconstruction permits using BACT for new projects that emit 100,000 tons of emissions per year or existing projects that make major modifications and that emit more than 75,000 tons per year.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S4	Currently the EPA has only released BACT guidance for coal technology.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S5	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work to determine natural gas turbine BACT guidance is ongoing.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P81_S6	Potential impacts on Colstrip are being evaluated and impacts to our gas fleet cannot yet be determined.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P82_S0	On March 27, 2012 EPA proposed a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) to limit carbon dioxide from new fossil fuel-fired electric generation units.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P82_S1	The proposed standard would only apply to new generating units.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P82_S2	The EPA did not propose standards for existing fossil fuel power plants, nor did it indicate a timeline for proposing these in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P82_S3	The proposed output-based standard for new units is 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (MWh).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S0	Each year, PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the State of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the EPA.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S4	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2011 were 10.4 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S5	Approximately 43.0% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.5 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S6	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an essential part of the diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P83_S7	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P84_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P84_S1	Compliance based on a rolling 12-month average was first confirmed in January 2011 and has continued to meet the requirement.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P85_S0	EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS rule) in February 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P85_S1	The MATS rule establishes numerical emissions limitations at coal-fired power plants for mercury (1.2 lb/TBtu), acid gases, certain toxic metals using a particulate matter surrogate (0.03 lb/MMBtu), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P85_S2	Generating units have 3 years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P85_S3	Colstrip currently meets the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases and is conducting testing to determine what is needed to allow compliance with particulate surrogate for other metals.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P85_S4	PSE cannot determine the outcome at this time.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P86_S0	Additional Colstrip Emission Controls On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P86_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P86_S2	The final Regional Haze/BART FIP came out in September 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P87_S0	There are no requirements for Units 3 4, but Units 1 2 will need upgrading pollution controls to meet new sulfure dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P88_S0	Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP on November 15, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P88_S1	PPL filed an appeal on behalf of the plant on November 16, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P88_S2	PSE cannot yet determine the outcome of this litigation.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P89_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking for the Identification and Listing of Special Wastes: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) from Electric Utilities which proposes different regulatory mechanisms to regulate coal ash.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P89_S1	The EPA received over 450,000 comments and over 2 million pages on the respective proposals in November 2010, including comments from PSE and other Colstrip owners.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P90_S0	EPA does not have a schedule for issuing a final CCR regulation.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S0	Under the first two options, coal ash could be regulated as a solid waste under Subtitle D provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S1	This would give authority to the states to oversee a set of performance standards for handling and disposal.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S2	Coal ash would be listed as non-hazardous and would allow wet handling to continue, and it would allow continued use of surface impoundments provided they are equipped with protective liners.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S3	One of these two options would require significantly less modifications to closed as well as in-use impoundments.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S4	Under the third option, coal ash could be regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C provisions of the RCRA, which would make coal ash subject to a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S5	Regulation under Subtitle C would essentially require the phase-out of wet handling and surface impoundments.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S6	The EPA estimates over 500 surface impoundments would be affected by this ruling.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S7	The impact to Colstrip operations and to PSE, could range from minimal to significant.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S8	Due to the wide range in the options proposed by the EPA, PSE cannot determine the potential impacts with any more certainty at this time.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P91_S9	We are involved with monitoring development of the final rule and are advocating for a reasonable approach that would be both protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S0	PCBs On April 7, 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of PCB-containing equipment.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S1	The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S2	This would likely remove all existing use authorizations for PCBs in electrical and gas pipeline equipment.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S3	As proposed, the ANPRM would mandate a phase out of in-service PCBs through a phased process with full removal achieved by 2025.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S4	The end of the comment period for the ANPRM was initially July 6, 2010 but due to the volume of comments received, EPA has rescheduled the issuance to April 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P92_S5	At this time, PSE cannot determine what the impacts of this NPRM will have on its operations but will continue to work closely with USWAG and AGA to monitor developments and advocate for a reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P93_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 4, 2013 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P94_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P95_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 4, 2013 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_13_ITEM1_P96_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic test year costs plus normalized assumptions about rate year power costs, weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Non-energy costs for natural gas retail customers are based on historic test year costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the Washington Commission decides what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P4_S5	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P6_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	PSE may be unable to acquire energy supply resources to meet projected customer needs or may fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	PSE projects that future energy needs will exceed current purchased and Company owned and controlled power resources in the near future.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As part of PSE s business strategy, it plans to acquire additional electric generation and delivery infrastructure to meet customer needs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S3	If PSE cannot acquire additional energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could significantly increase its expenses thus reducing earnings and cash flows.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Additionally, PSE may not be able to timely recover some or all of those increased expenses through ratemaking.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	While PSE expects to identify the benefits of new energy supply resources prior to their acquisition and integration, it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such energy supply sources.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, increased customer demand for energy, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Factors which could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its load requirements and/or high volumes of energy purchased in wholesale markets at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods or acts of nature.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	If PSE is unable to protect our information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	PSE operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite our implementation of security measures, our technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, these cyber-based attacks could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets as well as to supply and price risks affecting PSE s construction and maintenance programs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In connection with matching loads and resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P18_S6	Further, as a consequence of its electric generation construction and reconstruction programs and investments in its electric and gas distribution systems, PSE contracts to purchase substantial quantities of steel, cable, and similar materials, and thus is subject to supply and price risks affecting these items.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	To lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PSE may use forward delivery agreements, swaps and option contracts to hedge commodity price risk with a diverse group of counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	the coverage will vary over time.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To the extent PSE has unhedged positions or its hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could adversely impact its results of operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental, including air and climate protection, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, waste handling and disposal, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To comply with these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	With respect to endangered species laws, the listing or proposed listing of several species of salmon in the Pacific Northwest is causing a number of changes to the operations of hydroelectric generating facilities on Pacific Northwest rivers, including the Columbia River.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These changes could reduce the amount, and increase the cost, of power generated by hydroelectric plants owned by PSE, or in which PSE has an interest, and increase the cost of the permitting process for these facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or the new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington state has adopted both a renewable portfolio standard and greenhouse gas legislation, including an emission performance standard provision.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	PSE cannot yet determine the costs of compliance with the recently enacted legislation.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	While PSE cannot yet determine costs associated with these or future decisions or potential future legislation, there may be a significant impact on the cost of carbon-intensive coal generation, in particular.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE s operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE s business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, demand depends heavily on weather patterns in PSE s service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenue is recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S3	However, conservation efforts may result in decreased customer demand, despite normal or lower than normal temperatures.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Demand for electricity is also greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S5	Accordingly, PSE s operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P27_S6	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond and repair the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PSE may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S1	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, continued adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2013 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in general rate cases could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by its inability to successfully implement certain technology projects.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	PSE is currently undertaking a multi-year company-wide business process modernization effort which will replace existing software PSE currently uses for processing customer records and billing, mapping infrastructure assets and handling outage management tasks.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S1	These projects, are expected to be fully deployed by 2013, include: (1) a new Customer Information System intended to replace a PSE application that manages customer information and tracks outages and (2) an Outage Management System expected to augment and improve PSE s ability to pinpoint the sources of electric system outages and respond to them more quickly, focus repair efforts and more accurately predict restoration times.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Implementation of these information systems is complex, expensive and time consuming.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P35_S3	If PSE does not successfully implement the new systems and new processes, or if the systems do not operate as intended, it could result in substantial disruptions to PSE s business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Potential municipalization or technological developments may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	When a town or city establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires our assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that we provide.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	This loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	In addition, there is also the risk that advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P38_S3	This reduction in usage and demand would reduce PSE's revenue and negatively impact our financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P39_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, of which $434.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	PSE has access to three unsecured credit facilities that provide, in the aggregate $1.15 billion in short-term borrowing capability.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	PSE refinanced its credit facilities in February 2013 to two facilities with $1.0 billion in short-term borrowing capability, a 5 year contract, lower commitment fee rate and less restrictive covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In conjunction with the new PSE agreement, the Puget Energy agreement was reduced to a total of $800 million.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.4 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2012 had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	limit the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital and the ability to hedge in wholesale markets.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P44_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P46_S3	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these taxes.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P46_S4	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Potential legislation and regulatory actions could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank law gave regulators including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission the authority to create new oversight structures for derivative financial instruments, which were widely thought to have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The new legislation of certain over-the-counter swaps could expand collateral requirements of swaps, which may make it more costly for companies and/or limit the Company s ability to enter into such transactions.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The Dodd-Frank amended section 2(h)(7) of the Commodities Exchange Act to provide an elective exemption from the clearing requirements of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for any entity that is not a financial entity, is using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and notifies the CFTC, in a manner set forth by the CFTC, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	The Company is evaluating the legislation and the CFTC s implementation of it to determine its impact, if any, on the Company s hedging program, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P49_S2	The Company will not know the full impact of the new legislation until the regulations are finalized.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P50_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.0% at December 31, 2012 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.5 to 1.0 for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Gas Supply.
1085392_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of legal proceedings that are material to PSE s operations: Residential Exchange.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S1	The program is administered by the the BPA.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S3	In 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S4	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 period and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S5	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement that by its terms if upheld in its entirety would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for fiscal years 2002-2011 and determine REP benefits for fiscal years 2012-2028.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S6	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into this most recent settlement agreement.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S7	Oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit on this litigation occurred on February 19, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S8	Pending disposition of this challenge, the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits has been stayed by the Ninth Circuit.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S9	Due to the pending and ongoing proceedings, PSE is unable to reasonably estimate any amounts of REP payments either to be recovered by the BPA or to be paid for any future periods to PSE, and is unable to determine the impact, if any, these proceedings and litigation may have on PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P1_S10	However, the Company believes it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through to PSE's residential and small farm customers.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P2_S0	PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P3_S0	On July 25, 2012, Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) issued a Notice of Intent to Sue for violations of the Clean Air Act at Colstrip Steam Electric Station.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P3_S1	The notice, which was amended on August 30, 2012, September 27, 2012, and December 1, 2012, was addressed to the owner or managing agent of Colstrip and to the other Colstrip co-owners, including PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P3_S2	The notices allege violations of the Clean Air Act and state that the Sierra Club and MEIC will request a United States District Court to impose injunctive relief and civil penalties, require a beneficial environmental project in the areas affected by the alleged air pollution and require reimbursement of Sierra Club's and MEIC's costs of litigation and attorney's fees.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P3_S3	Under the Clean Air Act, lawsuits cannot be filed until 60 days after the applicable notice date.
1085392_13_ITEM3_P3_S4	PSE is evaluating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings, and are not publicly traded.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P0_S2	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P0_S3	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P0_S4	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	From time to time, when deemed advisable and permitted, each of PSE and Puget Energy pay dividends on its common stock.
1085392_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2012, 2011 and 2010, each of PSE paid dividends to its parent, Puget Energy, and Puget Energy paid dividends to its parent, Puget Equico, in the amounts shown in Puget Energy's and PSE's Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity included in this report.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	OVERVIEW Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P3_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE s basis of accounting continues to be on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P3_S4	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	To meet customer growth, to replace expiring power contracts and to meet Washington state s renewable energy portfolio standards, PSE is increasing energy efficiency programs to reduce the demand for additional energy generation and is pursuing additional renewable energy production resources (primarily wind) and base load natural gas-fired generation.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Company's strategy is to be a safe, dependable, and efficient utility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company has made a commitment to seek to be world-class in safety for employees, customers and communities; provide exceptional customer service; invest in technology to enhance customer service; commit to the professional development of the workforce; work with stakeholders to ensure timely and consistent regulatory support; and drive necessary changes to maintain the financial strength of the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	These investments and commitments related to utility infrastructure and customer service may give rise to expenditures, which may not be recovered timely through the ratemaking process.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	Additionally, Washington state law requires PSE to pursue conservation initiatives that promote efficient use of energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	This mandate negatively impacts financial performance due to the lost sales margins arising from reduced energy sales.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P5_S7	To mitigate the regulatory lag and costs associated with conservation initiatives, the Company is focused on the following initiatives:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	Develop an Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) process that would reduce the time to recover costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	Establish a decoupling mechanism to allow recovery of lost margins from conservation initiatives.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	Design a pipeline integrity program that would accelerate and enhance the safety of the gas system and ultimately reduce costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	Additionally, the Company has initiatives to reduce spending over the next five years to maintain its financial strength.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P8_S2	The initiatives include re-engineering the customer value chain process as well as evaluating and improving processes in all areas of the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the prior year, PSE s net income was positively affected by the following two factors: (1) an unrealized gain in derivatives instruments for energy contracts compared to an unrealized loss for the same periods in the prior year; and (2) increased electric margins driven by lower power costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	Further detail on each of these primary drivers, as well as other factors affecting performance, is set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion Analysis.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized loss on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The presentation of return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments is intended to supplement readers understanding of the Company s operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	Return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instrument is used by the Company to determine whether the Company is collecting the appropriate earnings from its customers to allow recovery of investor s capital.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	PSE's return on equity may not be comparable to other companies return on equity measures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace return on equity (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company has faced certain challenges which caused a significant reduction in the return on equity as compared to other years.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The following table presents PSE s return on equity for 2012 and 2011:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), subsidiary retained earnings and retained earnings of derivative instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s 2012 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 7.7%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity due to the following:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P16_S0	Operating revenue was $124.2 million lower than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P16_S1	However, margins increased $27.6 million due to significantly lower power costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P17_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $18.7 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and customer service expense.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P18_S0	Depreciation expense was $38.2 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric expenditures placed into service.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	Utility rate making process has a delay between incurring expenses and their recovery in rate base.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	PSE increased ratebase by $416.7 million since its last general rate increase effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	The Company s 2011 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 6.9%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity due to the following:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P22_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $21 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and gas operations costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P23_S0	Depreciation expense was $30 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P23_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric and common utility capital expenditures placed into service.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P24_S0	Utility rate making process has a delay between incurring expenses and their recovery in ratebase.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P24_S1	PSE increased ratebase by $484 million since its last general rate increase effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P25_S0	These negative impacts were offset by favorable load which increased natural gas therm sales 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to cooler temperatures in 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P25_S1	Also, favorable electric power costs had a positive impact on net income.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P26_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P27_S0	PSE s regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2012 and future years.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P27_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P27_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales, as well as by its customers conservation investments, which also tend to reduce energy sales.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P27_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Washington Commission requires these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S4	cost growth, thus rate increases are required.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S5	If, in a particular year, PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S6	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether expenses and investments are reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P28_S7	If the Washington Commission determines that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard applied, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P29_S0	Electric Rates PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P30_S0	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P30_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P31_S0	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P32_S0	PSE had a favorable PCA imbalance for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which was $27.4 million below the power cost baseline level, $3.7 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P32_S1	This compares to a favorable imbalance of $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 , $9.0 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P33_S0	On February 2, 2013, PSE filed an expedited rate filing in which it requested to increase electric rates by $31.9 million or 1.6% for electric customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P33_S1	PSE made this filing consistent with the expedited filing methodology proposed by Commission Staff and commented on favorably by the Commission in PSE's 2011 general rate case.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P33_S2	PSE requested that the tariffs for the expedited rate filing become effective April 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P34_S0	On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the BPA associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE's approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P35_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how REC proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P35_S1	The order required REC proceeds net of applicable costs to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P35_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P35_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2010 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company's RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P36_S0	The Company's California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P36_S1	The Washington Commission ordered that parties provide recommended methods for passing back the remaining deferred proceeds.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P36_S2	The Commission approved a joint proposal that allowed a portion of the REC proceeds received by PSE to offset the Production Tax Credits (PTCs) that had been passed through to customers but have not been used by PSE on its tax return, and after completion of the PTC offset, the Commission allowed PSE to offset the REC liability against rate base and amortize the balance of RECs at the beginning of a given rate year over five years as a credit to cost of service.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's electric general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S1	The rate increases for electric customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S3	PSE's requested treatment of the prepayments made to BPA, filed in May 2010, was approved in the order.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S4	The final order rejected PSE's proposed conservation savings adjustment.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S5	Finally, a new rate rider for RECs was proposed by settlement of Electric parties and approved by the Washington Commission in the final order.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P37_S6	The new rate rider replaced prospectively what was required pursuant to the Commission's orders in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P38_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million, effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P38_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P38_S2	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P39_S0	Natural Gas Rates PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P39_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P39_S2	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S0	On February 2, 2013, PSE filed an expedited rate filing in which it requested to decrease natural gas rates by $1.2 million or 0.1% for natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S1	PSE made this filing consistent with the expedited filing methodology proposed by Commission Staff and commented on favorably by the Commission in PSE's 2011 general rate case.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S2	PSE requested that the tariffs for the expedited rate filing become effective April 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S3	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission suspended PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and instituted an investigation, but allowed the requested rate decrease under the PGA to go into effect on a temporary basis effective November 1, 2012, subject to revision.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S4	Commission Staff is required to report back to the Commission on the status of Staff's investigation no later than March 1, 2013, and that report shall include recommendations on the disposition of the tariff PSE filed or the need for further process to make the appropriate determination.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S5	The estimated revenue impact of the change is a decrease of $77.0 million, or 7.7% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S6	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE's net income On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for natural gas customers of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S7	The rate increases for natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P40_S8	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P41_S0	On March 14, 2011, the Washington Commission issued its order authorizing PSE to increase its natural gas general tariff rates by $19.0 million or 1.8% on an annual basis effective April 1, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P41_S1	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE's natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually or $10.1 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P41_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P41_S3	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P42_S0	Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have a significant impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P42_S1	PSE's operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P42_S2	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P42_S3	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P42_S4	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P43_S0	PSE reported lower customer usage in the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to Pacific Northwest temperatures being warmer as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P43_S1	The actual average temperature during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 was 52.0 degrees, or 1.3 degrees warmer than the same period in the prior year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P43_S2	Although the average temperature during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 was warmer than the same period in the prior year, the average temperature was 0.7 degrees cooler when compared to the historical average.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P44_S0	PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above electric customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P44_S1	PSE also expects energy usage by both residential electric and natural gas customers to continue a long-term trend of slow decline primarily due to continued energy efficiency improvements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P45_S0	PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P45_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P45_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P45_S3	For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P45_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P46_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P46_S1	PSE's credit facilities expire in 2018 and Puget Energy's senior secured credit facility expires in 2017.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P46_S2	(See discussion on credit facilities in the section entitled Financing Program - Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper ).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P47_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P47_S1	Such regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P47_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality (including climate change) and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation byproducts such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company s operations.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P47_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts fulfilling requirements by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates, and on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees in order to comply with these regulatory requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P48_S0	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change and generation byproducts could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P49_S0	Other Challenges and Strategies Energy Supply.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P49_S1	As noted in PSE s IRP filed with the Washington Commission, PSE projects future energy needs will begin to exceed current resources by 2015 from long-term power purchase agreements and Company-controlled power resources.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P50_S0	The IRP identifies reductions in contractual supplies of energy and capacity available under certain long-term power purchase agreements, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P50_S1	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P51_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, significantly increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P52_S0	PSE is investing in its utility infrastructure and customer service functions in order to meet regulatory requirements, serve customers energy needs and replace aging infrastructure.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P52_S1	These investments and operating requirements give rise to significant growth in depreciation, amortization and operating expenses, which are not recovered through the ratemaking process in a timely manner.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P52_S2	This regulatory lag is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P53_S0	Operational Risks Associated With Generating Facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P54_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered, solar and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P55_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels, including facility shutdowns due to equipment and process failures or fuel supply interruptions.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P55_S1	PSE does not have business interruption insurance coverage to cover replacement power costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P56_S0	Energy Efficiency Related Lost Sales Margin.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P57_S0	PSE s sales, margins, earnings and cash flow are adversely affected by its energy efficiency programs, many of which are mandated by law.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P57_S1	The Company is evaluating strategies and other means to reduce or eliminate these adverse financial effects.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P57_S2	The Company is actively engaged in monitoring the development of the commercial markets for such intangible power attributes as RECs and carbon financial instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P57_S3	The Company supports the development of regional and national markets for these products that are open, transparent and liquid.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P58_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P58_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P60_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P61_S0	The presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P62_S0	Electric margin and gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P62_S1	PSE s electric margin and gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and gas margin measures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P62_S2	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2011 to 2012 and periods 2010 to 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P64_S0	Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P65_S0	______________ As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P66_S0	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P66_S1	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P67_S0	Electric margin increased $127.6 million and $106.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P67_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact electric operating revenue and electric energy costs which are included in electric margin:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P68_S0	2012 compared to 2011 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues decreased $19.0 million , or 0.9% , to $2,128.2 million from $2,147.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P68_S1	Operating revenue decreased $19.0 million primarily due to lower electric retail sales of $23.5 million and lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $22.0 million offset by higher miscellaneous other operating revenue of $27.0 million .

1085392_13_ITEM7_P98_S3	The increase was due to an approved accounting petition authorizing PSE to recover costs associated with the Company's current 2012 gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery commodity costs in the Company's PGA commodity account.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	Conservation amortization is a pass-through tariff item with no impact on earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Taxes other than income taxes decreased $4.1 million , or 1.3% , for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue sensitive taxes due to a decrease in retail sales and partially offset by an increase in property taxes.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	Other Income, Interest Expense and Income Tax Expense Other income decreased $9.0 million , or 15.5% , for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was primarily due to decreases of $10.2 million in AFUDC equity income, $15.9 million in regulatory interest, and $3.0 million of miscellaneous items.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Partially offsetting the decrease for the year ended December 31, 2012 is an increase due to the carrying costs associated with the Lower Snake River wind generating facility accruing interest income of $20.3 million, as authorized by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	Other Expense increased $6.4 million , or 118.8% , for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	The increase was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase related to customer credits resulting from the outages due to the January 2012 winter storm and $2.5 million related to civic affiliated activities.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	2011 compared to 2010 Other Operating Expenses Net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments decreased by $112.8 million to a loss of $54.1 million in 2011 as compared to a loss of $166.9 million during the same period in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	In 2011, the derivative portfolio experienced a significant number of 2010 contracts settling.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	As those contracts settled, the previous losses recorded in 2010 were reversed resulting in reduced losses between years.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	On July 1, 2009, PSE elected to de-designate its energy related derivative contracts previously designated as cash flow hedges.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P104_S1	The de-designated contracts were physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P104_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market accounting impacts are recognized through earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P104_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings when the contracts settle or sooner, if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P104_S4	As a result, PSE will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Over the tenor of PSE s outstanding derivative contracts, the forward wholesale prices of electricity and natural gas declined 25.7% and 23.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S2	The increase was driven by increases of $11.9 million increase in electric production, $6.2 in administration and general expenses and $1.5 million in gas operations costs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S3	Partially offsetting the increase is a $7.3 million decrease in electric transmission and distribution and a $1.7 million decrease in customer service expenses.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S4	Depreciation expense increased $7.0 million, or 2.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S5	The increase was primarily due to additional electrical and common utility capital expenditures placed into service, net of retirements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P105_S6	Conservation amortization increased $17.5 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The increase is primarily due to income related to the equity component of AFUDC.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S2	AFUDC increased $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, reflecting an increase in the average construction work in progress balance in 2011 due primarily to construction of wind and hydroelectric generation construction projects.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S3	This increase was partially offset by decreases in regulatory interest of $5.4 million, PTC of $1.2 million and conservative incentive of $1.2 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S4	Interest expense decreased $19.4 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S5	Contributing to the decrease was a increase of $15.8 million in the debt component of Allowance For Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) for the year ended December 31, 2011 which was included as construction expenditures and which was due to an increase in the average construction work in progress balance in 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S6	Also contributing to the decrease is $3.2 million due to lower interest expense on the REC liability owed to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P108_S7	Income tax expense increased $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P112_S4	The decrease was primarily due to a gain of $10.4 million related to the mark-to-market on the outstanding interest rate swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P112_S5	Additionally, in February and May, 2012 the outstanding interest rate swap balances were reduced by $277.4 million and $550 million, respectively; resulting in a decrease of $13.9 million in interest expense.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Interest expense increased $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as compared to the same period in 2011 .

1085392_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding AFUDC, are as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P130_S1	PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that exceeds its cash flow from operations.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P130_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	Puget Sound Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $0.5 million from $903.4 million generated during the same period in 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	The increase in cash flow was primarily the result of an increase in net income of $152.1 million and the following increases:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	Cash collections from revenues increased by $41.5 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	Payments made in 2011 relating to transmission prepayments for the Lower Snake River wind generation facility and the purchase of combustion turbine inventory that did not occur in 2012, which caused an increase in cash flow of approximately $27.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2012 described above was primarily offset by the following cash decreases:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	In 2012 , there was approximately $66.8 million of cash outflow for costs incurred related to the January winter storm of which $60.4 million was deferred for future recovery.

1085392_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	In addition, non cash items decreased approximately $173.3 million related to the fair value adjustment of derivative instruments; this was partially offset by an increase in items such as depreciation, amortization, and deferred income taxes and credits of approximately $96.2 million .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	Puget Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $ 888.7 million , a decrease of $ 121.6 million from the $1.0 billion generated during the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	The net decrease included a $ 0.5 million increase from the cash provided by the operating activities of PSE as previously discussed.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P138_S3	The factors contributing to the decrease included the following:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	As a result of the merger with Puget Holdings in February 2009, $ 92.7 million in derivative settlement payments were reclassified to financing activities for the year-to-date ended December 31, 2012 as compared to $ 182.7 million during the same period in 2011 , resulting in a decrease in operating cash flows of $ 90.0 million .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	This decrease was due to a decline in the number of contracts settled during 2012 as compared to the prior period.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	These contracts represent proceeds received from derivative instruments that included financing elements at the merger date.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	Financing Program The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P140_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , PSE had $181.0 million and $25.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S4	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2012 and 2011 was 6.49% , and 4.39% , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P141_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	At December 31, 2012 , PSE maintained three committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that provided, in the aggregate, $1.15 billion in short-term borrowing capability and which were due to mature concurrently in February 2014.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	These facilities included a $400.0 million credit agreement for working capital needs, a $400.0 million credit facility for funding capital expenditures and a $350.0 million facility to support energy hedging activities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S2	The credit agreements allowed PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that was based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S3	The working capital facility, as amended, included a swing line feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $50.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S4	The $400.0 million working capital facility and $350.0 million credit agreement to support energy hedging allowed for issuing standby letters of credit.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P142_S5	PSE paid a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the spread to the LIBOR was 0.85% and the commitment fee was 0.26%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P143_S1	The $400.0 million working capital facility also serves as a backstop for PSE's commercial paper program.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , PSE maintained its investment grade ratings and was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , no amounts were drawn and outstanding under PSE's $400.0 million working capital facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S2	Two letters of credit totaling $9.6 million in support of contracts were outstanding under the facility, and $181.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S3	The $400.0 million capital expenditure facility had no amounts drawn and outstanding.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S4	No amounts were drawn or outstanding (including letters of credit) under PSE's $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P144_S5	Outside of the unsecured revolving credit agreements, PSE had a $4.9 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE entered into two new unsecured revolving credit facilities and terminated its previous three credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	The new credit facilities provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S3	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S4	The new credit facilities also have an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.5 billion.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S5	The credit agreements for these two replacement credit facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous lenders and mature in February 2018.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S6	The credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S7	The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S8	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S9	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S10	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S11	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P145_S12	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.50% and the commitment fee is 0.225%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P146_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P146_S3	At December 31, 2012 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $29.6 million .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P146_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	At the time of the merger in February 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five-year term-loan and a $1.0 billion five-year capital expenditure credit facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P147_S1	On February 10, 2012, Puget Energy entered into a $1.0 billion five-year revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P147_S2	As a revolving facility, amounts borrowed may be repaid without a reduction in the size of the facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P147_S3	Initial borrowings under this facility were used to repay debt outstanding under the term loan and capital expenditure credit facility and those agreements were terminated.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	The five-year revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	The agreement also contains two financial covenants based on the following ratios: Group Funds From Operations (FFO) Coverage Ratio and Maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	The senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	Interest rates may be based on the prime rate or LIBOR, plus a spread based on Puget Energy s credit ratings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	At December 31, 2012 , $434.0 million was drawn and outstanding under the facility, the spread over LIBOR was 2.0% and the commitment fee was 0.375%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility (see Note 9 and the "Interest Rate Risk" sections).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	Concurrent with the closing of the new PSE credit facilities in February 2013, the Company reduced the size of Puget Energy's credit facility from $1.0 billion to $800.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P151_S2	The Puget Energy revolving credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P151_S3	All other terms and conditions of that facility remain unchanged from when it was committed in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	At December 31, 2012 , approximately $551.7 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.0% at December 31, 2012 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.5 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S6	At December 31, 2012 , the EBITDA to interest expense was 2.7 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P153_S7	At December 31, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	Debt Restrictive Covenants The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE are limited by provisions in PSE's credit agreements and mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	Under its credit agreements, PSE s long-term debt issuances cannot exceed $500.0 million per year, plus any amount needed to refinance maturing bonds.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	Unused amounts under this limitation may be carried forward into future years.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P154_S3	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P154_S4	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2012 , PSE could issue:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	Approximately $271.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $451.7 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	At December 31, 2012 , PSE had approximately $6.5 billion in electric and natural gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	Upon approval of the merger in 2009, the Company was required to refinance its debt in place at the time of the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	The Company has met this refinancing requirement as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	Shelf Registrations and Long-Term Debt Activity Puget Sound Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	On June 15, 2012, Puget Energy issued $450.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P159_S1	The notes are secured by substantially all of Puget Energy's assets, which consist primarily of the equity interests it holds in PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P159_S2	The notes mature on July 15, 2022 and have an interest rate of 5.625%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P159_S3	Net proceeds from the note offering were used by Puget Energy to pay down $425.0 million of the $859.0 million balance outstanding on a five-year $1.0 billion revolving senior secured credit facility put in place in February 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	And Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P160_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P162_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P165_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012 in the amount of $936.2 million and $628.9 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2011 of $845.5 million and $390.0 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P165_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P166_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Electric Regulation and Rates within Item 1.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	Business Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customers' bills through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P170_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P176_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P176_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P176_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P178_S2	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $4.0 billion at the October 1, 2012 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P178_S3	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.4 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 17.5% or $598.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $4.1 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 7.0%, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P179_S2	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P180_S2	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the NPNS exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P181_S1	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P182_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P184_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P184_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P184_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P184_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P187_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P188_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P188_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P189_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P189_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P189_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $14.8 million , $6.6 million and $8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 57.2%, 61.0% and 61.1% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P191_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $9.3 million and pension income of $1.9 million, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P191_S4	In 2013 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $21.3 million and $16.6 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $5.0 million, $5.2 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P192_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P192_S3	In 2013 , it is expected PSE and Puget Energy will recognize $5.7 million of pension expense and $0.8 million of pension income, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	PSE has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S1	PSE recognized expense of $0.3 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S3	In 2013 , it is expected that PSE will recognize expense of $0.3 million and $0.2 million incremental expense for Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S4	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P193_S5	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P194_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P194_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P194_S4	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	During 2012 , the Company made a cash contribution of $22.8 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company s qualified pension plan was $85.1 million and $86.2 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 86.2% and 84.8% funded respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P195_S3	As of January 1, 2013, the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P195_S4	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2013 are expected to be at least $20.4 million , $5.0 million and $0.8 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.75% in 2011 to 4.15% in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P196_S1	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 5.15% in 2011 to 4.75% in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P196_S2	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2012 remained unchanged at 2011 level, or 7.75% .
1085392_13_ITEM7_P196_S3	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits decreased from 7.80% in 2011 to 7.50% in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE is focused on the commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios and related effects noted above.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The objectives of the hedging strategy are to:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Meet the credit, liquidity, financing, tax and accounting requirements of PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	ASC 815 requires a significant amount of disclosure regarding PSE s derivative activities and the nature of their impact on PSE s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The information in this Item 7A should serve as an accompaniment to Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	customers to commodity price risks through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	All purchased natural gas costs are recovered through customer rates with no direct impact on PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and related hedging strategies are focused on balancing PSE s energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electricity and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, and floating-for-fixed swap contracts that are related to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The forward physical electricity contracts are both fixed and variable (at index) while the physical natural gas contracts are variable with investment grade counterparties that do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into floating-for-fixed (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S4	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affected earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P7_S5	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments that do not meet the NPNS exception :
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings and OCI (for cash flow hedges), see Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company had total assets of $12.1 million and total liabilities of $108.1 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of natural gas to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	All fair value adjustments of derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980, "Regulated Operations", due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S4	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $43.2 million, with an after-tax impact of $28.2 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P10_S5	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2012 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2012, based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P14_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P14_S4	As of December 31, 2012, PSE held approximately $0.2 million worth of standby letters of credit in support of various electricity and REC transactions.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S2	As of December 31, 2012, approximately 91.8% of PSE s energy and natural gas portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies while 8.2% are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S3	PSE assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S4	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S5	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements - to standardized power sales contracts in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements - to standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements - to standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P15_S6	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the risk of default by allowing a counterparty the ability to make only one net payment.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P16_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Counterparty credit risk impacts PSE s decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P16_S2	A counterparty may have a deterioration of credit below investment grade, potentially indicating that it is no longer probable that it will fulfill its obligations under a contract (e.g., make a physical delivery upon the contract's maturity).
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P17_S0	ASC 815 specifies the requirements for derivative contracts to qualify for the NPNS scope exception.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P18_S0	When performance is no longer probable, PSE records the fair value of the contract on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded in the statements of income.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Accumulated OCI of the cash flow hedge is also impacted by a counterparty s deterioration of credit under ASC 815 guidelines.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P19_S1	If a forecasted transaction associated with the cash flow hedge probable of not occurring, PSE will reclassify the amounts deferred in accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P20_S1	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P21_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P22_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e. WSPP, ISDA or NAESB).
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P22_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P22_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P23_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P23_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P24_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P24_S1	For those in a net liability position, the Company calculates the credit reserve by using its own bond spreads.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P25_S0	The fair value of derivative instruments includes the impact of credit reserves.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P25_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P25_S2	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P25_S3	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S4	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P26_S5	As of December 31, 2012, Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S0	In February 2009, Puget Energy entered into a cash flow hedge using interest rate swaps to hedge risk associated with one-month LIBOR floating rate debt.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S1	Subsequently, in order to satisfy a commitment the Company made to the Washington Commission and to mitigate interest rate risk, the Company refinanced a portion of the underlying debt hedged by the interest rate swaps in 2010, 2011, and again during 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S2	In order to better align its existing swap notional with the reduced underlying debt balance, in 2012, the Company has net settled $827.4 million of the interest rate swaps, thereby reducing the swap notional to $450.0 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S3	Additionally, the Company amended the remaining two interest rate swap agreements to extend the maturities to January 2017 .
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S4	As a result of refinancing in 2010, the Company de-designated the cash flow hedge accounting relationship between the debt and interest rate swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S5	A portion of the outstanding interest rate swap derivative loss associated with the probable future interest payments occurring remains in OCI, and is amortized monthly as the payments occur.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S6	The portion of the outstanding interest rate swap derivative loss associated with interest payments on the debt where future payments become remote of occurring is reclassified from OCI into earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S7	At December 31, 2012, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $21.5 million pre-tax loss.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S8	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S9	The ending balance in OCI includes a loss of $4.6 million pre-tax, and $3.0 million after tax, related to the interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedge.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S10	The OCI balance relates to the loss that was recorded when the cash flow hedge was de-designated in December 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S11	Currently, all changes in market value are recorded in earnings instead of OCI.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S12	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of Puget Energy's interest rate swaps by $1.1 million.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P27_S13	The following table presents the fair value of Puget Energy s interest rate swaps:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P28_S0	The change in fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps from December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2012 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P29_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2012, based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P30_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which may utilize broker quotes and internal pricing models.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P31_S0	Significant pricing inputs are based on observable market data.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P32_S0	From time to time PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P32_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2012 was a net loss of $6.6 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P32_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $6.9 million in OCI as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P33_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P33_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P34_S0	The following table presents the carrying value and the fair value of the Company s debt instruments :
1085392_13_ITEM7A_P35_S0	______________ Short-term debt owed by PSE to Puget Energy is eliminated upon consolidation of Puget Energy.

1085392_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	Basis of Presentation Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings), a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P32_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P32_S2	The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P32_S3	ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiary, PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiaries.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P33_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P35_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P35_S2	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Utility Plant Puget Energy and PSE capitalize, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P36_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an Allowance For Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P36_S2	Replacements of minor items of property and major maintenance are included in maintenance expense when the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	Non-Utility Property, Plant and Equipment For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P37_S2	Replacement of minor items are expensed on a current basis.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired are reflected in earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Depreciation and Amortization For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P39_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	The depreciation of automobiles, trucks, power-operated equipment, tools and office equipment is allocated to asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.9% , 2.7% and 2.7% in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively; depreciable gas utility plant was 3.4% , 3.5% and 3.6% in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively; and depreciable common utility plant was 11.6% , 11.3% and 11.8% in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P42_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P48_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P48_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P48_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2012 using an October 1, 2012 measurement date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P50_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P50_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P50_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P51_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P51_S2	Changes in these estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P51_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P51_S4	There were no events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2012 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	The cash and cash equivalents balance at Puget Energy was $135.5 million and $37.2 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P52_S2	The 2012 and 2011 balance consisted of cash equivalents, which are reported at cost and approximates fair value, and were $107.6 million and $16.8 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Fuel and Gas Inventory Fuel and gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	Gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it were probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P55_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term assets or liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	The exception is the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) which can be a current asset or current liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P57_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending principally upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	The authorized AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) for natural gas and electric utility plant additions based on the effective dates is as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P60_S3	The following table presents the AFUDC amounts:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P62_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P62_S3	Sales to other utilities are recognized in accordance with ASC 605 and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	Non-utility subsidiaries recognize revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P63_S2	Sales of RECs are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $244.2 million , $252.5 million and $231.1 million for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operating revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P65_S3	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $9.9 million and $8.5 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	Self-Insurance PSE currently has no insurance coverage for storm damage and recent environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	PSE is self-insured for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P67_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P68_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE provides natural gas to its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P69_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P69_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas for power are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	Prior to July 1, 2010, PSE passed the benefit of the PTCs to customers as the benefits were generated.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P70_S2	After July 1, 2010, PSE records the benefit of the PTCs as a regulatory liability until such time as PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P70_S3	Once utilized, PSE will pass the benefit to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P73_S2	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting in 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P73_S3	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P73_S4	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P76_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 Fair Value Measurements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	Statements of Cash Flows The Company has refinancing transactions that do not result in an actual exchange of cash.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	For these transactions, the Company evaluates if the non-exchange of cash is for convenience purposes and if so, the Company considers the transaction as if it had constructively received and disbursed the cash and presents the transaction as gross on the financing section of the statements of cash flows.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	PSE funds cash dividends to pay the shareholder of Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P80_S1	The following non-cash investing and financing activities have occurred at the Company:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	The following tables set forth the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Intangibles - Goodwill and Other .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S1	On January 1, 2012, Puget Energy adopted ASU 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment(ASU 2011-08).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S2	ASU 2011-08 allows an entity the option to qualitatively assess whether it must perform the two-step goodwill impairment test in FASB ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S3	An entity has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not (more than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S4	If an entity elects to perform the qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is in excess of its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P82_S5	Otherwise, an entity would perform Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test in ASC 350-20.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	ASU 2011-08 was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact on the financial reporting of Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASU 2012-02 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 and early adoption is permitted.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	ASU 2012-02 allows an entity the option to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not (more than 50% likelihood) that the asset is impaired.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	If an entity elects to perform the qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is in excess of its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	Otherwise, an entity would perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P86_S3	ASU 2012-02 will not be adopted early and will not have a material impact on the financial reporting of Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income (ASU 2011-05).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2011-05 allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of OCI either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of OCI along with a total for OCI, and a total amount for comprehensive income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S3	ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of OCI as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S4	The ASU also requires the presentation of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from OCI to net income on the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S5	However, the FASB has deferred this requirement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S6	The amendments to the ASC in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in OCI or when an item of OCI must be reclassified to net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S7	ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively, and was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S8	Prior to the effective date of the ASU, the Company had already complied with the presentation requirement, as the Company presents the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of OCI in two separate statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P87_S9	Therefore, ASU 2011-05 did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	On January 1, 2012, the Company adopted ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (ASU 2011-04).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	ASU 2011-04 represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board on fair value measurement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Many of the amendments to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), eliminate unnecessary wording differences between IFRS and GAAP.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	ASU 2011-04 expands ASC 820 s existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 by requiring (1) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement, (2) a description of the valuation processes in place, and (3) a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those inputs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P89_S2	In addition, ASU 2011-04 requires the Company to indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not recorded at fair value but whose fair value must be disclosed.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	Other amendments to ASC 820 include clarifying the highest and best use and valuation premise for nonfinancial assets, net risk position fair value measurement option for financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market risks or counterparty credit risk, premiums and discounts in fair value measurement, and fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	ASU 2011-04 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	Adoption of ASU 2011-04 did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11- Balance Sheet (Topic 210) (ASU 2011-11).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	ASU 2011-11 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	ASU 2011-11, as amended by ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, enhances disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity's right to offset and related arrangements associated with its derivative instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S3	ASU 2011-11 requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S4	ASU 2011-11, as amended, is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S5	Retrospective application of the disclosures is required for all periods presented within the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P93_S6	These disclosure requirements are the only impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it were probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P94_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P94_S2	Below is a chart with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and the associated time periods:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012 and 2011 included the following:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Commission rate proceeding.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P96_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P96_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805 as a result of the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $239.2 million and $219.1 million in 2012 and 2011 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P98_S3	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Washington Commission issued a general rate case order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	PSE s storm accounting allows deferral of certain storm damage costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	In 2012 and 2011 , PSE incurred $71.5 million and $4.6 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $60.4 million was deferred in 2012 and no amount was deferred in 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	Electric General Rate Case On May 20, 2010, PSE filed an accounting petition requesting that the Washington Commission approve: (1) the creation of a regulatory asset account for the prepayments made to the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) associated with network upgrades to the Central Ferry substation related to the Lower Snake River wind project; (2) the monthly accrual of carrying charges on that regulatory asset at PSE s approved net of tax rate of return; and (3) the ability to provide customers the BPA interest received through a reduction to transmission expense.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's electric general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	The rate increases for electric customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S3	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S4	PSE's requested treatment of the prepayments made to BPA, filed in May 2010, was approved in the order.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S5	The final order rejected PSE's proposed conservation savings adjustment.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P101_S6	Finally, a new rate rider for Renewable Energy Credits ( RECs ) was proposed by settlement of Electric parties and approved by the Washington Commission in the final order.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE s consolidated electric rate case filed in May 2009 which approved a general rate increase for electric customers of 3.7% annually, or $74.1 million , effective April 8, 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	The following table sets forth electric rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), a limited-scope proceeding, was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P104_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P104_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six -month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11 -month timeline for a general rate case.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	Accounting Orders and Petitions On May 21, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that authorizes the deferral of a settlement payment of $10.7 million incurred as a result of the recent settlement of a lawsuit in the state of Montana over alleged damages caused by the operation of the Colstrip Montana coal-fired steam electric generation facility (Colstrip).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The payment was expensed pending resolution of the accounting petition.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P105_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission allowed recovery of $8.4 million in PSE s operating costs, which represents the amount of the settlement, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	On November 5, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing the deferral and recovery of interest due the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2001 to 2006 along with carrying costs incurred in connection with the interest due.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	In October 2005, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing the deferral and recovery of costs associated with increased borrowings necessary to remit deferred taxes to the IRS.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission denied recovery of the interest due to the IRS.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P107_S2	PSE expensed the interest deferral of $6.9 million in April 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	On November 6, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing accounting treatment and amortization related to payments received for taking assignment of Westcoast Pipeline Capacity.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	The accounting petition seeks deferred accounting treatment and amortization of the regulatory liability to power costs beginning in November 2009 and extending over the remaining primary term of the pipeline capacity contract through October 31, 2018.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P108_S2	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the deferral of $7.5 million and amortization as proposed.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	On April 17, 2009, the Washington Commission issued an order approving and adopting a settlement agreement that authorized PSE to defer certain ownership and operating costs related to its purchase of the Mint Farm Electric Generating Station (Mint Farm) that were incurred prior to PSE recovering such costs in electric customer rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	Under Washington state law, a jurisdictional electric utility may defer the costs associated with purchasing and operating a natural gas plant that complies with the GHG emissions performance standard until the plant is included in rates or for two years from the date of purchase, whichever occurs sooner.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission approved the prudence of the Mint Farm acquisition and recovery of the deferred costs from the plant s in-service date to the date of the order.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	The deferred costs are to be amortized over 15 years.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P110_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , the balance of the regulatory asset, net of amortization was $24.3 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	The Washington Commission issued an order in 2010 relating to how REC proceeds should be handled for regulatory accounting and ratemaking purposes.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	The order required REC proceeds to be recorded as regulatory liabilities and that amounts recorded would accrue interest at the Company s approved after-tax rate of return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	In its petition, PSE had sought approval for the use of $21.1 million of REC proceeds to be used as an offset against its California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P111_S3	In response to the order, PSE adjusted the carrying value of its regulatory asset in the second quarter of 2011 by $17.8 million (from $21.1 million to $3.3 million ), with the $3.3 million then offset against the Company s RECs regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	The Company s California wholesale energy sales regulatory asset represented unpaid bills for power sold into the markets maintained by the California Independent System Operator during the 2000-2001 California Energy Crisis, the claims of which were settled along with all counterclaims against PSE in a settlement agreement approved by the FERC on July 1, 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Washington Commission ordered that parties provide recommended methods for passing back the remaining deferred proceeds.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	Commission allowed PSE to offset the REC liability against rate base and amortize the balance of RECs at the beginning of a given rate year over five years as a credit to cost of service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	On May 7, 2012, a new rate rider for RECs was approved by the Commission in the final order in PSE's general rate case.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	The new rate rider replaced prospectively what was required pursuant to the Commission's orders in 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	On October 25, 2012 PSE filed a petition for an order authorizing PSE to implement electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms and to record accounting entries associated with the mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P114_S1	This is currently pending before the Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	Energy Credit PSE has a tariff which passes the benefits of the PTCs to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	The tariff is not subject to the sharing bands in the PCA.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	Prior to July 1, 2010, PSE would adjust the PTC tariff annually based on differences between the PTC benefits provided to the customers and the PTCs actually generated.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P116_S1	Since PSE was providing the benefit of the PTCs to customers prior to utilizing the PTCs on its tax returns, the Company would be reimbursed for its carrying costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Effective July 1, 2010, the Washington Commission approved a change in PSE s PTC tariff.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P117_S1	PSE had not been able to utilize PTCs on its tax return since 2007 due to insufficient taxable income caused primarily by bonus tax depreciation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P117_S2	The Washington Commission approved the suspension of the tariff, effective July 1, 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P117_S3	This resulted in an overall increase in PSE s electric rates of 1.7% ; however, this did not result in an increase in earnings as the benefit of PTCs pass-through to customers without impact to earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P117_S4	The tariff was renamed the Federal Incentive Tracker as it was also expanded to cover additional federal incentives.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	On September 22, 2010, a joint proposal and accounting petition was filed with the Washington Commission by PSE, Washington Commission Staff and Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities which addressed how to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addresses REC proceeds to be returned to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	On October 26, 2010, the Washington Commission issued an order allowing PSE to recover PTCs provided to customers that have not been utilized and addressing the pass back of REC proceeds to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S2	The order allows the Company to credit customers for REC revenue received and deferred through November 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S3	This credit was set to reduce rates by $27.7 million , or 2.9% , over five months beginning November 2010 through March 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S4	RECs received after November 2009 would be retained by PSE and would be used to recapture the benefit of PTCs previously provided to customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P118_S5	Finally, the order provides that PSE will pass-through to customers the benefit of the PTCs following the year in which they are utilized on PSE's tax return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	PCA Mechanism In 2002, the Washington Commission approved a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity varies from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	All significant variable power supply cost variables (hydroelectric and wind generation, market price for purchased power and surplus power, natural gas and coal fuel price, generation unit forced outage risk and transmission cost) are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a calendar year basis, between PSE and its customers on a graduated scale.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	The differences between the actual cost of PSE s natural gas supplies and natural gas transportation contracts and costs currently allowed by the Washington Commission are deferred and recovered or repaid through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P121_S1	The PGA mechanism allows PSE to recover expected natural gas and transportation costs, and defer, as a receivable or liability, any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in the PGA mechanism rates, including interest.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	Treasury Grant Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (Section 1603) authorizes the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) to make grants (Treasury Grants) to taxpayers who place specified energy property in service provided certain conditions are met.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P122_S1	Section 1603 precludes a recipient from claiming PTCs on property for which a grant is claimed.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	The Wild Horse wind project (Wild Horse) expansion facility was placed into service on November 9, 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	The capacity of the Wild Horse facility was expanded from 229 megawatts (MW) to 273 MW through the addition of wind turbines.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	In February 2010, the U.S. Treasury approved a Treasury Grant of $28.7 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	The 343 MW Lower Snake River facility was placed into service on February 29, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	In December 2012, the U.S. Treasury approved a Treasury Grant of $205.3 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	On December 30, 2010, the Washington Commission approved revisions to PSE s Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P125_S1	The rate schedule passed-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant in 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P125_S2	The order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the Treasury Grant on an annual basis and included 23 months of Treasury Grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represented the month the Treasury Grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P125_S3	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3% , with no impact to net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	On February 29, 2012, PSE filed proposed tariff revisions, with stated effective dates of April 1, 2012, and subsequently revised by filing on March 29, 2012 with stated effective dates of June 1, 2012, to pass-through $2.4 million in interest on the unamortized balance of the Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	On June 26, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's methods and calculations and new rates became effective on July 3, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	The rate change will pass through 11 months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over 11 months beginning February 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S4	Of the total credit, $34.6 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $23.8 million represents the pass through of interest.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P126_S5	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.76% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	Gas Regulation and Rates Gas General Rate Cases and Other Filings Affecting Rates On October 31, 2012 , the Washington Commission suspended PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing but allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	The rates resulted in a decrease to the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P127_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change if allowed on a permanent basis is a decrease of $77.0 million , or 7.7% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P127_S3	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE's net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	On October 25, 2012 PSE filed a petition for an order authorizing PSE to implement electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms and to record accounting entries associated with the mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	This is currently pending before the Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P129_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P129_S2	The Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P129_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of 6.6 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	On October 27, 2011, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing effective November 1, 2011, to decrease the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved charge is a decrease of $43.5 million , or 4.3% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE's net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	On June 13, 2011, PSE filed a general rate increase with the Washington Commission which proposed an increase in natural gas rates of $31.9 million or 3.0% , to be effective May 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P131_S1	PSE requested a weighted cost of capital of 8.42% , or 7.29% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.0% in common equity with a return on equity of 10.8% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P131_S2	The filing also proposes a conservation savings adjustment mechanism related to energy efficiency services for business and residential customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	On January 17, 2012, PSE filed rebuttal testimony which included a reduction to the requested natural gas rate increase to $28.6 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	The $3.3 million reduction was primarily due to a change to the weighted cost of capital to 8.26% , or 7.17% after-tax, which included a change to the return on equity to 10.75% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for natural gas customers of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P133_S1	The rate increases for natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P133_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	On April 26, 2011, PSE filed a new tariff for a Natural Gas Pipeline Integrity Program.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	This program is intended to enhance pipeline safety by providing for the timely recovery of the Company s cost to replace certain natural gas system infrastructure that would emphasize system reliability, integrity and safety which would increase natural gas revenue by $1.9 million or 0.2% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	In its final order the Washington Commission rejected PSE's tariff filing, but initiated an investigation to determine if more needs to be done for replacement requirements and cost recovery methods in order to decrease the risks associated with older plastic and other identified pipe.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	On November 28, 2012, the Washington Commission issued a Draft Statement of Commission Policy in the investigation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	Comments on the Draft Policy Statement were filed on December 7, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	PSE would provide bi-annual pipe replacement plans and would be allowed, beginning November 2013, expedited recovery of approved replacement costs made after October 2012 under the plans.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	On March 14, 2011, the Washington Commission issued its order authorizing PSE to increase its natural gas general tariff rates by $19.0 million or 1.8% on an annual basis effective April 1, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	On April 2, 2010, the Washington Commission issued its order, effective April 8, 2010, in PSE s natural gas general rate case filed in May 2009, approving a general rate increase of 0.8% annually or $10.1 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P137_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 8.1% and a capital structure that included 46.0% common equity with an after-tax return on equity of 10.1% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	On November 5, 2008, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order authorizing the deferral and recovery of interest due the IRS for tax years 2001 to 2006 along with carrying costs incurred in connection with the interest due.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	In October 2005, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing the deferral and recovery of costs associated with increased borrowings necessary to remit deferred taxes to the IRS.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P139_S1	In the April 2, 2010 general rate case order, the Washington Commission denied recovery of the interest due to the IRS.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P139_S2	PSE expensed the interest deferral of $6.9 million in April 2010.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	Purchased Gas Adjustment On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission suspended PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and instituted an investigation, but allowed the requested rate decrease under the PGA to go into effect on a temporary basis effective November 1, 2012, subject to revision.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P140_S1	Commission Staff is required to report back to the Commission on the status of Staff's investigation no later than March 1, 2013, and that report shall include recommendations on the disposition of the tariff PSE filed or the need for further process to make the appropriate determination.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P140_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the change is a decrease of $77.0 million , or 7.7% annually.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P140_S3	The rate adjustment has no impact on PSE's net income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P141_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P141_S3	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	During 1992, the Washington Commission issued orders regarding the treatment of costs incurred by the Company for certain sites under its environmental remediation program.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	The orders authorize the Company to accumulate and defer prudently incurred cleanup costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	Per the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and adjusts loss reserves quarterly.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	remediation costs ranging from $37.6 million to $55.9 million for gas and from $8.6 million to $27.2 million for electric.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	The Company does not consider any amounts within those ranges as being a better estimate and has therefore accrued $37.6 million and $8.6 million for gas and electric, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P147_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Company incurred deferred electric and natural gas environmental costs of $10.9 million and $66.4 million , net of insurance proceeds, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	At December 31, 2012 , approximately $551.7 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.0% at December 31, 2012 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.5 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default, or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters pri or to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S6	At December 31, 2012 , the EBITDA to interest expense was 2.7 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P149_S7	At December 31, 2012 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	In 2012, the Company acquired a power plant and related assets which resulted in an increase of approximately $90.0 million in assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P150_S1	PSE recorded the plant assets at original cost and accumulated depreciation with an acquisition adjustment in accordance with FERC rules.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P150_S2	On February 4, 2013, the Company signed an agreement that allows a sale of electric infrastructure and a transition of electrical service to Jefferson County Public Utility District.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P150_S3	The Company expects the sale to occur during the first half of 2013 for a price that exceeds the carrying value of the assets of $47.4 million as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	The following table indicates the Company s percentage ownership and the extent of the Company s investment in jointly owned generating plants in service at December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	These amounts are also included in the Utility Plant table above.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company recognized new AROs of $7.7 million and $0.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	The following table describes all changes to the Company s ARO liability:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which were not recognized at December 31, 2012 and 2011:

1085392_13_ITEM8_P178_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P178_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P178_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and related hedging strategies are focused on balancing PSE's energy portfolio, reducing costs and risks where feasible thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P179_S0	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P179_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into physical and financial transactions which are appropriate for the service territory of PSE and are relevant to its regulated electric and natural gas portfolios.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P180_S0	At the February 2009 merger date, Puget Energy recorded all derivative contracts at fair value as either assets or liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P180_S1	Certain contracts meeting the criteria defined in ASC 815 were subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P180_S2	As PSE had no change in accounting for these contracts at the time of the merger, this resulted in a difference in the accounting for certain contracts between Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P180_S3	The difference in the derivative unrealized gains/losses recorded through earnings between Puget Energy and PSE, caused by these contracts, will continue to occur through March 2015.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P181_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P181_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P182_S0	contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings, unless the amounts qualify and are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P182_S1	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P182_S2	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods through March 2015.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P183_S2	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P183_S3	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P183_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S0	In February 2009, Puget Energy entered into a cash flow hedge using interest rate swaps to hedge the risk associated with one-month LIBOR floating rate debt.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S1	Subsequently, in order to satisfy a commitment the Company made to the Washington Commission and to mitigate interest rate risk, the Company refinanced a portion of the underlying debt hedged by the interest rate swaps in 2010, 2011, and again during 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S2	In order to better align its existing swap notional with the reduced underlying debt balance, in 2012, the Company net settled $827.4 million of the interest rate swaps, thereby reducing the swap notional to $450.0 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S3	Additionally, the Company amended the remaining two interest rate swap agreements to extend the maturities to January 2017.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S4	As a result of refinancing in 2010, the Company de-designated the cash flow hedge accounting relationship between the debt and interest rate swaps.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S5	A portion of the outstanding interest rate swap derivative loss associated with the probable future interest payments occurring remains in OCI, and is amortized monthly as the payments occur.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S6	The portion of the outstanding interest rate swap derivative loss associated with interest payments on the debt where future payments become remote of occurring is reclassified from OCI into earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P184_S7	The following tables present the fair value and locations of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P185_S0	___________ Balance sheet location: Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P185_S1	Balance sheet location: Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	PSE had a net derivative liability and an offsetting regulatory asset of $ 96.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $200.9 million at December 31, 2011 related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P186_S1	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980) due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P186_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism and the gains and losses on the hedges in future periods will be recorded as gas costs.

1085392_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	The following tables present the pre-tax gain (loss) of the Company's derivatives that were in a previous cash flow hedge relationship, reclassified out of accumulated OCI into income:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was reported as a component of OCI, and then reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	There were no additional amounts deferred into OCI during 2012 or 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P191_S2	Puget Energy expects that $4.5 million of losses in accumulated OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.

1085392_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company had the following outstanding interest rate and commodity contracts as of December 31, 2012:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P197_S2	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial problems.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P197_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P197_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P198_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	and 0.1% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P199_S2	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreement - standardized power sales contract in the electric industry; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements - standardized financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements - standardized physical gas contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P199_S3	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments and, in the event of counterparty default, termination payments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P200_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA, or NAESB).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P200_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P200_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P200_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P201_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P201_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and coming up with an average value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P201_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P202_S1	For those in a net liability position, the Company calculates the credit reserve by using its own bond spreads.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P203_S0	The fair value of derivative instruments includes the impact of credit reserves.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P203_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the quarter.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P204_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P204_S1	Despite its net liability position, PSE was not required to post any additional collateral with any of its counterparties.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P204_S2	Additionally, PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P204_S3	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company did not have any outstanding energy supply contracts with counterparties that contained credit risk related contingent features, which could result in a counterparty requesting immediate payment or demanding immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P204_S4	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company's derivative activity at December 31, 2012 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P205_S0	__________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P205_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P206_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P206_S1	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in the forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P207_S0	GAAP established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P207_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P207_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P208_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P208_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P208_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P209_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P210_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P210_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P211_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P212_S1	Therefore, if a fair value measurement relies on significant inputs from different levels of the hierarchy, the entire measurement must be placed based on the lowest level.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P212_S2	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P213_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas market from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P214_S1	These forward price quotes are used in addition to other various inputs to determine the reported fair value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P214_S2	Some of the inputs, which are not significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests), assumptions for time value, and also the impact of the Company's non-performance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P214_S3	For interest rate swaps, the Company obtains monthly mark-to-market values from an independent external pricing service for LIBOR forward rates, which is a significant input.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P214_S4	Some of the inputs of the interest rate swap valuations, which are not significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties, assumptions for time value and the impact of the Company's non-performance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	Cash equivalents and restricted cash classified as Level 2 fair value instruments consist of special money market funds and premium checking accounts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Company valued Level 2 cash equivalents and restricted cash using the market approach based on the fair value of underlying investments at reporting date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Company considers its electric, natural gas and interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P216_S1	However, certain energy derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy since Level 3 inputs are significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	Management's assessment was based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g., Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	The following table presents the carrying value for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable and short-term debt by level, within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P219_S1	The carrying values below are representative of fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P220_S1	Carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P221_S1	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	_______________ Income Statement location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P222_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $(15.2) million , $(55.2) million , and $(89.4) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P222_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P223_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P223_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P224_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P224_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P225_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P225_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P225_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P226_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P226_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P226_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P227_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P227_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P227_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's purchased commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2012:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P228_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P229_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P229_S1	Consequently significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P230_S0	Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P230_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P231_S0	At December 31, 2012, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $17.8 million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P232_S0	At the time of merger, Puget Energy recorded the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P232_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P232_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P233_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P234_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P234_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P235_S0	At December 31, 2012 , Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test of its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P235_S1	The valuation indicated a fair value of $561.3 million with an impairment to one of the purchased power contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P235_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , the carrying value for the Rock Island intangible asset contract was $7.6 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be a liability of $10.2 million , thereby requiring a complete write-off of the intangible asset with a corresponding $7.6 million reduction to the regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P236_S0	The valuation was measured using the income approach.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P236_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract costs which provided future net cash flow estimates which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P236_S2	An insignificant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P236_S3	Below are the significant unobservable inputs used in the fourth quarter in estimating the fair value of the Rock Island long-term power purchase contract during the period ended December 31, 2012 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P237_S0	At March 31, 2012 , due to decreasing forward wholesale market prices, Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test for its purchase power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P237_S1	The valuation indicated impairment to one of the purchased power contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P237_S2	As of March 31, 2012 , the carrying value for the Wells Hydro intangible asset contract was $113.3 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be $96.7 million , thereby requiring a $16.6 million write-down of the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P238_S0	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in the first quarter in estimating the fair value of the Wells Hydro long-term power purchase contract during the period ended March 31, 2012 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P239_S0	At December 31, 2011 , Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test for its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P239_S1	The valuation indicated a fair value of $619.9 million with an impairment to two of the purchased power contracts, the WNP-3 BPA Exchange Power contract and the Rock Island hydro contract.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P239_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the carrying value for the WNP-3 BPA intangible asset contract was $1.9 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was less than zero thereby requiring a full write-off of the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P239_S3	The carrying value for the Rock Island intangible asset contract was $44.9 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be $9.8 million thereby requiring a $35.1 million write-down of the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P240_S0	The Company has a qualified employee Investment Plan which is a 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P240_S1	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6% of plan compensation, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P240_S2	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55% of an employee s contribution up to 6% of plan compensation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P240_S3	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $14.5 million , $13.5 million and $11.8 million for the years 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P241_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P242_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all PSE employees.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P242_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary and years of service.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P242_S2	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P243_S0	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for employees.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P243_S1	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P243_S2	The insurance premiums are based on the benefits provided during the year, and are paid primarily by retirees.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P244_S0	The following tables summarize the Company s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets and amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P245_S0	_________________ A curtailment gain was recognized in OCI due to the plan amendment that ceased SERP benefits for non-officers still in the plan as of December 31, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P246_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's pension benefit amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and Puget Sound Energy's net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P248_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and Puget Sound Energy's benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1085392_13_ITEM8_P249_S0	The estimated net/(loss) gain and prior service/(cost) credit for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 by Puget Energy are $(2.6) million and $2.0 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P249_S1	The estimated net (loss)/gain for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 are $(1.5) million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P249_S2	The estimated prior service (cost)/credit for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 is immaterial .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P249_S3	The estimated net (loss)/gain, prior service cost/(credit) and transition/(obligation) asset for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 are immaterial.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P250_S0	The estimated net (loss)/gain and prior service (cost)/credit for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 by Puget Sound Energy are $(20.3) million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P250_S1	The estimated net loss/(gain) and prior service (cost)/credit for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 are $(2.2) million .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P250_S2	The estimated prior service (cost)/credit for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 is immaterial .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P250_S3	The estimated net (loss)/gain for the other postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2013 is $0.1 million and prior service (cost)/credit and transition (obligation)/asset for the other postretirement plans are immaterial.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P250_S4	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2013 are expected to be at least $20.4 million , $5.0 million and $0.8 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P251_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P252_S0	_______________ The Company calculates the present value of the pension liability using a discount rate of 4.15% which represents the single-rate equivalent of the AA rated corporate bond yield curve.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P253_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 7.50% in 2013 grading down to 4.80% in 2014 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P253_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P254_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P254_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P255_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P255_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains/losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P255_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P255_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P256_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P256_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P257_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P257_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P258_S0	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P258_S1	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P259_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P260_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P260_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P261_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P261_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P262_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P262_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P263_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P264_S0	Plan Fair Value Measurements ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P264_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P265_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P265_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P266_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 :

1085392_13_ITEM8_P269_S2	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P270_S0	The tactical asset allocation investment is comprised of a commingled fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P271_S0	Fixed income securities consist of a mutual fund.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P271_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P272_S0	As of December 31, 2012 absolute return investments consist of two partnerships.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P272_S1	The partnerships are valued using the financial reports as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P272_S2	These investments are a Level 3 under ASC 820 because the significant valuation inputs are primarily internal to the partnerships with little third party involvement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P273_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P273_S1	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P274_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P275_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P275_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P275_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P276_S0	This is a money market fund.

1085392_13_ITEM8_P279_S0	The following reconciliation compares pre-tax book income at the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the actual income tax expense in the Statements of Income:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P280_S0	The Company s deferred tax liability at December 31, 2012 and 2011 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P281_S0	The above amounts have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P282_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P282_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P283_S0	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P283_S1	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2026 through 2032.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P283_S2	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2032.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P284_S0	For ratemaking purposes, deferred taxes are not provided for certain temporary differences.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P284_S1	PSE has established a regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through future rates related to those temporary differences for which no deferred taxes have been provided, based on prior and expected future ratemaking treatment.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P285_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P285_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P286_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P286_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P287_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P287_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P287_S2	For ASC 740 purposes, the Company has open tax years from 2006 through 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P287_S3	The Company is under audit by the IRS for tax years 2006 through 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P287_S4	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S0	Residential Exchange The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S1	The program is administered by the BPA.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S3	In 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S4	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 period and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S5	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement that by its terms, if upheld in its entirety, would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for fiscal years 2002-2011 and determine REP benefits for fiscal years 2012-2028.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S6	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into this most recent settlement agreement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S7	Oral argument in the Ninth Circuit on this litigation occurred on February 19, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S8	Pending disposition of this challenge, the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits has been stayed by the Ninth Circuit.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S9	Due to the pending and ongoing proceedings, PSE is unable to reasonably estimate any amounts of REP payments either to be recovered by the BPA or to be paid for any future periods to PSE, and is unable to determine the impact, if any, these proceedings and litigation may have on PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P288_S10	However, the Company believes it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through to PSE's residential and small farm customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P289_S0	Notice of Intent to Sue PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S0	On July 25, 2012, a Notice of Intent to Sue for violations of the Clean Air Act at Colstrip Steam Electric Station was sent to PSE from the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S1	The notice, which was amended on August 30, 2012, September 27, 2012, and December 1, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S2	was addressed to the owner or managing agent of Colstrip and to the other Colstrip co-owners, including PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S3	The notices allege violations of the Clean Air Act and state that the Sierra Club and MEIC will request a United States District Court to impose injunctive relief and civil penalties, require a beneficial environmental project in the areas affected by the alleged air pollution and require reimbursement of Sierra Club's and MEIC's costs of litigation and attorney's fees.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S4	Under the Clean Air Act, lawsuits cannot be filed until 60 days after the applicable notice date.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P290_S5	PSE is evaluating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P291_S0	Other Proceedings The Company is also involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P291_S1	The Company has recorded reserves of $3.4 million and $3.8 million relating to these claims as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S0	In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (ASC 810), a business entity that has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE in its financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S1	A primary beneficiary of a VIE is the variable interest holder that has both the power to direct matters that significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S2	The Company enters into a variety of contracts for energy with other counterparties and evaluates all contracts to determine if they are variable interests.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S3	The Company s variable interests primarily arise through power purchase agreements where it is required to buy all or a majority of generation from a plant at rates set forth in the agreement.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S4	The Company evaluated its power purchase agreements and determined it was not the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S5	The Company had previously disclosed two potentially significant variable interests in prior periods; both entities were qualifying facilities contracts that expired at the end of 2011 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S6	The Company requested information from the relevant entities; however, they refused to provide the necessary information, as they were not required to do so under their contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S7	However, if the variable interests had been determined to be VIEs, the Company concluded it would not have been the primary beneficiary of these entities based on available information and it had no exposure to loss on these contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S8	For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Company s purchased power expense from these entities was $175.9 million and $190.3 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P292_S9	The Company did not identify any variable interests during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2012 , approximately 17.5% of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately $0.018 per kilowatt hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to the contractual shares that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P293_S5	The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P294_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs' projects as set forth in the following table:
1085392_13_ITEM8_P295_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated payment obligations for power purchases from the Columbia River projects, contracts with other utilities and contracts with non-utilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P295_S1	These contracts have varying terms and may include escalation and termination provisions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P296_S0	Total purchased power contracts provided the Company with approximately 6.1 million , 8.5 million and 8.2 million megawatt hours (MWh) of firm energy at a cost of approximately $203.1 million , $391.8 million and $420.6 million for the years 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P296_S1	The Company has natural gas-fired generation facility obligations for natural gas supply amounting to an estimated $53.4 million in 2013 .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P296_S2	Longer term agreements for natural gas supply amount to an estimated $417.8 million for 2013 through 2030.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P297_S0	PSE enters into short-term energy supply contracts to meet its core customer needs.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P297_S1	These contracts are sometimes classified as NPNS, however in most cases recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 815.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P297_S2	Commitments under these contracts are $297.0 million , $189.6 million and $51.3 million in 2013 , 2014 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P298_S0	The Company has also entered into various firm supply, transportation and storage service contracts in order to ensure adequate availability of natural gas supply for its firm customers.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P298_S1	Many of these contracts, which have remaining terms from less than one year to 32 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual usage.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P298_S2	The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery obligation to ensure service to PSE s customers and generation requirements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P299_S0	The Company incurred demand charges in 2012 for firm transportation service and firm storage and peaking service of $142.6 million and $6.6 million , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P299_S1	The demand charge for firm natural gas supply was immaterial in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P299_S2	The Company incurred demand charges in 2012 for firm transportation and firm storage service for the natural gas supply for its combustion turbines in the amount of $31.5 million , which is included in the total Company demand charges.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P299_S3	The following table summarizes the Company s obligations for future demand charges through the primary terms of its existing contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P299_S4	The quantified obligations are based on the FERC and NEB (National Energy Board) authorized rates, which are subject to change.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P300_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated obligations for service contracts through the terms of its existing contracts.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P301_S0	_______________ Energy production service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts on Mint Farm, Wild Horse, Goldendale electric generating facility ( Goldendale), Hopkins Ridge, Frederickson 1, Sumas, Ferndale and Lower Snake River facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P302_S0	Automated meter reading system contractual obligation is the service component of the Landis and Gyr contract.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P303_S0	For information regarding PSE's environmental remediation obligations, see Note 3 Regulation and Rates.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a Demand Promissory Note (Note).
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S1	Through the Note, PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy, subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S2	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S3	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S4	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $29.6 million and $30.0 million , respectively, and the interest rate was 0.5% and 1.6% , respectively.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S5	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P304_S6	The $30.0 million credit facility with Puget Energy was unaffected by the merger.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P305_S0	On June 3, 2011, Puget Energy issued $500.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P305_S1	Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. acted as a co-manager and underwriter of this issue.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P305_S2	Net proceeds of $484.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding $782.0 million term-loan.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P306_S0	Puget Energy s term-loan and credit facility for funding capital expenditures both were originally scheduled to mature in February 2014, and were syndicated among numerous committed banks and other financial institutions.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P306_S1	One of these banks was Macquarie Bank Limited.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P306_S2	On February 10, 2012, Puget Energy terminated the term loan and capital expenditure facility and replaced them with a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P306_S3	There are no related parties with commitments under the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P307_S0	Concurrent with the borrowings under the term loan and capital expenditure credit agreements, Puget Energy entered into several interest rate swap instruments to hedge volatility associated with these two loans.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P307_S1	Two of the swap instruments were entered into with Macquarie Bank Limited with a total notional amount of $444.9 million .

1085392_13_ITEM8_P309_S2	Reconciling items between segments are not significant.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P309_S3	Effective February 6, 2009, all merger related fair value adjustments under ASC 805, were retained in Puget Energy.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P309_S4	Accordingly, only the financial statements of Puget Energy were adjusted to reflect the purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P309_S5	Prior to the merger, the business segment financial statements for Puget Energy and PSE were the same.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P310_S0	The following unaudited amounts, in the opinion of the Company, include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim periods.
1085392_13_ITEM8_P311_S0	Quarterly amounts vary during the year due to the seasonal nature of the utility business.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P2_S0	Marla D. Mellies, Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer; This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P3_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P4_S0	Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P5_S0	Align compensation payment levels with achievement of Company goals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P6_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P6_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of its executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (Cook Co.).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P6_S2	The Committee recommends the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Cook Co., and recommends the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO, to the full Board for approval.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P6_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval of the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of awards under those plans.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P7_S0	In 2012, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P8_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total pay opportunity.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P8_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P8_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets base salary and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive compensation) to the 50th percentile of this comparator group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P8_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P8_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P9_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P10_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P11_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P11_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded solely for meeting and exceeding target levels of annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P11_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P12_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P13_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S0	Execute the Company s succession planning process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings with her executive team.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S3	The talent reviews include evaluations prepared within the Company and by external organizational development consultants.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S4	The Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P14_S5	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S2	Since the Company is no longer publicly listed following its merger in February 2009 and no longer grants equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S3	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group and is also designed to achieve current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S4	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive programs are designed to comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S5	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P15_S6	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2012 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P16_S0	annually reviews total compensation opportunity and actual total compensation received over the prior years by each executive officer in the form of a tally sheet.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P16_S1	This review helps inform the Committee s decisions on program designs by allowing the Committee to review overall pay received in relation to Company results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P17_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness In making compensation decisions on base salary, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive programs, management prepares comprehensive compensation surveys for review by the Committee and Cook Co.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P17_S1	The surveys summarize data provided by the Towers Watson 2011 Energy Services survey for a selection of utility and other companies that are most similar in scope and size to PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P17_S2	For the review of compensation pay levels and practices in 2012, we included the following utility companies in our comparator group that were all of similar scope (generally $1.5 billion $6.0 billion revenue and $4.0 billion $12.0 billion asset size) and also participated in the Towers Watson 2011 Energy Services survey:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S0	Base pay and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive compensation) are targeted to the 50th percentile of the industry comparator group assuming the Company s performance goals are achieved at target.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, total direct compensation is lower than this targeted level.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S2	If Company performance significantly exceeds target, total cash compensation can approach or exceed the 75th percentile of the industry comparator group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S3	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S4	The Company may choose to pay an executive above or below the 50th percentile of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P18_S5	In addition to the foregoing survey data, the Committee also received advice from Cook Co. in connection with 2012 compensation decisions.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P19_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P19_S1	Base salaries are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of the comparator group and are reviewed annually by the Committee on an individual basis using as a guideline, the 50th percentile salary levels of our comparator group, as well as internal pay equity among our executives.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P19_S2	Actual salaries vary by individual and depend on additional factors, such as an individual s expertise, level of performance achievement, level of experience and level of contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P20_S0	Base Salary Adjustments The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2012 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P20_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries, and base salaries for 2012 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P20_S2	Effective March 1, 2012, the Board increased the base salary of Ms. Harris, President and CEO, from $720,000 to $820,000.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P20_S3	In establishing the salary amount for Ms. Harris, the Committee recommended and the Board approved a base salary that continued to be below the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group, reflecting Ms. Harris's recent tenure as President and CEO of the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P20_S4	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were in a range of 2% to 5%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees, except for Mr. Doyle who joined the Company on November 18, 2011 and did not receive a salary increase in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P21_S0	Our annual and long-term incentive plan (LTI Plan) help focus executives on the priorities of our investors and customers and reward performance that meets or exceeds pre-established goals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P21_S1	The Company s annual incentive plan rewards employees for the Company s performance on Service Quality Indices (SQIs), employee safety and EBITDA.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P23_S0	The Company's LTI Plan rewards employees for the Company's performance on Total Return and Return on Equity (ROE).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P23_S1	The performance measures of EBITDA, Total Return, and ROE are indicators of economic return to our investors, and their accomplishment indicates to our customers that the Company has the financial strength needed for long-term sustainability.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S0	2012 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives to executives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S2	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S3	For 2012, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against 9 SQIs covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S4	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S5	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S6	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards .
1085392_13_ITEM11_P24_S7	The SQIs for 2012 were as follows:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P25_S0	In 2012, to emphasize the Company's continued commitment to employee safety, the Company added a new safety performance measure to the annual incentive plan funding in addition to the SQIs and EBITDA.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P25_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the 9 SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P25_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P26_S0	The safety performance measure contains five targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P27_S0	Frontline supervisors receive appropriate safety and health training.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P27_S1	New employees receive applicable safety and health orientation.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P28_S0	Actively reduce the risk of ergonomic office injuries.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P28_S1	Reduce the Company Total Incident Case Rate (TICR) by 4% of the year end 2011 TICR.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P28_S2	Reduce the Company Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) by 15% of the year end 2011 LWCR.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P29_S0	In 2012, the annual incentive funding table required achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all 9 SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and target EBITDA performance for 100% funding of the plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P29_S1	Funding levels at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P30_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not exclude any items for 2012.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P31_S1	Individual goals were developed from the overall corporate goals for 2012, set forth below:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P32_S0	Take Safety to the People -Engage our customers and the general public in safety, extending our Nobody Gets Hurt Today program beyond our employees and service providers in order to better serve our community and region while reinforcing our internal commitment to safety.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P33_S0	Deliver the Big S Projects - Ensure a seamless transition to the successful deployment of the Geospatial Information System (GIS), Outage Management System (OMS) and Customer Information System (CIS) in order to provide greater dependability, improved customer service and more efficient use of customer dollars.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P34_S0	Watch the Dollars - Serve our customers and achieve our 2012-2016 plan goals through prioritizing our work around those activities that drive the safe, dependable and efficient delivery of electricity and natural gas.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P35_S0	2012 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2012 was above target for EBITDA, and at target for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P35_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,101.3 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 10 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2012 of 111.28% under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P36_S0	For 2012, individual target incentive levels for this plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2012 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the individual executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P36_S1	Target annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for participating executives remained unchanged from 2011 levels except for Mr. Doyle who was not eligible to participate in the 2011 annual incentive plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P36_S2	The maximum incentive for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P37_S0	As described above, an executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on a subjective assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P37_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met or exceeded by each executive, small adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of the Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2012 and the following amounts were approved by the Board and paid at the amounts as shown below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P37_S2	The adjustments for individual performance did not materially change amounts from the formula amount of 111.28% of target.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P37_S3	The Committee similarly recommended an award amount for the CEO which included a small adjustment for individual performance in 2012 and to recognize that the Company exceeded 2012 annual incentive goals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P37_S4	The Board approved the amounts shown below, which were paid in March 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P38_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P39_S0	Prior to completion of our merger in February 2009, executives received equity awards under the Puget Energy 2005 LTI Plan in the form of performance shares and performance-based restricted stock.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P39_S1	Awards generally vested based on the Company achieving a targeted level of performance during a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P39_S2	Following our merger, the Company has continued the basic design of the pre-merger LTI Plan, including retention of three-year performance cycles that begin each year.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P39_S3	Since the Company no longer grants equity awards to its employees, LTI Plan awards are now denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P40_S0	The Committee determines the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating the actual payment and forecast target payment of long-term incentive awards of our market comparator group for comparable levels of responsibility.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P40_S1	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when granting annual incentive awards or making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P41_S0	Each year s grant is primarily viewed in the context of the compensation opportunity needed to maintain the Company s competitive position relative to the comparator group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P42_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the actual level of achievement of the performance measures as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P43_S0	is measured at the Puget Holdings level and is re-calculated each year based on the change in Total Return for the prior year as measured by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P44_S0	Total Return reflects the annual change in the value of the Company plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P44_S1	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, disability or death.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P45_S0	The tables and points below summarize the performance measures and design of the LTI Plan grants for the performance cycles indicated below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P46_S0	______________ * CEO grants are split 30% SQI Component and 70% Total Return Component.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P46_S1	** Total Return Component is determined based on a combination of Total Return and 3-year average SQI results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S0	Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Measures for 2012-2014 As described above, the LTI Plan structure from 2009 through 2011 maintained the basic design which had been in place prior to the Company's merger in 2009.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S1	Effective with the 2012-2014 LTI Plan grants, the Board approved certain modifications to the performance measures under the LTI Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S2	Pursuant to these modifications, SQI achievement has been removed as a performance measure from the 2012-2014 performance cycle in favor of a new performance measures, Return on Equity (ROE).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S3	Total Return remains a second key performance measure under the 2012-2014 performance cycle, consistent with prior performance cycles under the LTI Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S4	SQI achievement was removed to make the plan easier to understand and to remove the duplication of awards based on SQI performance, since SQI performance is already a performance measure under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S5	As a result of the modifications, both LTI Plan performance measures for the 2012-2014 performance cycle are financial in nature and each is weighted 50%.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S6	The Board modified the performance measures and related levels of achievement percentages that trigger payouts in order to ensure that the LTI Plan continues to be viewed as an incentive by the participants and aligns the interests of participants with the long-term success of the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S7	Other aspects of the program, such as three-year performance cycles and the target levels of grants (as a percentage of annual base salary at the time of grant), remain unchanged from the 2011-2013 performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P47_S8	The Board felt that ROE was an appropriate measure to add to the LTI Plan, since Company management has been tracking ROE and seeking to improve Company results on this measure.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P48_S0	The ROE performance is measured each year by comparing actual ROE to the approved financial plan's ROE for that year.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P48_S1	The average of each year during the three-year performance cycle will determine the final ROE award.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P48_S2	With the implementation of solely financial performance measures, the President and CEO position received grants of LTI Plan units with a 50%/50% split between Total Return and ROE, like all other LTI Plan participants.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P49_S0	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2012-2014 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P49_S1	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2012-2014 performance cycle were 170% of base salary for Ms. Harris; 95% for Mr. Doyle, Ms. McLain, Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Mellies, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2011-2013 performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P49_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer for the 2012-2014 performance cycle is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $36.03.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P49_S3	The maximum incentive payable if exceptional performance is achieved on both performance measures for the LTI Plan is twice the target LTI Plan award.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P49_S4	Details of the number of units granted and expected value can be found in the 2012 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P50_S0	Long Term Incentive Plan Performance Measures for 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 With respect to the 2010-2012 and 2011-2013 performance cycles, except for the CEO, 50% of each grant of LTI Plan units is allocated to achievement of SQIs only (SQI component) and 50% is allocated to achievement of a combination of SQIs and Total Return (Total Return component).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P50_S1	The CEO s LTI Plan units are allocated 30% to the SQI component and 70% to the Total Return component to place additional weight on financial measures, consistent with our comparator group companies.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P50_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P50_S3	For the 2011-2013 performance cycle, the initial per unit value was $33.80.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P51_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the actual level of achievement of SQIs and Total Return as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P51_S1	For any award to be earned in the 2010-2012 performance cycle or the 2011-2013 performance cycle, average SQI results must meet or exceed 80% accomplishment of the applicable SQIs.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P52_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards that will be earned based on three-year average SQI achievement.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P53_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return Component that will be earned based on three-year performance.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P53_S1	Percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P54_S0	A target number of units are granted under this component at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of 80% of SQIs during the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P54_S1	The actual award is paid at target level if an average of at least 80% of SQIs are satisfied during the performance cycle, but is not paid if the average is below 80%.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P54_S2	If targeted SQI performance is met, the amount payable is equal to the product of the target number of units granted under this component and the per unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P55_S0	If 80% of SQIs are met during the performance cycle, but the Total Return threshold of 10% is not met, the SQI component will still be paid at target.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P56_S0	A target number of units are granted under this component at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of Total Return and SQI performance during the three-year performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P56_S1	The actual award paid is based on Company performance relative to target, subject to a minimum threshold level of performance of 10% for Total Return (based on average Total Return over the performance cycle) and average SQI achievement of 80%.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P57_S0	The LTI Plan unit value is determined annually by applying the Total Return for each year to the prior year s unit price.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P58_S0	At the completion of the performance cycle, if the Total Return component is paid, the participant receives a cash payment equal to the number of units earned under this component based on performance during the performance cycle multiplied by the unit price at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P59_S0	If the Total Return component exceeds 10% annualized 3-year return, but the SQI threshold is not met, the Total Return component will not be paid.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P60_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2014.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P61_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2012 below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P62_S0	Performance on the ROE component for 2012 was above the target level.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P62_S1	This result will be one of the three annual ROE results averaged at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P63_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P64_S0	Performance on the SQI component was at 9 out of 9 for both 2011 and 2012, which if continued for the remaining year of the performance cycle would mean that the SQI component would pay based on the target number of units granted to a Named Executive Officer.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P65_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2012 and 2011 has been a combined two-year average which is below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P66_S0	2010-2012 Performance Cycle: The 2010-2012 performance cycle has now ended and had the performance described below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P67_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the table below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P68_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the combined three-year average was a compounded annual rate of 4.8%, below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P69_S0	______________ 2010-2012 Actual LTI Plan amount payable is unit price $36.32 multiplied by SQI Component units.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P70_S0	The Company maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of PSE (Retirement Plan).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P70_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P71_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P71_S1	The Committee reviewed the SERP plan during 2012 with input from Cook Co. and modified the plan design to ensure alignment with competitive practices and with the retention goals of the program.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P71_S2	The plan changes were effective January 1, 2013 and include a requirement that new participants reach age 55 in order to vest in accrued benefits (in addition to existing vesting requirements) and a revision to the calculation of highest average earnings to require the use of three consecutive years of eligible compensation in the last ten years of service.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P71_S3	The plan changes do not increase the expected cost of the SERP program, and in certain instances would decrease program costs.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P71_S4	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2012 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P72_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P72_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P73_S0	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P74_S0	but effective for deferrals after December 31, 2011, it is based on a money market rate.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P75_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P75_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P75_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2012 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P76_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company), which amended and restated then existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the executives.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P76_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provided for an employment period of two years following the February 6, 2009 completion of the merger and otherwise generally provide benefits similar to those under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P76_S2	Since the 2009 merger, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P77_S0	The Company entered into these agreements for two primary reasons.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P78_S0	First, many executives when joining a new company require a level of assurance that they will receive pay in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control after they join the company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P78_S1	Second, the Company provided these agreements so that executives are focused on the Company s ongoing operations and are not distracted by the employment uncertainty that can arise in the event of a change in control.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P79_S0	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the comparator group.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P79_S1	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P80_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 30, 2012, the last business day of 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites targeted to competitive practices.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services, business club memberships and executive physicals up to an annual limit.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for individual use of club facilities.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P81_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and do not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P82_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P83_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value incentive opportunity for annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target level award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P83_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P84_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P85_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P86_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P86_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P87_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for achievement of Company goals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P87_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P87_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P87_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P88_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P88_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2012, except as noted below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P89_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P89_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P90_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P91_S0	The following information is furnished for the year ended December 31, 2012 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P91_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Ms. McLain, Mr. Wiegand, and Ms. Mellies are executives of PSE only.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P91_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P92_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P93_S0	___________________ For 2012, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2012 Goals and Incentive Plan, cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2010-2012 performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P93_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2013 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P93_S2	The 2012 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P94_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P94_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P94_S2	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2012 Pension Benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P94_S3	The change in pension value amounts for 2012 are: Ms. Harris, $1,722,264; Mr. Doyle, $147,857; Ms. McLain, $367,706; Mr. Wiegand, $404,467; and Ms. Mellies, $259,656.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P95_S0	Also included in this column are the portions of Deferred Compensation Plan earnings that are considered above market.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P95_S1	These amounts for 2012 are: Ms. Harris, $3,116; Mr. Doyle, $0; Ms. McLain, $12,028; Mr. Wiegand, $3,313; and Ms. Mellies, $436.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P95_S2	See the 2012 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table for all Deferred Compensation Plan earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P95_S3	All Other Compensation for 2012 is shown in detail in the table below.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P96_S0	Ms. Harris was promoted to President and CEO from President on March 1, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P96_S1	Mr. Doyle joined PSE and Puget Energy as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on November 28, 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P97_S0	_______________ After an initial reimbursement up to $7,500, annual reimbursement for financial planning, tax planning, and/or legal planning, up to a maximum of $5,000 for Ms. Harris and $2,500 for the other Named Executive Officers.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P98_S0	Club use is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P98_S1	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P99_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P100_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2012 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P101_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2012 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2012 of $969.3 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P101_S1	Payment would be $0 if either trigger is not met.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P101_S2	The threshold estimate assumes $969.3 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P101_S3	The target estimate assumes $1,077.0 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P101_S4	The maximum estimate assumes $1454.0 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P102_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants were allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P102_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P103_S0	2012 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P103_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P103_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P103_S3	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P104_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P104_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2012 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are 4.0% for 2013 and are assumed to be 4.0% through 2017, and 5.0% annually thereafter.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S2	The discount assumption is 4.15%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2013 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S3	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.75%, 4.62% and 5.72% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2012).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S4	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S5	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2011 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2011.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S6	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0% for 2012 and 5.0% for all future years, a discount assumption of 4.75% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2012 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S7	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 2.06%, 5.25% and 6.32% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2011).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P105_S8	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2011 were the same as those used for December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P106_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P106_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P107_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P107_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Dan Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible salaried employees, including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S3	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S4	For 2009 through 2011, the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit was $245,000.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S5	For 2012, the limit was $250,000.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S6	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S7	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S8	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P108_S9	For 2012 and 2013 the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S4	This reduction is subsidized that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P109_S7	As of December 31, 2012, all the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P110_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P110_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P111_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P111_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P111_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P111_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P111_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P112_S0	If a participant in the cash balance portion of the Retirement Plan dies while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, then his or her Retirement Plan benefit will be immediately vested.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P112_S1	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P112_S2	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P113_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P113_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Company modified certain features of the SERP, effective January 1, 2013, to ensure alignment with competitive practices and with the retention goals of the plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S1	The plan changes do not increase the expected cost of the SERP program, and in certain instances would decrease program costs.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S2	The plan changes include an additional vesting requirement for new participants to attain age 55 prior to vesting and a modified calculation of highest average earnings for all participants.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S3	The changes are reflected below in the description of SERP benefit calculations.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S4	The changes apply to existing and prospective SERP participants unless otherwise noted.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S5	For an existing participant, the change requiring consecutive years in the highest average earnings definition could result in a lower SERP benefit amount if high earnings years are not consecutive, compared to the benefit amount calculated under plan terms prior to January 1, 2013.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P114_S6	On an ongoing basis, as new participants join the program, the plan changes will lead to reduced aggregate costs attributable to SERP.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P115_S0	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P115_S1	All the participating Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P115_S2	SERP participants as of December 31, 2012, who had not yet attained age 55 at that date, including Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P115_S3	The Board added a special vesting requirement for Ms. Harris to continue Company service through December 31, 2016 in order to vest additional SERP benefit value after December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P116_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a vested executive (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below: (1) One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P116_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P116_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P117_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P117_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P117_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P118_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P118_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P119_S1	(3) The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P119_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2012 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S4	Ms. McLain and Mr. Wiegand are the only Named Executive Officers eligible for early retirement benefit payments under the SERP as of December 31, 2012.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S5	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S6	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S7	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P120_S8	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P123_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P123_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P123_S3	The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P123_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P124_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P124_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P124_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P124_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P124_S4	The 2012 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_13_ITEM11_P125_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P126_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P127_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P128_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P128_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P128_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P128_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P129_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P129_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P129_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).
1085392_13_ITEM11_P129_S3	Ms. McLain and Mr. Wiegand are the only Named Executive Officers currently retirement eligible under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P131_S1	In addition, each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Doyle, entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with the Company in March 2009, which provides for benefits or payments upon certain terminations of employment from the Company following the 2009 merger or a subsequent change in control.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P131_S2	The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, described below.

1085392_13_ITEM11_P140_S1	No act or failure to act on the Covered Executive s part is considered willful unless the Covered Executive has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that the Covered Executive s action or failure to act was in the best interests of the Company.
1085392_13_ITEM11_P141_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.

1085392_13_ITEM13_P0_S1	Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P1_S0	A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule.

1085392_13_ITEM13_P3_S0	If the Chief Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P4_S0	If disclosure is required, the Chief Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction.

1085392_13_ITEM13_P12_S0	Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Independence of the Board The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P12_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, William Ayer (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Mary McWilliams (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Melanie Dressel (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), and Herbert Simon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P13_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P13_S1	The Company s definition of Independent Director is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P14_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P14_S1	The Board has also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P14_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P14_S3	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P15_S0	Messrs. Ayer and Simon, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P15_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P15_S2	In addition, PSE has entered into transactions with entities for whom Mr. Simon and Mr. Ayer serve as a director, or in which they otherwise have a financial interest, that involve amounts that are less than the greater of $1.0 million or 1% of those entities consolidated gross revenue.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P15_S3	These transactions fall within the second categorical standard described above.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P15_S4	Because these relationships either fall within the Board s categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P16_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_13_ITEM13_P16_S1	Mr. Ayer, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.

1085392_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	GENERAL Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	Corporate Strategy Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	The following table presents the number of PSE customers as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	During 2013 , PSE s billed retail and transportation revenue from electric utility operations were derived 53.3% from residential customers, 40.2% from commercial customers, 5.2% from industrial customers and 1.3% from other customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P6_S1	PSE s billed retail revenue from natural gas utility operations were derived 66.9% from residential customers, 28.7% from commercial customers, 2.7% from industrial customers and 1.6% from transportation customers in 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM1_P6_S2	During this period, the largest customer accounted for approximately 1.5% of PSE s operating revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	PSE is affected by various seasonal weather patterns and therefore, utility revenue and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	Energy usage varies seasonally and monthly, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	PSE experiences its highest retail energy sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	Sales of electricity to wholesale customers also vary by quarter and year depending principally upon fundamental market factors and weather conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	PSE has a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism in retail electric rates to recover variations in electricity costs on a shared basis with customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE also has a Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	In the five-year period ended December 31, 2013 , PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.9 billion and retirements were $385.9 million .
1085392_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2013 was approximately $9.3 billion , which consisted of 34.7% distribution, 42.5% generation, 12.5% transmission and 10.3% general plant and other.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	Gross natural gas utility plant at December 31, 2013 was approximately $3.1 billion , which consisted of 92.8% distribution and 7.2% general plant and other.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2013 was approximately $565.1 million .
1085392_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	Employees At December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy had no employees and PSE had approximately 2,700 full-time employees.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P12_S1	Approximately 1,100 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P12_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire on September 30, 2017 and March 31, 2014, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	Corporate Location Puget Energy s and PSE s principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Item 10 Part III of this annual report.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	REGULATION AND RATES PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE filed revised tariffs seeking to update its rates established in its base rate proceedings in May 2012 known as an Expedited Rate Filing (ERF).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	The ERF was limited in scope and rate impact.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	This filing was primarily intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms, described below, are proposed to operate.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	The filing also provided for the collection of property taxes through a property tax tracker mechanism based on cash payments of property tax made by PSE during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P16_S4	Any difference between the cash payments and property tax valuation accruals will be deferred and recovered in a property tax tracker.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	Decoupling On October 25, 2012, PSE and the Northwest Energy Coalition (NWEC) filed a petition for an order seeking approval of an electric and a natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs and authority to record accounting entries associated with the mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	After the petition and supporting testimony were filed, the Washington Commission held two technical conferences to allow interested stakeholders to further discuss the proposed decoupling mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	PSE also responded to inquiries of interested stakeholders seeking additional information about the decoupling proposal.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	On March 4, 2013, PSE and NWEC, taking this process into account, reached an agreement on certain modifications to the decoupling mechanisms and filed an amended petition and testimony in support of these modifications to the original decoupling proposal.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	The Washington Commission's regulatory staff (Commission Staff) filed testimony in support of the revised proposal on the same day.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S5	Included in the amended decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another general rate case process over the plan period.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S6	The rate plan includes predetermined annual increases (K factor) to PSE's allowed electric and gas revenue which are effective January of each year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S7	Under this plan, PSE, with limited exceptions, would be allowed to file its next general rate case no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016 unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S8	PSE would continue to be authorized to file for rate changes under existing rate mechanisms such as the PCA and PGA mechanism, and emergency rate relief during the rate plan period.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S9	PSE's rates related to the cumulative deferred decoupling mechanism accrued by each rate group through the calendar year and effective May 1 in the following year will be subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S10	Any amount in excess of the soft cap will be added to the decoupling tracker in subsequent rate periods, subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases in the subsequent year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S11	In addition, PSE and the customers would have shared 50.0% each in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.77%.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P17_S12	The customers share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12 month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	TransAlta Centralia Agreement In 2012, PSE executed a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia for the purchase of up to 380 Megawatt (MW) of coal transition power.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	PSE filed a petition for approval of the TransAlta Centralia agreement and recovery of related acquisition costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P18_S2	The Washington Commission issued an order granting PSE's petition which contained conditions that left PSE with a level of uncertainty such that it could terminate the contract.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P18_S3	PSE subsequently filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the order with the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	Washington Commission Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, the power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the ERF which included the property tax tracker.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	The Washington Commission placed these filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued three final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S2	Order No. 6 rejected the multi-party settlement agreement between PSE, NWEC and Commission Staff due to uncertainty regarding the legality of consolidating the three filings.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S3	Order No. 7 approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S4	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed above.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S5	In addition, Order No. 7 approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing as filed by PSE and NWEC on March 4, 2013 with the requirement that PSE update the underlying ERF rates for the change in cost of capital, and with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S6	Order No. 8 granted PSE's Petition for Reconsideration, clarifying certain portions of the Washington Commission's original order.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S7	As approved, the ERF filing will produce an additional $30.7 million in annual electric revenue and reduce annual gas revenue by $2.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S8	The property tax rate tracker will initially produce no incremental revenue, but is intended to reduce regulatory lag associated with the recovery of future increases in property tax expenses.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S9	PSE's 2012 and 2013 property taxes that are not in current rates will be recovered in later years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S10	The decoupling mechanisms will initially produce an additional $21.4 million in annual electric revenue and $10.8 million in annual gas revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P20_S11	The allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P21_S3	As a result, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism and will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P22_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter are scheduled for May 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	Electric Rate Case On February 29, 2012, PSE filed proposed Federal Incentive Tracker tariff revisions, with stated effective dates of April 1, 2012, and subsequently revised by filing on March 29, 2012 with stated effective dates of June 1, 2012, to pass-through $2.4 million in interest on the unamortized balance of the Wild Horse wind project (Wild Horse) Expansion Treasury Grant.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	On June 26, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's methods and calculations and new rates became effective on July 3, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P25_S1	The rate change passed through 11 months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over 11 months beginning February 1, 2013, including grant amortization pass-back of $34.6 million and interest pass-back of $23.8 million.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P25_S2	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.76%.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	On October 23, 2013, the Washington Commission approved an update on the Company's Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), effective November 1, 2013, which reflected decreases in the overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	This resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of $10.5 million or 0.5% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	On December 27, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $58.5 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Of the total credit, $37.8 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $20.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2013 rate period.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.26%.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	Natural Gas Rate Case On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P28_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P29_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the overrecovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P29_S2	The Washington Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P29_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of $6.6 million, the difference being recognized as revenue sensitive taxes.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	The rates resulted in a decrease to the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	On May 1, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the proposed rates and allowed them to be made permanent.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is a decrease of $77.0 million, or 7.7% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	The rate adjustment has no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff, effective on November 1, 2013, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is an increase of $4.0 million, or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's Pipeline Replacement Program Plan (PRPP) that would accelerate and enhance the safety of the natural gas system and ultimately reduce costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Under the PRPP plan, PSE would be allowed to file a tariff revision to recover its costs associated with the acceleration of the replacement of natural gas pipelines with the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P32_S2	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

1085392_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	Average MW usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	ELECTRIC SUPPLY At December 31, 2013 , PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,831 megawatts (MW).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments that may include, but are not limited to, weather-related hedges.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	_______________ Net of 37 MW in 2013 and 38 MW in 2012 capacity delivered to Canada pursuant to the provisions of a treaty between Canada and the United States and Canadian Entitlement Allocation agreements.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	Power received from other utilities and firm contracts are classified between hydroelectric and other producers based on the character of the utility system used to supply the power or, if the power is supplied from a particular resource, the character of that resource.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	At December 31, 2013 , PSE owns the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 3,597 MW:
1085392_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	_______________ Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The FERC jurisdictional facility was operated pursuant to 50-year license granted by the FERC in October 2008.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	The license provides protection and enhancements for fish and wildlife, water quality, recreation and cultural and historic resources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	The FERC jurisdictional facility was operated pursuant to 40-year license granted by the FERC in June 2004.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P42_S3	At December 31, 2013, Electron project output was limited to approximately 7 MW due to the condition of the flume that conveys water to the plant.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P42_S4	This limitation is expected to continue into 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts During 2013 , approximately 15.1% of PSE s energy requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_14_ITEM1_P45_S0	_______________ PSE s share of power under the 2001 contract will decline over time as Grant County PUD s load increases.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	PSE s share of both the Priest Rapids and Wanapum developments was 0.8% at the end of 2013 and will not be less than 0.6% through 2052.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P46_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P46_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) (for 45 aMW of capacity) and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S1	Further, PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S2	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S3	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S4	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S5	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S6	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S7	In 2013 , PSE had 4,411 MW and 596 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P47_S8	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P48_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P48_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P48_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P48_S3	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P49_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P49_S1	During 2013 , approximately 88.0% of natural gas for power purchased by PSE for power customers originated in British Columbia and 12.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P50_S0	Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file electric and natural gas Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) every two years with the next IRP scheduled to be filed by May 30, 2015.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P50_S1	As part of the resource planning process, PSE filed an IRP in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P50_S2	The 2013 IRP identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_14_ITEM1_P51_S0	The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2013 IRP.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P51_S1	In 2013, PSE renewed all the Mid-Columbia transmission available for renewal during the year to meet peak capacity needs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P52_S0	As part of the 2013 PCORC, PSE sought approval for the Mid-C transmission renewals executed in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P52_S1	As the Washington Commission approved all the Mid-C transmission renewals requested in the 2013 PCORC, PSE expects to have sufficient resources to meet its capacity needs over the next few years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P52_S2	On February 6, 2014, the Washington Commission formally accepted PSE's 2013 IRP filing and requested additional dialogue regarding PSE's interest in the Colstrip generation plant in Montana.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P53_S0	NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P53_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed-price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P53_S2	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P53_S3	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P54_S0	_______________ All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P55_S0	For baseload, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in off-peak periods, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P55_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P56_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P56_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P56_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P56_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; and interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P57_S0	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P57_S1	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P57_S2	During 2013 , approximately 56.0% of natural gas supplies purchased by PSE for its gas customers originated in British Columbia, while 21.0% originated in Alberta and 23.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P58_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P58_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during off-peak periods to minimize costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P58_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) whenever on-system customer demand requirements permit and the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P59_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P59_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S0	Dekatherm (Dth) per day, which, after reduction for a portion temporarily released to the power portfolio and to a third party represents nearly 51.3% of PSE s expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S1	PSE s total firm storage capacity of the facility is approximately 9.8 million Dth.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S2	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S3	The owned storage capacity at Jackson Prairie is now 8.5 million Dth.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S4	Due to the recent expansion of Jackson Prairie storage withdrawal capacity and storage capacity, PSE s natural gas storage resources are expected to exceed natural gas customer requirements for the next few years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S5	Therefore, through March 2016, 50,000 Dth per day of natural gas storage withdrawal capacity and 500,000 Dth of natural gas storage capacity have been temporarily released at market rates to PSE s power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P60_S6	In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,000 Dth per day of Jackson Prairie Storage firm withdrawal capacity (and associated storage capacity) in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that is used primarily to reduce portfolio costs through supply management efforts that take advantage of market price volatility, and provides system reliability.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P61_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of four and six years, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P61_S2	PSE s maximum firm withdrawal capacity and total storage capacity at Clay Basin, net of releases, is over 74,000 Dth per day and exceeds 8.8 million Dth, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P62_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P62_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P63_S0	PSE contracts for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned gas at NWP s Plymouth facility, at a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P63_S1	During 2013, PSE, working with NWP, determined that the pipeline redelivery to PSE from the Plymouth LNG facility can no longer be considered firm and reliable during peak conditions, therefore PSE has removed the Plymouth service from its firm portfolio.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P63_S2	PSE is negotiating with other market participants to replace the Plymouth service with an alternate firm resource to accommodate expected future load growth.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P64_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P64_S1	This propane-air injection facility is designed to deliver the equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P65_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P66_S0	Natural Gas Transportation Capacity PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Spectra's Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P66_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S1	PSE holds approximately 523,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S2	In addition, PSE holds approximately 450,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S3	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NWP through various contracts that supply electric generating facilities with approximately 168,000 Dth per day.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S4	PSE participates in the pipeline capacity release market to achieve savings for PSE s customers and has released certain segments of temporarily surplus firm capacity to third parties.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S5	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 31 years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P67_S6	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P68_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is approximately 130,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of four to six years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P68_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling approximately 106,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of one to five years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P68_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to ten years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P68_S3	PSE has annual renewal rights on this capacity.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P68_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity on the GTN pipeline, totaling approximately 90,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of 10 years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P69_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P70_S0	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P70_S1	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P70_S2	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P70_S3	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	ENERGY EFFICIENCY PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue feasible, achievable, and cost-effective electric conservation.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	PSE recovers the actual costs of electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	However, the rider mechanisms do not provide for any cost recovery of lost sales margin associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P71_S5	To address this issue, PSE has received approval in 2013 from the Washington Commission for electric and gas decoupling mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	Since 1997 and 2012, PSE has recovered direct electric and gas energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures, respectively, through a rider mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects the efficiency expenditures in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P72_S2	As a result of the rider mechanism, direct electric and natural gas energy efficiency expenditures are recovered.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	ENVIRONMENT PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all have CAA Title V operation permits which must be renewed every five years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S2	This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S3	PSE continues to monitor these developments to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S4	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHGs), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P74_S5	Colstrip represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Act.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	Remediation of Contamination PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various contaminated sites.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE, as well as third party owned properties in which hazardous substances were generated or released.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	The primary cleanup laws PSE is subject to include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner, or operator of a contaminated site, as well as, any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes, as well as, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB) contaminated wastes.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and the dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	On April 7, 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of PCB-containing equipment.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S1	The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S2	This would likely remove all existing use authorizations for PCBs in electrical and gas pipeline equipment.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S3	As proposed, the ANPRM would mandate a phase out of in-service PCBs through a phased process with full removal achieved by 2025.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S4	The most recent extension indicates that the EPA will issue a final rule in July 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P81_S5	At this time, PSE cannot determine what the impacts of this ANPRM will have on its operations but will continue to work closely with the United Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments and advocate for a reasonable approach that would be protective of the environment and cost effective.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water, or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P82_S1	This includes most generation facilities (and all those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, as well as, other local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts to the fullest extent possible as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	RECENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND REGULATION Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on cost of PSE operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	Recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs are described below.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P85_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P85_S4	PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	The Tailoring Rule, which became effective January 2, 2011, sets permit levels for GHG emissions in two phases for power plants and other large stationary sources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	The ruling limits the amount of GHG emissions a facility can emit by requiring installment of Best Available Control Technology (BACT).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	Phase I requires existing facilities that emit more than 100,000 tons of emissions per year to comply with the new BACT rules when air permits are renewed or when major modifications are made after January 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S3	Phase II, effective July 2011, requires preconstruction permits using BACT for new projects that emit 100,000 tons of emissions per year or existing projects that make major modifications and that emit more than 75,000 tons per year.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S4	Currently the EPA has only released BACT guidance for coal technology.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S5	The EPA work to determine natural gas turbine BACT guidance is ongoing.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P86_S6	Potential impacts on Colstrip are being evaluated and impacts to our gas fleet cannot yet be determined.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	On March 27, 2012 EPA proposed a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) to limit carbon dioxide from new fossil fuel-fired electric generation units.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P87_S1	The proposed standard would only apply to new generating units.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P87_S2	The EPA did not propose standards for existing fossil fuel power plants, nor did it indicate a timeline for proposing these in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P87_S3	The proposed output-based standard for new units is 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	exiting power plants a requirement that States submit to the EPA the implementation plans required under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations by no later than June 30, 2016.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	Each year, PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the State of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the EPA.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S4	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2012 were 9.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S5	Approximately 41.4% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.1 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S6	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an essential part of the existing diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P89_S7	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P90_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P90_S1	Compliance based on a rolling 12-month average was first confirmed in January 2011 and has continued to meet the requirement.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P91_S0	EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P91_S1	The MATS rule establishes numerical emissions limitations at coal-fired power plants for mercury (1.2 lb/TBtu), acid gases, certain toxic metals using a particulate matter surrogate (0.03 lb/MMBtu), sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P91_S2	Generating units have 3 years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P91_S3	Testing confirms that Colstrip currently meets the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P92_S0	Units 3 4 meet the particulate surrogate for other metals.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P92_S1	Modifications to the Unit 1 2 scrubbers are required to meet the particulate limit in the MATS rule.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P92_S2	PSE has installed a sieve tray in one of the six scrubbers and will install them in the remaining scrubbers at an estimated cost to PSE of $10.5 million.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P92_S3	Testing of the scrubber subsequent to modification shows that it can meet the MATS particulate limit.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P93_S0	Additional Colstrip Emission Controls On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P93_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P94_S0	The final Federal Implementation Plan for Montana (FIP) for Regional Haze was issued in September 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P94_S1	There are no immediate requirements for Units 3 4, but Units 1 2 will need to upgrade pollution controls to meet new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P95_S0	The Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) of Appeals on November 15, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P95_S1	Discovery in the case has begun, and a prehearing conference took place in July 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P95_S2	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials set for March and August 2015, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P95_S3	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P96_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking for the Identification and Listing of Special Wastes: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) from Electric Utilities which proposes different regulatory mechanisms to regulate coal ash.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P96_S1	EPA does not have a schedule for issuing a final CCR regulation although a federal court is requiring the EPA to set a specific date for issuance of the final rule.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S0	The EPA proposed three alternative regulations.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S1	Under the first two options, coal ash could be regulated as a solid waste under Subtitle D provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S2	This would give authority to the states to oversee a set of performance standards for handling and disposal.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S3	Coal ash would be listed as non-hazardous but utilities may not be allowed to continue wet handling and the continued use of surface impoundments could be phased out.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S4	One of these two options would require significantly less modifications to closed as well as in-use impoundments.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S5	Under the third option, coal ash could be regulated as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C provisions of the RCRA, which would make coal ash subject to a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S6	Regulation under Subtitle C would essentially require the phase-out of wet handling and surface impoundments.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S7	The EPA estimates over 500 surface impoundments would be affected by this ruling.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S8	The impact to Colstrip operations and to PSE could range from minimal to significant.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P97_S9	Due to the wide range in the options proposed by the EPA, PSE cannot determine the potential impacts with any more certainty at this time.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P98_S0	the developments of the final rule and are advocating for a reasonable, non-hazardous approach that would be both protective of the environment and cost-effective.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P99_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 13, 2014 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P100_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P101_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 13, 2014 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_14_ITEM1_P102_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic test year costs plus normalized assumptions about rate year power costs, weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Non-energy costs for natural gas retail customers are based on historic test year costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S3	In addition, the Washington Commission decides what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S4	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P5_S5	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	PSE has additional risks associated with the Washington Commission approved stay out period, which doesn't allow for any general rate case filings to be filed earlier than April 1, 2015 without extraordinary circumstances.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	PSE will have additional risks if PSE's costs are not within the pre-approved annual increases in allowed revenue per customer (3.3% for electric customers; 2.2% natural gas customers), as earnings will be below the authorized rate of return and due to the stay out period, PSE cannot file for general rate increases unless it is for emergency rate relief.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S2	If PSE earns above its authorized rate of return, PSE will need to share the excess earnings above the threshold of 7.77% with customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so the risk would be if PSE over earns on one and under earns on the other service, PSE would still be obligated to share the earnings for that service exceeding the threshold (there is no offset for the service under earning).
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE may be unable to acquire energy supply resources to meet projected customer needs or may fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	PSE projects that future energy needs will exceed current purchased and Company owned and controlled power resources in the near future.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As part of PSE s business strategy, it plans to acquire additional electric generation and delivery infrastructure to meet customer needs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	If PSE cannot acquire additional energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could significantly increase its expenses thus reducing earnings and cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Additionally, PSE may not be able to timely recover some or all of those increased expenses through ratemaking.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	While PSE expects to identify the benefits of new energy supply resources prior to their acquisition and integration, it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such energy supply sources.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, increased customer demand for energy, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Factors which could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its load requirements and/or high volumes of energy purchased in wholesale markets at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods or acts of nature.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If PSE is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	PSE operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Despite its implementation of security measures, its technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, these cyber-based attacks could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P19_S4	As a result, PSE endeavors to maintain unceasing vigilance against the continuous threat of cyber-based attacks.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets as well as to supply and price risks affecting PSE s construction and maintenance programs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In connection with matching loads and resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy, and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P20_S6	Further, as a consequence of its electric generation construction and reconstruction programs and investments in its electric and gas distribution systems, PSE contracts to purchase substantial quantities of steel, cable, and similar materials, and thus is subject to supply and price risks affecting these items.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	To lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PSE may use forward delivery agreements, swaps and option contracts to hedge commodity price risk with a diverse group of counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	However, PSE does not always cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	To the extent PSE has unhedged positions or its hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could adversely impact its results of operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	To comply with these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	With respect to endangered species laws, the listing or proposed listing of several species of salmon in the Pacific Northwest is causing a number of changes to the operations of hydroelectric generating facilities on Pacific Northwest rivers, including the Columbia river.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These changes could reduce the amount, and increase the cost, of power generated by hydroelectric plants owned by PSE, or in which PSE has an interest, and increase the cost of the permitting process for these facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or the new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse gas legislation, including an emission performance standard provision.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	While PSE cannot yet determine costs associated with these or future decisions or potential future legislation, there may be a significant impact on the cost of carbon-intensive coal generation, in particular.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected for some classes of customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond and repair the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P29_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S1	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S2	PSE also hires third parties to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2014 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in general rate cases could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Potential municipalization or technological developments may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	When a town or city establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires our assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that we provide.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	This loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P36_S2	In addition, there is also the risk that advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P37_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P37_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, of which $299.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S1	PSE refinanced its credit facilities in February 2013 to two facilities with $1.0 billion in short-term borrowing capability, a five year contract, lower commitment fee rate, less restrictive covenants and an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S2	In conjunction with the new PSE agreement, the Puget Energy agreement was reduced to a total of $800.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.4 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2013 had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	limit the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital and the ability to hedge in wholesale markets.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Potential legislation and regulatory actions could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank law gave regulators including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities Exchange Commission the authority to create new oversight structures for derivative financial instruments, which were widely thought to have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The new legislation of certain over-the-counter swaps could expand collateral requirements of swaps, which may make it more costly for companies and/or limit the Company s ability to enter into such transactions.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Dodd-Frank amended section 2(h) (7) of the Commodities Exchange Act to provide an elective exemption from the clearing requirements of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for any entity that is not a financial entity, is using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and notifies the CFTC, in a manner set forth by the CFTC, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The Company has elected to employ the "End-User Exception" to clearing on its applicable treasury department transactions, and will likely employ the End-User Exception to clearing on commodities transactions after applicable final regulations for those transactions are adopted.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	The Company continues to evaluate the legislation and the CFTC s implementation of it to determine its impact, if any, on the Company s hedging program, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The Company is aware that the Dodd-Frank rules will increase recordkeeping and certain administrative costs for applicable transactions, but will not know the full impact of the new legislation until the regulations are finalized and the Company's compliance systems are fully implemented.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution, unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S8	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.4% at December 31, 2013 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.4 to 1.0 for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_14_ITEM1A_P49_S9	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Gas Supply.
1085392_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of legal proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S0	Residential Exchange The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S1	The program is administered by the BPA.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S3	In 2007, the Ninth Circuit ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S4	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 period and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S5	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement (2012 REP Settlement) that by its terms, if upheld in its entirety, would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for fiscal years 2002-2011 and determine REP benefits for fiscal years 2012-2028.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S6	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into the 2012 REP Settlement agreement.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S7	On October 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit issued an order dismissing this challenge to this settlement.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S8	In light of the disposition of this challenge, the stay of the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits was lifted in January 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S9	In the order lifting the stay, petitioners (unless they move to voluntarily dismiss their petitions) and intervenors (unless they move to voluntarily withdraw) were directed to file a statement explaining which issues, if any, remain pending.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S10	Such statements are due on or before April 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S11	PSE is unable to determine prior to April 1, if this other pending litigation will continue and, if so, what impact these proceedings may have on PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S12	However, the Company believes it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through directly to REP customers.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S13	With the Ninth Circuit s decision affirming the 2012 REP Settlement, PSE will receive approximately $57.0 million plus interests of REP payments owed under a 2008 agreement, which are in addition to scheduled monthly REP benefits received from BPA under the 2012 REP Settlement.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P1_S14	These payments will be given back to PSE's residential and small farm customers through a higher residential exchange credit on their bills.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P2_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P3_S0	On March 6, 2013, Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners (including PSE) alleging numerous claims for relief, most which relate to alleged prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) violations.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P3_S1	One claim relates to the alleged failure to update the Title V permit to reflect the major modifications alleged in the first thirty-six claims, another claim alleges that the previous Title V compliance certifications have been incomplete because they did not address the alleged major modifications, and the last claim alleges opacity violations since 2007.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P4_S0	The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District of Montana, Billings Division requesting injunctive relief and civil penalties, including a request that the owners remediate environmental damage and that $100,000 of the civil penalties be used for beneficial mitigation projects.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P4_S1	This lawsuit followed various Notices of Intent to Sue sent to Colstrip owners (including PSE) from the Sierra Club and the MEIC between July and December 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P4_S2	Discovery in the case has begun and a prehearing conference took place in July 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P4_S3	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials set for October 2014 and August 2015, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM3_P4_S4	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings, and are not publicly traded.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P0_S2	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P0_S3	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P0_S4	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	From time to time, when deemed advisable and permitted, each of PSE and Puget Energy pay dividends on its common stock.
1085392_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , each of PSE paid dividends to its parent, Puget Energy, and Puget Energy paid dividends to its parent, Puget Equico, in the amounts shown in Puget Energy's and PSE's Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity included in this report.
1085392_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables show selected financial data.
1085392_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with the Management Discussion and Analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.

1085392_14_ITEM6_P2_S2	The merger was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S1	The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy and PSE objectives, expectations and intentions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S2	Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S3	However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S4	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S5	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	OVERVIEW Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P3_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE's basis of accounting continues to be on a historical basis and PSE's financial statements do not include any purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P3_S4	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	To meet customer growth, to replace expiring power contracts and to meet Washington state s renewable energy portfolio standards, PSE is increasing energy efficiency programs to reduce the demand for additional energy generation and is pursuing additional renewable energy production resources (primarily wind) and base load natural gas-fired generation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Company's strategy is to be a safe, dependable, and efficient utility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P5_S3	The Company has made a commitment to become world-class in safety for employees, customers and communities; provide exceptional customer service; support and enhance the professional development of the workforce; work with stakeholders to ensure timely and consistent regulatory support; and drive necessary changes to maintain the financial strength of the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P5_S4	These investments and commitments related to utility infrastructure and customer service may give rise to expenditures, which may not be recovered timely through the ratemaking process.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	PSE has undertaken several initiatives to reduce the volatility and regulatory lag in the business.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S1	During 2013, PSE completed an Expedited Rate Filing (ERF), which is a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S2	The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate on going forward.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S3	The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between cash payments and property tax valuation accruals will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S4	The ERF filing increased electric general rates by $30.7 million and reduced natural gas rates by $2.0 million on an annual basis beginning July 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S5	The decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recovery costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S6	Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allowed PSE to earn its rate of return over the rate plan period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P6_S7	The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE s allowed electric and natural gas revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	2015 and no later than April 1, 2016.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	Upon implementation of the decoupling mechanism on July 1, 2013, electric and natural gas rates increased $21.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, on an annual basis.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The decoupling mechanism also allows for decoupling revenue on a per customer basis to subsequently increase by 3.0% for electric customers and 2.2% for natural gas customers on January 1 on each year, until the conclusion of PSE s next general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P8_S2	In October 2013, PSE completed a PCORC filing which allows PSE to recovery certain generation investments and updates PSE s overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P8_S3	As a result, PSE decreased electric rates by $10.5 million, annually, effective November 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	In October 2013, PSE received approval of its pipeline integrity program that would accelerate and enhance the safety of the natural gas system and ultimately reduce costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	Under the plan, PSE would be allowed to file a tariff revision to recover its costs associated with the acceleration of the replacement of natural gas pipelines with the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P9_S2	Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue conservation initiatives that promote efficient use of energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P9_S3	PSE s mandate to pursue conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P9_S4	This mandate, however, will only have a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year, PSE s net income was affected by the following four factors: (1) an increase in electric margin; (2) implementation of a property tax tracker mechanism which lowered property tax expense by reducing regulatory lag, thus matching expense with revenues; (3) reduction in amortization expenses primarily due to an increase in regulatory credit related to amortization of Treasury Grant; and (4) a decrease in unrealized gain in derivatives instruments for energy contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	Further detail on each of these primary drivers, as well as other factors affecting performance, is set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion Analysis.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized loss on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	The presentation of return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments is intended to supplement readers understanding of the Company s operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	Return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instrument is used by the Company to determine whether the Company is collecting the appropriate earnings from its customers to allow recovery of investor s capital.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	The return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity is not intended to represent the regulated return on equity.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	PSE's return on equity may not be comparable to other companies return on equity measures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace return on equity (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	The following table presents PSE s return on equity for 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), subsidiary retained earnings and retained earnings of derivative instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Company s 2013 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 8.0% , which is lower than the authorized return on equity primarily due to the following:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $15.6 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and customer service expense.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	Depreciation expense was $36.4 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric expenditures placed into service.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Company s 2012 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 7.7%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity primarily due to the following:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P20_S0	Operating revenue was $124.2 million lower than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P20_S1	However, margins increased $27.6 million due to significantly lower power costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P21_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $18.7 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P21_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and customer service expense.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P22_S0	Depreciation expense was $38.2 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P22_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric expenditures placed into service.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P23_S0	Utility rate making process has a delay between incurring expenses and their recovery in rate base.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P24_S0	PSE increased ratebase by $416.7 million since its last general rate increase effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P25_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance PSE s regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2013 and future years.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P25_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P25_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales, as well as by its customers conservation investments, which also tend to reduce energy sales.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P25_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Washington Commission has traditionally required that these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	cost growth, thus rate increases are required.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	If, in a particular year, PSE's costs are higher than what is currently allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	Commission determines whether expenses and investments are reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	If the Washington Commission determines that part of PSE's costs do not meet the standard applied, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE filed revised tariffs seeking to update its rates established in its base rate proceedings in May 2012 known as an Expedited Rate Filing (ERF).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	The ERF was limited in scope and rate impact.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	This filing was primarily intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms, described below, are proposed to operate.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	The filing also provided for the collection of property taxes through a property tax tracker mechanism based on cash payments of property tax made by PSE during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	Any difference between the cash payments and property tax valuation accruals will be deferred and recovered in a property tax tracker.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S0	Decoupling On October 25, 2012, PSE and the Northwest Energy Coalition (NWEC) filed a petition for an order seeking approval of an electric and a natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs and authority to record accounting entries associated with the mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S1	After the petition and supporting testimony were filed, the Washington Commission held two technical conferences to allow interested stakeholders to further discuss the proposed decoupling mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S2	PSE also responded to inquiries of interested stakeholders seeking additional information about the decoupling proposal.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S3	On March 4, 2013, PSE and NWEC, taking this process into account, reached an agreement on certain modifications to the decoupling mechanisms and filed an amended petition and testimony in support of these modifications to the original decoupling proposal.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S4	The Washington Commission's regulatory staff (Commission Staff) filed testimony in support of the revised proposal on the same day.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S5	Included in the amended decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another general rate case process over the plan period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S6	The rate plan includes predetermined annual increases (K factor) to PSE's allowed electric and gas revenue which are effective January of each year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S7	Under this plan, PSE, with limited exceptions, would be allowed to file its next general rate case no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016 unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S8	PSE would continue to be authorized to file for rate changes under existing rate mechanisms such as the PCA and PGA mechanism, and emergency rate relief during the rate plan period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S9	PSE's rates related to the cumulative deferred decoupling mechanism accrued by each rate group through the calendar year and effective May 1 in the following year will be subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S10	Any amount in excess of the soft cap will be added to the decoupling tracker in subsequent rate periods, subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases in the subsequent year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S11	In addition, PSE and the customers would have shared 50.0% each in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.77%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P30_S12	The customers share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12 month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P31_S0	TransAlta Centralia Agreement In 2012, PSE executed a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia for the purchase of up to 380 Megawatt (MW) of coal transition power.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P31_S1	PSE filed a petition for approval of the TransAlta Centralia agreement and recovery of related acquisition costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P31_S2	The Washington Commission issued an order granting PSE's petition which contained conditions that left PSE with a level of uncertainty such that it could terminate the contract.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P31_S3	PSE subsequently filed a Petition for Reconsideration of the order with the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P32_S0	Washington Commission Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P32_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, the power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the ERF which included the property tax tracker.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S0	The Washington Commission placed these filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued three final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S2	Order No. 6 rejected the multi-party settlement agreement between PSE, NWEC and Commission Staff due to uncertainty regarding the legality of consolidating the three filings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S3	Order No. 7 approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S4	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed above.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S5	In addition, Order No. 7 approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing as filed by PSE and NWEC on March 4, 2013 with the requirement that PSE update the underlying ERF rates for the change in cost of capital, and with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S6	Order No. 8 granted PSE's Petition for Reconsideration, clarifying certain portions of the Washington Commission's original order.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S7	As approved, the ERF filing will produce an additional $30.7 million in annual electric revenue and reduce annual gas revenue by $2.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S8	The property tax rate tracker will initially produce no incremental revenue, but is intended to reduce regulatory lag associated with the recovery of future increases in property tax expenses.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S9	PSE's 2012 and 2013 property taxes that are not in current rates will be recovered in later years.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P33_S10	The decoupling mechanisms will initially produce an additional $21.4 million in annual electric revenue and $10.8 million in annual gas revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P34_S0	of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P35_S0	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P35_S1	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P35_S2	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P35_S3	As a result, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism and will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P36_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P36_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P36_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter are scheduled for May 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P37_S0	Electric Rates PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P38_S0	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P38_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P38_S2	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P39_S0	PSE had a favorable PCA imbalance for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which was $37.8 million below the power cost baseline level, $8.9 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P39_S1	This compares to a favorable imbalance of $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , $3.7 million of which was apportioned to customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P40_S0	On February 29, 2012, PSE filed proposed Federal Incentive Tracker tariff revisions, with stated effective dates of April 1, 2012, and subsequently revised by filing on March 29, 2012 with stated effective dates of June 1, 2012, to pass-through $2.4 million in interest on the unamortized balance of the Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P40_S1	On June 26, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's methods and calculations and new rates became effective on July 3, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P41_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P41_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P41_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P42_S0	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P42_S1	The rate change passed through 11 months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over 11 months beginning February 1, 2013, including grant amortization pass-back of $34.6 million and interest pass-back of $23.8 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P42_S2	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.76%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P43_S0	On October 23, 2013, the Washington Commission approved an update on the Company's PCORC, effective November 1, 2013, which reflected decreases in the overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P43_S1	This resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of $10.5 million or 0.5% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P44_S0	On December 27, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P44_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $58.5 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P44_S2	Of the total credit, $37.8 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $20.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2013 rate period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P44_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.26%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P44_S4	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P45_S0	Natural Gas Rates PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P45_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P45_S2	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P46_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P46_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P46_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P47_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P47_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P47_S2	The Washington Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P47_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of $6.6 million, the difference being recognized as revenue sensitive taxes.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P48_S0	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P48_S1	The rates resulted in a decrease to the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P48_S2	On May 1, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the proposed rates and allowed them to be made permanent.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P48_S3	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is a decrease of $77.0 million, or 7.7% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P48_S4	The rate adjustment has no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P49_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff, effective on November 1, 2013, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P49_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is an increase of $4.0 million, or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P50_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's Pipeline Replacement Program Plan (PRPP) that would accelerate and enhance the safety of the natural gas system and ultimately reduce costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P50_S1	Under the PRPP plan, PSE would be allowed to file a tariff revision to recover its costs associated with the acceleration of the replacement of natural gas pipelines with the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P50_S2	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P51_S0	Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have a significant impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P52_S0	PSE's operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P52_S1	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P52_S2	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P52_S3	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P53_S0	PSE reported lower usage by its residential electric customers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to Pacific Northwest temperatures being warmer on average as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P53_S1	The actual average temperature during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 was 53.89 degrees, or 1.90 degrees warmer than the same period in the prior year, and 1.25 degrees warmer when compared to the historical average.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S0	While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's new decoupling mechanisms that went into effect on July 1, 2013 for electric and gas operations will greatly diminish the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to eliminate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S2	As a result, these electric and gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S3	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S4	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P54_S5	Following each calendar year, PSE will bill or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers during the following May to April time period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P55_S0	Effective January 1, 2014, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P55_S1	As a result, PSE will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns for these customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P56_S0	PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above the number of electric customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P56_S1	PSE also expects energy usage by both residential electric and natural gas customers to continue a long-term trend of slow decline primarily due to continued energy efficiency improvements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P57_S0	PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P57_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P57_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P57_S3	For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P57_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P58_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P58_S1	PSE's credit facilities expire in 2018 and Puget Energy's senior secured credit facility expires in 2017.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P58_S2	(See discussion on credit facilities in the section entitled Financing Program - Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper ).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P59_S0	PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P59_S1	These regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P59_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation byproducts such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P59_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates, and on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees in order to comply with these regulatory requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P59_S4	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change and generation by-products, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P60_S0	PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers currently do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier and therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P60_S1	However, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P60_S2	Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P60_S3	In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P60_S4	Further, PSE faces competition from towns or cities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers in its service territory.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P61_S0	As noted in PSE's IRP filed with the Washington Commission, PSE projects that beginning in 2017, its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P61_S1	The IRP identifies reductions in contractual supplies of energy and capacity available under certain long-term power purchase agreements, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P61_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P62_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, significantly increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P63_S0	PSE is investing in its utility infrastructure and customer service functions in order to meet regulatory requirements, serve customers energy needs and replace aging infrastructure.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P63_S1	These investments and operating requirements give rise to significant growth in depreciation, amortization and operating expenses, which are not recovered through the ratemaking process in a timely manner.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P64_S0	Operational Risks Associated With Generating Facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P65_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered, solar and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P66_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels, including facility shutdowns due to equipment and process failures or fuel supply interruptions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P66_S1	PSE does not have business interruption insurance coverage to cover replacement power costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P67_S0	PSE owns a 25% share of Colstrip Unit 4 coal fired plant in eastern Montana.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P67_S1	PSE's share of the unit's net maximum capacity is 185.0 MWs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S0	On July 1, 2013, Colstrip Unit 4 was tripped off-line.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S1	Upon inspection of the unit, significant damage was observed to the generator which required repairs to the stator, core and rotor.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S2	The unit was returned to service in February 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S3	PSE's share of the repair costs, which are capital expenditures, was $8.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S4	The repair costs for the plant are covered by insurance and are subject to PSE's share of the deductible of $0.6 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S5	In addition, power costs increased approximately $14.0 million in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P68_S6	The power costs are subject to the PCA mechanism sharing bands, of which PSE's share of the cost increase was $7.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P69_S0	Grant County PUD Purchase Power Contract.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P70_S0	On February 27, 2014, Grant County PUD discovered a sixty-five foot long, two inch wide crack in a spillway pier at its Wanapum Development Project.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P71_S0	PSE is party to a purchased power contract with Grant County PUD, pursuant to which PSE takes 0.8% of the output from the project and pays a proportional share of the operating cost of the project.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P71_S1	Grant County PUD has lowered the reservoir level 26 feet below normal for the foreseeable future which also impacts the operations of Chelan County PUD Rock Island Project which is upstream from Wanapum Development Project.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P72_S0	An engineering assessment of the crack repairs and water flow protocols are in the early stages of development and it is not possible to predict crack repair nor replacement power costs, if any, at this time.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P72_S1	Any additional power cost increases are subject to the Company s PCA mechanism sharing bands.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Company is actively engaged in monitoring the development of the commercial markets for such intangible power attributes as Renewable Energy Credit (REC)s and carbon financial instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company supports the development of regional and national markets for these products that are open, transparent and liquid.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P74_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P74_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P74_S2	Set forth below are the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 :
1085392_14_ITEM7_P75_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P76_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P77_S0	The presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P78_S0	Electric margin and gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P78_S1	PSE s electric margin and gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and gas margin measures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P78_S2	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P79_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2012 to 2013 and periods 2011 to 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P80_S0	Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P81_S0	______________ As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P82_S0	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P82_S1	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P83_S0	Electric margin increased $60.2 million and $127.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P83_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact electric operating revenue and electric energy costs which are included in electric margin:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P84_S0	2013 compared to 2012 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $28.7 million , or 1.3% , to $2,156.9 million from $2,128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P84_S1	Operating revenue increased $28.7 million primarily due to higher sales to other utilities and marketers of $30.7 million and higher miscellaneous other operating revenue of $23.4 million offset by decoupling revenue over-collection of $15.0 million and lower electric retail sales of $9.4 million .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P84_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S0	Electric retail sales decreased $9.4 million , or 0.4% , to $2,091.0 million from $2,100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S1	Electric retail sales decreased due to a net revenue decrease of $16.4 million primarily due to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff which passes through to customers the benefits of federal income tax incentives with no impact on earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S2	The offset is recorded in amortization expense and federal tax expense.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S3	The rate decrease was offset by the electric rate increase of 3.2% effective May 14, 2012, the expedited rate filing and the decoupling rate increase of 2.5% which became effective July 1, 2013 and various other pass-through tariff items that have no impact on earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S4	The decrease was offset by a net revenue increase of $6.9 million due to higher retail electricity usage of 69,719 MWhs, or 0.3%, primarily due to higher usage by its commercial and industrial electric customers for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S5	Sales to other utilities and marketers increased $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S6	The increase was primarily due to an increase in wholesale electricity prices which increased revenue by $25.7 million and an increase in sales volume of 297,973 MWhs, or 21.4% which increased revenue $5.1 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S7	Decoupling revenue resulted in an over-collection of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to higher volumetric revenues over the decoupled revenues per customer under the decoupling mechanism effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P85_S8	The offset is recorded in regulatory liability which will be passed back to customers through a rate filing beginning May 1, 2014 over a 12-month period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P86_S0	Other electric operating revenue increased $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P86_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , other electric operating revenues increased primarily due to lower losses on non-core gas sales of $16.0 million and higher transmission revenue of $7.1 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P87_S0	Electric Energy Costs Purchased electricity expense decreased $80.4 million , or 12.9% , for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P87_S1	The decrease in purchased electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily the result of a $102.4 million decrease in long-term firm purchases and market purchases.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P87_S2	This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $9.4 million due to a market price offset and increase of $7.7 million in transmission expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P88_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P88_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P88_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P89_S0	Electric generation fuel expense increased $56.4 million , or 27.5% , for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P89_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $48.3 million increase in fuel expense at PSE's combustion turbine facilities primarily resulting from an increase in electric generation at combustion turbine facilities of 2,735,066 MWhs, or 104.4%, as compared to the same period in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P89_S2	Also contributing to the increase was a $9.8 million increase in fuel expense at PSE's Colstrip Unit 1 2 primarily due to the two plants which were taken offline in 2012 for maintenance for an extended period and reintroduced into production when it was more economical to generate energy at a later point in time.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P89_S3	The increase was offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in fuel expense at Colstrip Unit 3 4 primarily due to Unit 4, which was shut down for repair and maintenance starting July 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P89_S4	Unit 4 returned to service in February 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P90_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $7.5 million , or 10.2% , for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 as a result of lower electric residential and farm customer sales volumes associated with the BPA REP.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P91_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P92_S0	2012 compared to 2011 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues decreased $19.0 million, or 0.9%, to $2,128.2 million from $2,147.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P92_S1	Operating revenue decreased $19.0 million primarily due to lower electric retail sales of $23.5 million and lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $22.0 million offset by higher miscellaneous other operating revenue of $27.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P92_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P93_S0	Electric retail sales decreased $23.5 million, or 1.1%, to $2,100.4 million from $2,123.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P93_S1	Electric retail sales decreased due to a $35.3 million decrease in retail electricity usage of 357,640 MWhs, or 1.7%, primarily due to warmer temperatures in PSE s service territory during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P93_S2	The actual average temperature during the year ended December 31, 2012 was 52.0 degrees, or 1.3 degrees warmer than the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S0	when compared to the historical average.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S1	Partially offsetting the decrease was an $11.8 million net increase in retail sales due to the electric rate increase effective May 14, 2012 and various pass-through tariff items that have no impact to earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S2	The net increase included tariff items, such as the suspension of REC credits in 2011 which contributed an increase of $14.8 million in electric retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S3	The REC credit to customers is offset in other electric operating revenue with no impact to earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S4	PSE's customers received credits effective November 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S5	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S6	The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales volume of 421,394 MWhs, or 23.3% which decreased revenue $10.6 million and a decline in wholesale electricity prices which decreased revenue by $11.4 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S7	Other electric operating revenue increased $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S8	For the year ended December 31, 2012, other electric operating revenues increased primarily due to lower losses on non-core gas sales of $37.1 million and a reduction to revenue offsets which contributed increases of $80.3 million in revenue related to PTCs, which are deferred until PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P94_S9	Partially offsetting the increase is a decrease in REC revenue of $93.5 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P95_S0	As discussed above, REC revenue is an offset of the REC credit provided to PSE s customers in electric retail sales with no impact to earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P96_S0	Electric Energy Costs Purchased electricity expense decreased $149.7 million, or 19.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P96_S1	The decrease in purchased electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily the result of a decrease of $182.6 million related to the expiration of long-term firm purchase contracts that were replaced with market price power and wind generation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P96_S2	In addition, a decrease of $6.2 million was due to a decrease in the overrecovery of power costs, which is shared with customers in accordance with the PCA mechanism, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P96_S3	Partially offsetting this decrease was a $25.1 million increase related to energy purchase agreements and $8.4 million in additional costs recognized in order to offset the deferral of variable costs related to the Lower Snake River project prior to the inclusion of the plant in rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P97_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P97_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P97_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S0	Electric generation fuel expense increased $5.5 million, or 2.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S1	The increase was primarily due to increased generation from PSE's combustion turbine facilities due to the decrease in hydroelectric and wind generation of 904,423 MWhs, or 11.9%, and the decrease in electric generation at the Colstrip facility of 401,059 MWhs, or 9.5% as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S2	As a result of lower wholesale gas prices it was more economical to generate gas fired electricity from PSE's combustion turbine facilities resulting in an increase in natural gas costs of $8.2 million as compared to the same period in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S3	Offsetting the increase was $2.7 million decrease due to the reduction in Colstrip facility's generation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S4	The decrease in electric generation at the Colstrip facility was primarily due to two coal plants that were taken offline for maintenance and reintroduced at a later point in time into production as other sources of electric generation were considered more economical.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P98_S5	Residential exchange credits decreased $2.4 million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011 as a result of lower electric residential and farm customer sales volumes associated with the BPA REP.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P99_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P100_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s natural gas margin changes from 2012 to 2013 and 2011 to 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P101_S0	Gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P102_S0	___________________ As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P102_S1	Gas margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operations and maintenance expense.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P102_S2	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P103_S0	Natural gas margin decreased $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and increased $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P103_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact gas operating revenue and gas energy costs which are included in natural gas margin:

1085392_14_ITEM7_P134_S4	The new credit facilities also have an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P134_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , one letter of credit totaling $3.0 million in support of contracts was outstanding under the facility, and $162.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P134_S6	A $1.0 million letter of credit was issued under PSE's $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P134_S7	PSE s $3.0 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and $1.0 million letter of credit in support of energy hedging are considered to be outside of the credit agreement.

1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	_____________ As of December 31, 2013 , PSE had credit facilities totaling $1.0 billion and no amount had been drawn.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	These facilities consisted of $650.0 million to fund operating expenses and $350.0 million to support electric and natural gas hedging.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S2	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S3	The new credit facilities also have an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion.

1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S5	A $1.0 million letter of credit was issued under PSE's $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P138_S6	PSE s $3.0 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and $1.0 million letter of credit in support of energy hedging are considered to be outside of the credit agreement.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $30.0 million of which $ 29.6 million was drawn.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy had incurred a $299.0 million draw under its $800.0 million Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	The Puget Energy revolving credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P139_S3	All other terms and conditions of that facility remain unchanged.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	Utility Construction Program PSE s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system and the natural gas and electric distribution systems are designed to meet regulatory requirements and customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $567.9 million in 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P140_S2	Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that exceeds its cash flow from operations.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P142_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	Puget Sound Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $37.8 million from $797.9 million to $835.7 million during 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P143_S1	The increase in cash flow was primarily the result of the following increases:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	An increase related to other long term liabilities of $76.2 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	In 2013 , there was approximately $9.5 million of storm costs compared to $71.5 million of cash outflow for costs related to the January 2012 winter storm which increased cashflow.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	An increase related to regulatory liabilities of $36.0 million, primarily due to over collection of the decoupling mechanism and renewable gas sales.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	The increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2013 described above was primarily offset by cash decreases of $120.7 million reduction in cash collections and a $33.3 million decrease in gas purchase adjustment.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	In addition, non cash items increased approximately $36.1 million related to the fair value adjustment of derivative instruments and deferred income taxes; this was partially offset by a decrease in items such as depreciation and amortization, of approximately $13.1 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S2	Puget Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $765.9 million, a decrease of $16.8 million from the $782.7 million generated during the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S3	The net decrease was offset by a $37.8 million increase from the cash provided by the operating activities of PSE as previously discussed.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S4	As a result of the merger with Puget Holdings in February 2009, $34.2 million in derivative settlement payments were reclassified to financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to $92.7 million during the same period in 2012 , resulting in a decrease in operating cash flows of $58.4 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S5	This decrease was due to a decline in the number of contracts settled during 2013 as compared to the prior period.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P147_S6	These contracts represent proceeds received from derivative instruments that included financing elements at the merger date.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	Financing Program The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P148_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , PSE had $162.0 million and $181.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S3	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S4	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2013 and 2012 was 3.93% , and 6.49% , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P149_S5	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE entered into two new unsecured revolving credit facilities and terminated its previous three credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S1	The new credit facilities provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S2	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S3	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S4	The new credit facilities also have an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S5	The credit agreements for these two replacement credit facilities contain similar terms and conditions and are syndicated among numerous lenders and mature in February 2018.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S6	The credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S7	The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S8	PSE certifies its compliance with such covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P150_S9	As of December 31, 2013, PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenants as noted above.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P151_S1	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P151_S2	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P151_S3	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P151_S4	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.25% and the commitment fee is 0.175%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	As of December 31, 2013, no amount was drawn and outstanding under PSE s $650.0 million liquidity facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	One letter of credit in the amount of $3.0 million in support of contracts was outstanding under the facility, and $162.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P152_S2	One letter of credit in the amount of $1.0 million was outstanding under the $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P153_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P153_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P153_S3	At December 31, 2013 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $29.6 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P153_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	At December 31, 2013, Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million five-year revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the bank s approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	The five-year revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P155_S1	The agreement also contains two financial covenants based on the following ratios: Group Funds From Operations (FFO) Coverage Ratio and Maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P155_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants as noted above.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	Interest rates may be based on the bank's prime rate or LIBOR, plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P157_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , $ 299.0 million was drawn and outstanding under the facility, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.30%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility (see Note 7 and the "Interest Rate Risk" section in Item 3).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	At December 31, 2013 , approximately $469.6 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.4% at December 31, 2013 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.4 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S6	At December 31, 2013 , the EBITDA to interest expense was 2.9 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P160_S7	At December 31, 2013 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	Debt Restrictive Covenants The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P161_S2	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2013 , PSE could issue:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Approximately $319.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $531.7 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	At December 31, 2013 , PSE had approximately $6.9 billion in electric and natural gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	Upon approval of the merger in 2009, the Company was required to refinance its debt in place at the time of the merger.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P163_S1	The Company has met this refinancing requirement as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	Shelf Registrations and Long-Term Debt Activity Puget Sound Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S1	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, up to $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by pledged first mortgage bonds.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S2	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S3	On May 23, 2013, PSE refinanced $161.9 million of its Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds to a lower weighted average interest rate from 5.01% to 3.91%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S4	The bonds will mature on March 1, 2031.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P164_S5	On or after March 1, 2023, the Company may elect to call the bonds at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, without premium, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	And Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P166_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P167_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P167_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P167_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P168_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, PSE's electric and gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P168_S1	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P168_S2	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P169_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P170_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2013 in the amount of $895.7 million and $697.5 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2012 of $936.2 million and $628.9 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P172_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Electric Regulation and Rates within Item 1.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	Business Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P178_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P182_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P182_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S2	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $4.3 billion at the October 1, 2013 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S3	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.5 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 21.0% or $743.0 million.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S4	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S5	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 2.7% and 7.0%, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P184_S6	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P185_S2	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the NPNS exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P186_S1	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	On July 1, 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P189_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P190_S1	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P190_S2	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P191_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P191_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P193_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P193_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P194_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P194_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P195_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P195_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P195_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P195_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P196_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P196_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P196_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P197_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P197_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $22.4 million , $14.8 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P197_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 60.8%, 57.2% and 61.0% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P197_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $16.5 million and 9.3 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P197_S4	In 2014 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $14.0 million and incremental qualified pension income of $12.6 million, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $5.7 million , $5.0 million and $5.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.7 million and $1.0 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S3	In 2014 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $4.9 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S4	PSE has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S5	PSE recognized expense of $0.1 million , $0.3 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S6	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.3 million and $0.2 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S7	In 2014 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.3 million and incremental expense of $0.3 million, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S8	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P198_S9	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S4	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S5	During 2013 , the Company made a cash contribution of $20.4 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P199_S6	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P200_S0	2013 and 2012 , the Company s qualified pension plan was $42.4 million over-funded and $85.1 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 107.4% and 86.2% funded respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P200_S1	As of January 1, 2014 , the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P200_S2	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2014 are expected to be at least $12.0 million , $4.0 million and $0.4 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7_P201_S0	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations increased from 4.15% in 2012 to 5.10% in 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P201_S1	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 4.75% in 2012 to 4.15% in 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P201_S2	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2013 remained unchanged at 2012 level, or 7.75% .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P201_S3	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits decreased from 7.50% in 2012 to 6.90% in 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7_P202_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_14_ITEM7_P203_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE is focused on the commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios and related effects noted above.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P1_S4	The objectives of the hedging strategy are to:
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Meet the credit, liquidity, financing, tax and accounting requirements of PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	ASC 815 requires a significant amount of disclosure regarding PSE s derivative activities and the nature of their impact on PSE s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The information in this Item 7A should serve as an accompaniment to Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S2	PSE s natural gas retail customers are served by natural gas purchase contracts which expose PSE s customers to commodity price risks through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S3	All purchased natural gas costs are recovered through customer rates with no direct impact on PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	PSE s energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The forward physical electric contracts are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable with investment grade counterparties that do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	On July 1, 2009, the Company elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P7_S4	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments that do not meet the NPNS exception:
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings and OCI (for cash flow hedges), see Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Company had total assets of $8.1 million and total liabilities of $35.7 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of natural gas to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	All fair value adjustments of derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with ASC 980, "Regulated Operations", due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S2	All increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S4	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $43.1 million , with an after-tax impact of $28.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P10_S5	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2013 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2013 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P12_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P14_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE held approximately $1.1 billion in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees, and had 20 counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 67.0% of PSE s energy and natural gas portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies while 33.0% are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S3	PSE assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S4	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S5	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: (1) WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts; (2) International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and (3) North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P16_S6	PSE believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P17_S0	changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Counterparty credit risk impacts PSE s decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P18_S1	A counterparty may have a deterioration of credit below investment grade, potentially indicating that it is no longer probable that it will fulfill its obligations under a contract (e.g., make a physical delivery upon the contract's maturity).
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P19_S0	ASC 815 specifies the requirements for derivative contracts to qualify for the NPNS scope exception.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P20_S0	When performance is no longer probable, PSE records the fair value of the contract on the balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded in the statements of income.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P21_S0	Accumulated OCI of the cash flow hedge is also impacted by a counterparty s deterioration of credit under ASC 815 guidelines.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P21_S1	If a forecasted transaction associated with the cash flow hedge is probable of not occurring, PSE will reclassify the amounts deferred in accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P21_S2	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P21_S3	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P22_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P23_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA or NAESB).
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P23_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P23_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P24_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P24_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P24_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P25_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P25_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P25_S2	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P25_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P26_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P26_S1	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P27_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P27_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P27_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P27_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P27_S4	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's debt instruments:
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P28_S0	For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Notes 6 and 10 under Item 8.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P29_S0	From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P29_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2013 was a net loss of $6.3 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P29_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $6.6 million in OCI as of December 31, 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P30_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P30_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P30_S2	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P30_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S0	which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S1	During 2013 , Puget Energy reclassified $0.7 million in losses from accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S2	This was the result of paying down $135.0 million on Puget Energy's revolving senior secured credit facility, which caused the related forecasted transactions (i.e., future interest payments associated with the debt pay down) to become remote of occurring.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S3	At December 31, 2013 , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $13.2 million pre-tax loss.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S4	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P31_S5	The ending balance in OCI includes a loss of $0.14 million pre-tax, and $0.09 million after tax, related to the interest rate swaps previously designated as cash flow hedge.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P32_S0	Currently, all changes in market value are recorded in earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM7A_P32_S1	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of Puget Energy's interest rate swaps by $1.1 million .

1085392_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P35_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	Costs related to planned major maintenance, in excess of $0.5 million , are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major maintenance.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P37_S2	This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	Non-Utility Property, Plant and Equipment For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P38_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	Goodwill On February 6, 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P42_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P43_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2013 using an October 1, 2013 measurement date.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P49_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P49_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	Changes in these estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P50_S4	There were no events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2013 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P51_S1	The cash and cash equivalents balance at Puget Energy was $44.3 million and $135.5 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P51_S2	The 2013 and 2012 balance consisted of cash equivalents, which are reported at cost and approximate fair value, and were $2.6 million and $107.6 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P52_S1	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	Fuel and Gas Inventory Fuel and gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P53_S2	Gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P53_S3	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P54_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P54_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term assets or liabilities due to the length of the amortization.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	The exception is the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) which can be a current asset or current liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending principally upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P58_S2	The AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility plant additions based on the effective dates are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P59_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P59_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	Non-utility subsidiaries recognize revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	Sales of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $243.9 million , $244.2 million and $252.5 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operating revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, PSE's electric and gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	Revenues associated with power costs under the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $7.4 million and $9.9 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	Self-Insurance PSE currently has no insurance coverage for storm damage and recent environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	PSE is self-insured for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P67_S3	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P68_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P69_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE provides natural gas to its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P70_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P70_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P71_S1	Prior to July 1, 2010, PSE passed the benefit of the PTCs to customers as the benefits were generated.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P71_S2	After July 1, 2010, PSE records the benefit of the PTCs as a regulatory liability until such time as PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P71_S3	Once utilized, PSE will pass the benefit to customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting in 2009.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P74_S3	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P74_S4	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P77_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 Fair Value Measurements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Statements of Cash Flows The Company has refinancing transactions that do not result in an actual exchange of cash.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P80_S1	For these transactions, the Company evaluates if the non-exchange of cash is for convenience purposes and if so, the Company considers the transaction as if it had constructively received and disbursed the cash and presents the transaction as gross on the financing section of the statements of cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	PSE funds cash dividends to pay the shareholder of Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S1	The following non-cash investing and financing activities have occurred at the Company: The Company revised its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows due to an immaterial error.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S2	Revisions were made in the second quarter ended June 30, 2013 on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to reflect energy efficiency expenditures as operating cash outflows instead of investing cash outflows.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S3	The Company determined energy efficiency expenditures should have been classified as operating activities instead of investing activities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S4	These revisions decreased net cash provided by operating activities and decreased net cash used by investing activities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S5	The revision does not affect the net change in cash and cash equivalents for any of the periods, and has no effect on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance Sheets, and Consolidated Statement of Common Shareholder's Equity.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S6	The Company has evaluated the effects of these errors and concluded that none of them are material to any of the Company's previously issued quarterly or annual Financial Statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P81_S7	Nevertheless, the Company has elected to revise the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in this report to correct for the effect of these errors and properly reflect the revised values.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	The amounts on prior period Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows that have been revised are summarized below:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The following tables set forth the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	Balance Sheet In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210) (ASU 2011-11).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	ASU 2011-11, as amended by ASU 2013-01, Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, enhances disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity's right to offset and related arrangements associated with its derivative instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	ASU 2011-11 requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S3	ASU 2011-11, as amended, is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S4	Retrospective application of the disclosures is required for all periods presented within the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P84_S5	These disclosure requirements are the only impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) requirements as disclosed in Note 9 - Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02), to improve the transparency of reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P86_S2	ASU 2013-02 also requires an entity to cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P86_S3	This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account instead of directly to income or expense.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	ASU 2013-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012, for public companies and is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, for private companies.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	Other than additional disclosures or a change in the presentation on the statement of comprehensive income when necessary, ASU 2013-02 does not impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	The Company adopted the ASU requirements as disclosed in Note 18 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	Below is a chart with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and the associated time periods:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 included the following:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Commission rate proceeding.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P90_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805 as a result of the merger.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P92_S2	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $269.5 million and $239.2 million in 2013 and 2012 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P92_S3	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	The Washington Commission issued a general rate case order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	In 2013 and 2012 , PSE incurred $9.5 million and $71.5 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which no amount was deferred in 2013 and $60.4 million was deferred in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), a limited-scope proceeding, was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P94_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six -month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11 -month timeline for a general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	On October 23, 2013, the Washington Commission approved an update on the Company's PCORC, effective November 1, 2013, which reflected decreases in the overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P95_S1	This resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of $10.5 million or 0.5% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	Electric Rate Case On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism and expedited rate filing (ERF) tariff filings, effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the decoupling mechanism for electric is an increase of $21.4 million , or 1.0% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the ERF filings for electric is an increase of $30.7 million , or 1.5% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S3	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.77% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S4	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P96_S5	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P97_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P97_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter are scheduled for May 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's electric general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S1	The rate increases for electric customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S3	PSE's requested treatment of the prepayments made to Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), filed in May 2010, was approved in the order.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S4	The final order rejected PSE's proposed conservation savings adjustment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P98_S5	Finally, a new rate rider for RECs was proposed by settlement of electric parties and approved by the Washington Commission in the final order.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	The following table sets forth electric rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	In addition, PSE will be increasing the allowed delivery revenue per customer under the ERF filing by 3.0% for electric customers on January 1 of each year until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	Accounting Orders and Petitions On November 27, 2013, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing PSE to provide the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas supply produced from a landfill-gas recovery project in King County (Biogas) prior to October 31, 2013 as a bill credit to customers over a one-year period in its Renewable Energy Credits adjusting price schedule which became effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	Additionally, the Washington Commission order authorized that all net proceeds from Biogas produced after October 31, 2013 plus the internal labor needed to obtain the net proceeds is reflected as a PSE below-the-line item (i.e., not included in the revenues and expenses considered when setting electric customer rates) and excluded from utility operations.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	PSE completed the sale of its electric infrastructure assets located in Jefferson County and the transition of electrical services in the county to Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) on March 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	The proceeds from the sale exceeded the transferred assets' net carrying value of $46.7 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $60.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	In its 2010 order on the subject, the Washington Commission stated that PSE must file an accounting and ratemaking petition with the Washington Commission to determine how this gain will be allocated between customers and shareholders.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S3	As a result, the gain was deferred and recorded as a regulatory liability until the Washington Commission determines the accounting and ratemaking treatment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S4	On October 31, 2013, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that authorizes PSE to retain the gain of $45.0 million and return $15.0 million to its remaining customers over a period of 48 months.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S5	Intervenors testimony is scheduled to be filed in March, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S6	For federal income tax purposes, the Company will elect to treat the transaction as an involuntary conversion under the Internal Revenue Code which allows for deferral of the tax gain if PSE acquires qualified replacement property by December 31, 2015.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P102_S7	Based on PSE's current construction program projection, it anticipates meeting this requirement through such purchases by that date.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	PCA Mechanism In 2002, the Washington Commission approved a PCA mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity vary from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P103_S1	All significant variable power supply cost variables (hydroelectric and wind generation, market price for purchased power and surplus power, natural gas and coal fuel price, generation unit forced outage risk and transmission cost) are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a calendar year basis, between PSE and its customers on a graduated scale.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	Treasury Grant Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (Section 1603) authorizes the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) to make grants (Treasury Grants) to taxpayers who place specified energy property in service provided certain conditions are met.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P105_S1	Section 1603 precludes a recipient from claiming PTCs on property for which a grant is claimed.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	The rate schedule passed-through $5.5 million of the $28.7 million Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant in 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P108_S2	The order authorized PSE to pass back one-tenth of the Treasury Grant on an annual basis and included 23 months of Treasury Grant amortization to customers from February 2010 through December 2011, which represented the month the Treasury Grant funds were received through the end of the period over which the rates will be set.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P108_S3	This represents an overall average rate reduction of 0.3% , with no impact to net income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	On February 29, 2012, PSE filed proposed tariff revisions, with stated effective dates of April 1, 2012, and subsequently revised by filing on March 29, 2012 with stated effective dates of June 1, 2012, to pass-through $2.4 million in interest on the unamortized balance of the Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	On June 26, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's methods and calculations and new rates became effective on July 3, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S2	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S3	The rate change passed through 11 months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over 11 months beginning February 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S4	Of the total credit, $34.6 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $23.8 million represents the pass through of interest.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P109_S5	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.76% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	On December 27, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $58.5 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P110_S2	Of the total credit, $37.8 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $20.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2013 rate period.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P110_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.26% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	Gas Regulation and Rates Gas General Rate Cases and Other Filings Affecting Rates On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for natural gas customers of $13.4 million or 1.3% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P111_S1	The rate increases for natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P111_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P112_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of $6.6 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism and ERF tariff filings, effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	$10.8 million , or 1.1% annually.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the ERF filings for natural gas is a decrease of $2.0 million , or a decrease of 0.2% annually.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a series of settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P115_S1	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P115_S2	As a result, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism and will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P116_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P116_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter are scheduled for May 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S3	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S4	The rates resulted in a decrease to the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S5	On May 1, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the proposed rates and allowed them to be made permanent.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P117_S6	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is a decrease of $77.0 million , or 7.7% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff, effective on November 1, 2013, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is an increase of $4.0 million , or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P118_S2	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	In addition, PSE will be increasing the allowed delivery revenue per customer under the ERF filing by 2.2% for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P120_S1	The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P121_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	Per the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and adjusts loss reserves quarterly.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs ranging from $31.3 million to $49.5 million for gas and from $9.1 million to $27.4 million for electric.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company does not consider any amounts within those ranges as being a better estimate and has therefore accrued $31.3 million and $9.1 million for gas and electric, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P126_S2	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P128_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P128_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one .

1085392_14_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2013 due to:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P132_S0	a legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P133_S0	an obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P144_S0	At the time of the merger in February 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five -year term-loan and a $1.0 billion five-year capital expenditure credit facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P144_S1	On February 10, 2012, Puget Energy entered into a $1.0 billion five -year revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P144_S2	Concurrent with the closing of the new PSE credit facilities in February 2013, the Company reduced the size of Puget Energy's credit facility to $800.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P144_S3	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P144_S4	All other terms and conditions of that facility remain unchanged from when it was committed in 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P145_S0	As a revolving facility, amounts borrowed may be repaid without a reduction in the size of the facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P145_S1	Initial borrowings under this facility were used to repay debt outstanding under the term loan and capital expenditure credit facility and those agreements were terminated.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P146_S0	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P146_S1	The agreement also contains two financial covenants based on the following ratios: Group Funds From Operations (FFO) Coverage Ratio and Maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P147_S0	The principal amounts of long-term debt maturities for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P148_S0	Financial Covenants Puget Energy's credit facility contains financial covenants related to group FFO coverage and maximum leverage.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company is in compliance with its long-term debt financial covenants.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P149_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P149_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2013 and 2012 was 3.93% and 6.49% , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P149_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE entered into two new credit facilities and terminated its previous three credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	The new credit facilities provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S2	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S3	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S4	The new credit facilities also have an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S5	The credit agreements for these two replacement credit facilities contain similar terms and conditions, are syndicated among numerous lenders and mature in February 2018.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P150_S6	The credit agreements contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, that among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, issue equity, pay dividends, transact with affiliates and make asset dispositions and investments.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P151_S2	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P151_S3	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P151_S7	A letter of credit in the amount of $1.0 million was outstanding under the $350.0 million facility supporting energy hedging.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	Demand Promissory Note On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P152_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P152_S3	At December 31, 2013 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $29.6 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P152_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P153_S0	At December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million five -year revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	The five -year revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P154_S1	The agreement also contains two financial covenants based on the following ratios: Group Funds From Operations (FFO) Coverage Ratio and Maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P154_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P155_S1	Interest rates may be based on the prime rate or LIBOR, plus a spread based on Puget Energy s credit ratings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P156_S1	At December 31, 2013 , $299.0 million was drawn and outstanding under the facility, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.30% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	Certain leases contain purchase options, renewal options and escalation provisions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P158_S2	Operating lease expenses net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	Payments received for the subleases of properties were immaterial for each of the years ended 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts are:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P160_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P160_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P161_S2	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P161_S3	The forward physical electric agreements are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable with investment grade counterparties that do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P162_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P163_S2	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P163_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding which extend to January 2017 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P163_S4	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	The following table presents the volumes, fair values and locations of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	___________ Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	Interest rate swap contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P166_S1	PSE had a net derivative liability and an offsetting regulatory asset of $27.6 million at December 31, 2013 and $96.0 million at December 31, 2012 related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P166_S2	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 10.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	ASU 2013-01 requires disclosure of both gross and net information for recognized derivative assets and liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P168_S1	It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level, without offsetting assets or liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P168_S2	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P168_S3	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	The following tables present the potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative assets and liabilities:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	All Derivative Contract deals are executed under ISDA, NAESB and WSPP Master Netting Agreements with Right of Offset.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	Interest Rate Swap Contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	Due to the merger in 2009, Puget Energy recorded all derivative contracts at fair value as either assets or liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P172_S1	Certain contracts meeting the criteria defined in ASC 815 were subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges, thereby causing differences in the derivative unrealized gains/losses to be recorded through earnings between Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P172_S2	These differences will occur through February 2015.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following tables present the effect and locations of the Company's derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, recorded on the statements of income:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	The unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts is reported in the statement of cash flows under the operating activities section.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P174_S1	However, at the time of the merger in 2009, all derivative contracts at Puget Energy were assessed to identify contracts that have a more than an insignificant fair value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P174_S2	If the fair value was greater than 10% of the notional value, the contract was deemed as having a financing element.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P174_S3	For those contracts, the cash inflows (outflows) are presented in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P174_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , cash outflows related to financing activities of $34.3 million , $92.7 million and $182.7 million , respectively, were reported on Puget Energy's statement of cash flows.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	For derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges (including both commodity and interest rate swap contracts), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was recorded as a component of OCI, and then is reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P175_S1	During 2013 , Puget Energy reclassified $0.7 million in losses from accumulated OCI into earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P175_S2	This was the result of paying down $135.0 million on Puget Energy's revolving senior secured credit facility, thus causing the related forecasted transactions (i.e., future interest payments associated with the debt pay down) to become remote of occurring.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P175_S3	Puget Energy and PSE expect $0.7 million and $2.1 million of losses, respectively, in accumulated OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P175_S4	The Company does not attempt cash flow hedging for any new transactions and records all mark-to-market adjustments through earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	The following tables present the Company's pre-tax gain (loss) on derivatives that were previously in a cash flow hedge relationship, and subsequently reclassified out of accumulated OCI into income:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P178_S2	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial distress.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P178_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P178_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P179_S2	However, as of December 31, 2013 , approximately 99.9% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 0.1% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P179_S3	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P179_S4	As the Company generally enters into transactions using the WSPP, ISDA and NAESB master agreements, it believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because they provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments and, in the event of counterparty default, termination payments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA, or NAESB).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P180_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P180_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P180_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P181_S1	The default tenor is used by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P181_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P182_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	Credit reserves are recorded as contra accounts to unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P183_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the quarter.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company's derivative activity at December 31, 2013 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P187_S0	__________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P187_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P188_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P188_S1	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in the forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P189_S0	ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P189_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P189_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P190_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P190_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P190_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P191_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P192_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P192_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P193_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P194_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P194_S1	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P195_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P195_S2	Inputs used to estimate the fair value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and discount factors.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P195_S3	Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P196_S0	Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	For interest rate swaps, the Company obtains monthly mark-to-market values from an independent external pricing service for LIBOR forward rates, which is a significant input.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P197_S2	Some of the inputs of the interest rate swap valuations, which are less significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties, assumptions for time value and the impact of the Company's nonperformance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash as Level 1 financial instruments due to cash being at stated value, and cash equivalents at quoted market prices.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company considers its electric, natural gas and interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P199_S1	Management's assessment was based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P200_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices (e.g., Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P200_S1	However, certain energy derivative instruments with maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P201_S0	The following table presents the carrying value for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable and short-term debt by level, within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	The carrying values below are representative of fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	Carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	_______________ Income Statement location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P204_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $(13.4) million , $(15.2) million , and $(55.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P204_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P205_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P205_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P206_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P206_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P207_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P207_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P207_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P207_S3	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P208_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P208_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P208_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P209_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P209_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P209_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's purchased commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2013 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P210_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P211_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P211_S1	Consequently significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P212_S0	prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P212_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P213_S0	At December 31, 2013 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $7.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P214_S0	At the time of merger, Puget Energy recorded the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P214_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P214_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P215_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P216_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P216_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P217_S0	At June 30, 2013 , Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test of its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P217_S1	The valuation indicated a fair value of $484.1 million with an impairment to the Priest Rapids Reasonable Portion intangible asset contract.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P217_S2	As of June 30, 2013 , the carrying value for this intangible asset contract was $47.1 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be an asset of $33.6 million , thereby requiring a write-down of $13.5 million to the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P218_S0	The valuation was measured using the income approach.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P218_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract pricing which provided future net cash flow estimates which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P218_S2	A less significant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P218_S3	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the long-term power purchase contracts' fair value of $484.1 million on June 30, 2013 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P219_S0	During 2012 , Puget Energy completed valuation and impairment testing of its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P219_S1	At March 31, 2012 , the Wells Hydro intangible asset contract had a carrying value of $113.3 million and a fair value on a discounted basis of $96.7 million , thereby requiring a write-down of $16.6 million of this intangible asset and a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P219_S2	Additionally, at December 31, 2012 , the Rock Island intangible asset contract had a carrying value of $7.6 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be a liability of $10.2 million , thereby requiring a complete write-off of this intangible asset and a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P220_S0	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the long-term power purchase contracts' fair value on March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company's existing plan is a qualified employee Investment Plan 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P221_S1	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6% of plan compensation, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P221_S2	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55% of an employee s contribution up to 6% of plan compensation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P221_S3	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $14.6 million , $14.5 million and $13.5 million for the years 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P222_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P223_S0	Beginning January 1, 2014 employees hired as of this date will have access to the 401(k) plan and will choose how they want to accumulate funds for retirement, with two contribution sources from PSE:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P224_S0	401(k) Company Matching: new non-represented and United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) employees will receive company match each paycheck based on a new schedule- 100% match on the first 3% of pay contributed and 50% match on the next 3% of pay contributed.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P224_S1	An employee who contributes 6% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P224_S2	Company matching will be immediately vested.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P225_S0	Company Contribution: 401(k) or pension plan.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P225_S1	New non-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or an account in PSE s Retirement Plan (Cash Balance pension plan).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P225_S2	New employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance pension plan.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P225_S3	The Company s 4% contribution will vest after three years of employment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P226_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all PSE employees.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P226_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary, years of service and, in the case of employees in the cash balance formula plan, the applicable annual interest crediting rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P226_S2	Beginning January 1, 2014, all new UA employees and those new non-represented employees who elect to accumulate the Company contribution in the Cash Balance pension, will receive annual pay credits of 4% each year.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P226_S3	They will also receive interest credits like other participants in the Cash Balance pension, which are at least 1% per quarter.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P227_S0	When a newly-hired employee with a vested Cash Balance benefit leaves PSE, he or she will have annuity and lump sum options for distribution, with annuities calculated according to the Pension Protection Act.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P227_S1	Those who select the lump sum option will receive their current cash balance amount.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S0	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides group health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S1	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S2	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S3	The insurance premiums, paid primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S4	The 2009 merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings triggered a new basis of accounting for PSE s retirement benefit plans in the Puget Energy consolidated financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S5	Such purchase accounting adjustments associated with the remeasurement of the retirement plans are recorded at Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P228_S6	The following tables summarize the Company s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets and amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P229_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's pension benefit amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 :

1085392_14_ITEM8_P231_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and Puget Sound Energy's benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S0	The estimated prior service cost/(credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 by Puget Energy is $2.0 million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S1	The estimated net (loss)/gain for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 is $(0.9) million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S2	The estimated prior service cost/(credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 is immaterial .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S3	The estimated net (loss)/gain, prior service cost/(credit) and transition/(obligation) asset for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 are immaterial.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S4	The estimated net (loss)/gain and prior service cost/(credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 by Puget Sound Energy are $(13.0) million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S5	The estimated net loss/(gain) and prior service cost/(credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 are $(1.5) million .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S6	The estimated prior service cost/(credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 is immaterial .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S7	The estimated net (loss)/gain for the other postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2014 is $0.6 million and prior service cost/(credit) and transition (obligation)/asset for the other postretirement plans are immaterial.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P232_S8	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2014 are expected to be at least $12.0 million , $4.0 million and $0.4 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P233_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P234_S0	_______________ The Company calculates the present value of the pension liability using a discount rate of 5.10% which represents the single-rate equivalent of the AA rated corporate bond yield curve.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P235_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 8.20% in 2014 grading down to 4.30% in 2015 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P235_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P236_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P237_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P237_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains/losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P237_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P237_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P238_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P238_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P239_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P239_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P239_S2	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P239_S3	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P240_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P241_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P241_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P242_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P242_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P243_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P244_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P245_S0	Plan Fair Value Measurements ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P245_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P246_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P246_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P247_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 :

1085392_14_ITEM8_P253_S1	The partnerships are valued using the financial reports as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P253_S2	These investments are a Level 3 under ASC 820 because the significant valuation inputs are primarily internal to the partnerships with little third party involvement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P254_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P254_S1	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P256_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P256_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P256_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P257_S0	This is a money market fund.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P257_S1	The money market fund investments are valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P258_S0	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P259_S0	The details of income tax (benefit) expense are as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P260_S0	The following reconciliation compares pre-tax book income at the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the actual income tax expense in the Statements of Income:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P261_S0	The Company s deferred tax liability at December 31, 2013 and 2012 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P262_S0	The above amounts have been classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P263_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P263_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P263_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P264_S0	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2026 through 2033.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P264_S1	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2033.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P265_S0	For ratemaking purposes, deferred taxes are not provided for certain temporary differences.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P265_S1	PSE has established a regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through future rates related to those temporary differences for which no deferred taxes have been provided, based on prior and expected future ratemaking treatment.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P266_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P266_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P267_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P267_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P268_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P268_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P268_S2	For ASC 740 purposes, the Company has open tax years from 2010 through 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P268_S3	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S0	Residential Exchange The Northwest Power Act, through the Residential Exchange Program (REP), provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S1	The program is administered by the BPA.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S3	In 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) ruled that REP agreements of the BPA with PSE and a number of other investor-owned utilities were inconsistent with the Northwest Power Act.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S4	Since that time, those investor-owned utilities, including PSE, the BPA and other parties have been involved in ongoing litigation at the Ninth Circuit relating to the amount of REP benefits paid to utilities, including PSE, for the fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011 period and the amount of REP benefits to be paid going forward.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S5	In July 2011, the BPA, PSE and a number of other parties entered into a settlement agreement (2012 REP Settlement) that by its terms, if upheld in its entirety, would resolve the disputes between BPA and PSE regarding REP benefits paid for fiscal years 2002-2011 and determine REP benefits for fiscal years 2012-2028.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S6	In October 2011, certain other parties challenged BPA decisions with regard to its entering into the 2012 REP Settlement agreement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S7	On October 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit issued an order dismissing this challenge to this settlement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S8	In light of the disposition of this challenge, the stay of the other pending Ninth Circuit litigation regarding REP benefits was lifted in January 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S9	In the order lifting the stay, petitioners (unless they move to voluntarily dismiss their petitions) and intervenors (unless they move to voluntarily withdraw) were directed to file a statement explaining which issues, if any, remain pending.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S10	Such statements are due on or before April 1, 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S11	PSE is unable to determine prior to April 1, if this other pending litigation will continue and, if so, what impact these proceedings may have on PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S12	However, the Company believes it is unlikely that any unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse effect on PSE because REP benefits received by PSE are passed through directly to REP customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S13	With the Ninth Circuit s decision affirming the 2012 REP Settlement, PSE will receive approximately $57.0 million plus interests of REP payments owed under a 2008 agreement, which are in addition to scheduled monthly REP benefits received from BPA under the 2012 REP Settlement.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P269_S14	These payments will be given back to PSE's residential and small farm customers through a higher residential exchange credit on their bills.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P270_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P271_S0	On March 6, 2013, Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners (including PSE) alleging numerous claims for relief, most which relate to alleged prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) violations.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P271_S1	One claim relates to the alleged failure to update the Title V permit to reflect the major modifications alleged in the first 36 claims, another claim alleges that the previous Title V compliance certifications have been incomplete because they did not address the alleged major modifications, and the last claim alleges opacity violations since 2007.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P272_S0	The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District of Montana, Billings Division requesting injunctive relief and civil penalties, including a request that the owners remediate environmental damage and that $100,000 of the civil penalties be used for beneficial mitigation projects.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P273_S0	Discovery in the case has begun, and a prehearing conference took place in July 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P273_S1	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials set for March and August 2015, respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P273_S2	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P274_S0	Other Proceedings The Company is also involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P274_S1	The Company has recorded reserves of $1.4 million and $3.4 million relating to these claims as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013 , approximately 15.1% of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately $0.018 per kilowatt hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to the contractual shares that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P275_S5	The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P276_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company purchased portions of the power output of the PUDs' projects as set forth in the following table:
1085392_14_ITEM8_P277_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated payment obligations for power purchases from the Columbia River projects, contracts with other utilities and contracts with non-utilities.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P277_S1	These contracts have varying terms and may include escalation and termination provisions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P278_S0	Total purchased power contracts provided the Company with approximately 10.7 million , 6.1 million and 8.5 million megawatt hours (MWh) of firm energy at a cost of approximately $348.7 million , $203.1 million and $391.8 million for the years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P278_S1	The Company has natural gas-fired generation facility obligations for natural gas supply amounting to an estimated $118.6 million in 2014 .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P278_S2	Longer term agreements for natural gas supply amount to an estimated $318.1 million for 2015 through 2030.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P279_S0	PSE enters into short-term energy supply contracts to meet its core customer needs.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P279_S1	These contracts are sometimes classified as NPNS, however in most cases recorded at fair value in accordance with ASC 815.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P279_S2	Commitments under these contracts are $32.5 million , $10.8 million and $2.7 million in 2014 , 2015 and 2016 , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P280_S0	The Company has also entered into various firm supply, transportation and storage service contracts in order to ensure adequate availability of natural gas supply for its firm customers.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P280_S1	Many of these contracts, which have remaining terms from less than one year to 31 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual usage.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P280_S2	The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery obligation to ensure service to PSE s customers and generation requirements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P281_S0	The Company incurred demand charges in 2013 for firm transportation service and firm storage and peaking service of $160.8 million and $6.6 million , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P281_S1	The demand charge for firm natural gas supply was immaterial in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P281_S2	The Company incurred demand charges in 2013 for firm transportation and firm storage service for the natural gas supply for its combustion turbines in the amount of $39.5 million , which is included in the total Company demand charges.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P281_S3	The following table summarizes the Company s obligations for future demand charges through the primary terms of its existing contracts.

1085392_14_ITEM8_P283_S1	Automated meter reading system contractual obligation is the service component of the Landis and Gyr contract.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P284_S0	For information regarding PSE's environmental remediation obligations, see Note 3 Regulation and Rates.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S0	On June 1, 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a Demand Promissory Note (Note).
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S1	Through the Note, PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy, subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S2	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lowest of the weighted-average interest rate of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S3	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S4	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $29.6 million and $29.6 million , respectively, and the interest rate was 0.325% and 0.5% , respectively.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S5	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P285_S6	The $30.0 million credit facility with Puget Energy was unaffected by the merger.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P286_S0	On June 3, 2011, Puget Energy issued $500.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P286_S1	Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. acted as a co-manager and underwriter of this issue.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P286_S2	Net proceeds of $484.0 million from these notes were used to repay a portion of the outstanding $782.0 million term-loan.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P287_S0	Puget Energy s term-loan and credit facility for funding capital expenditures both were originally scheduled to mature in February 2014, and were syndicated among numerous committed banks and other financial institutions.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P287_S1	One of these banks was Macquarie Bank Limited.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P287_S2	On February 10, 2012, Puget Energy terminated the term loan and capital expenditure facility and replaced them with a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P287_S3	There are no related parties with commitments under the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility.
1085392_14_ITEM8_P288_S0	Concurrent with the borrowings under the term loan and capital expenditure credit agreements, Puget Energy entered into several interest rate swap instruments to hedge volatility associated with these two loans.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P1_S0	Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2013, the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P2_S0	Steve R. Secrist, Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P3_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P4_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P5_S0	Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P6_S0	Align compensation payment levels with achievement of Company goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P7_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of its executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (Cook Co.).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P7_S2	The Committee recommends to the full Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Cook Co., and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of awards under those plans.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P8_S0	In 2013, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P9_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total pay opportunity.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P9_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P9_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets base salary and total direct compensation (which is base salary plus annual and long-term incentive compensation) to the 50th percentile of this comparator group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P9_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P9_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P11_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P12_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P12_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded solely for meeting and exceeding target levels of annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P12_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P13_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P14_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P15_S0	Oversee the Company s succession planning process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P15_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P15_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P15_S3	Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P15_S4	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S2	Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S3	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group and is also designed to achieve current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S4	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive programs are designed to comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S5	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P16_S6	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2013 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P17_S0	The Committee annually reviews total compensation opportunity and actual total compensation received over the prior years by each executive officer in the form of a tally sheet.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P17_S1	This review helps inform the Committee s decisions on program designs by allowing the Committee to review overall pay received in relation to Company results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P18_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness To help inform the Committee s recommendations on base salary, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive programs, management prepares comprehensive compensation surveys for review by the Committee and Cook Co.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P18_S1	The surveys summarize data provided by the Towers Watson 2012 Energy Services survey for a selection of utility and other companies that are most similar in scope and size to PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P18_S2	For purposes of 2013 compensation, Cook Co. also suggested minor changes to the comparator peer group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P19_S0	Thirteen of the seventeen companies listed below are the same as used in 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P19_S1	Of the five companies not used in 2013, two companies had been acquired and one was publicly owned and not viewed as a comparator by Cook Co. Cook Co. recommended excluding two others and adding four new companies that were all included in the Towers Watson 2012 Energy Services survey.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P19_S2	Based on the recommendation of Cook Co. for the review of compensation pay levels and practices in 2013, we included the following utility companies in our comparator group that were all of similar scope (generally $1.5 billion $6.0 billion revenue and $4.0 billion $15.0 billion asset size) and also participated in the Towers Watson 2012 Energy Services survey:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S0	Base pay and total direct compensation are targeted to the 50th percentile of the industry comparator group assuming the Company s performance goals are achieved at target.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, total direct compensation is lower than this targeted level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S2	If Company performance significantly exceeds target, total cash compensation can approach or exceed the 75th percentile of the industry comparator group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S3	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S4	The Company may choose to pay an executive above or below the 50th percentile of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P20_S5	In addition to the foregoing survey data, the Committee generally also received advice from Cook Co. in connection with 2013 compensation decisions.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P21_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P21_S1	Base salaries are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of the comparator group and are reviewed annually by the Committee on an individual basis using as a guideline, the 50th percentile salary levels of our comparator group, as well as internal pay equity among our executives.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P21_S2	Actual salaries vary by individual and depend on additional factors, such as an individual s expertise, level of performance achievement, level of experience and level of contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P22_S0	Base Salary Adjustments The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2013 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P22_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries, and base salaries for 2013 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P22_S2	Effective March 1, 2013, the Board increased the base salary of Ms. Harris, President and CEO, from $820,000 to $875,000.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P22_S3	In establishing the salary amount for Ms. Harris, the Committee recommended and the Board approved a base salary that continued to be below the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group, reflecting Ms. Harris's length of tenure as President and CEO of the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P22_S4	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were in a range of 2% to 5%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P23_S0	Our annual and long-term incentive plans help focus executives on the priorities of our investors and customers and reward performance that meets or exceeds pre-established goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P24_S0	The Company s annual incentive plan rewards employees for the Company s performance on Service Quality Indices (SQIs), employee safety and EBITDA.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P24_S1	SQIs were developed in collaboration with the Company s regulator, the Washington Commission, and provide customers with a report card on the Company s customer service and reliability.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P25_S0	The Company's Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) rewards employees for the Company's performance on Total Return and Return on Equity (ROE).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P25_S1	Total Return reflects the annual change in the value of the Company plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P25_S2	The performance measures of EBITDA, Total Return, and ROE are all indicators of economic return to our investors, and their accomplishment indicates to our customers that the Company has the financial strength needed for long-term sustainability.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P26_S0	2013 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P26_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S0	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S1	For 2013, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against 9 SQIs covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S2	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S3	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S4	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards .
1085392_14_ITEM11_P27_S5	The SQIs for 2013 were the same as in 2012 and were as follows:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P28_S0	In 2013, to continue emphasizing the Company's commitment to employee safety, the Company included a safety performance measure in the annual incentive plan funding.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P28_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the 9 SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P28_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P29_S0	The safety performance measure contains five targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P29_S1	The five targets for 2013 were:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P30_S0	Office Supervisors receive appropriate safety and health training.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P30_S1	The completion rate for this target is no less than 95%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P30_S2	All new employees receive applicable safety and health orientation.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P30_S3	The target is no less than 95% for all new hires.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P31_S0	Increase Employee health by having employees complete health awareness training.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P31_S1	The completion rate of this target is no less than 95%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P32_S0	The Company Total Incident Case Rate (TICR) not to exceed a rate of 1.40 in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P32_S1	The Company Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) not to exceed a rate of 0.29 in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S0	In 2013, the annual incentive funding table required achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all 9 SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and target EBITDA performance for 100% funding of the plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S1	Eight of the nine SQIs were met.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S2	The one SQI which was not met, Calls Answered within 30 seconds, had been affected by the Company s implementation of a new customer service computer system.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S3	The Board of Directors approved considering the Calls Answered SQI met for incentive purposes.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S4	The Safety measure met on four out of five parts, but because all five were not met, it was not passed.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P33_S5	In total, 9 out of 10 customer service and safety measures were met or deemed met.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P34_S0	Funding levels at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P35_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not exclude any items for 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P36_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on a subjective evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P36_S1	Individual goals were developed from the overall corporate goals for 2013, set forth below:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P37_S0	Be well, get ready, stay safe - Make PSE a safe place to work.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P37_S1	Increase employee health, wellness and emergency preparedness.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P37_S2	Make our community a safe place by increasing awareness of emergency preparedness and investing in pipeline safety and reliability.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P38_S0	Drive value, drive growth - Give customers better reliability, more choices and greater value.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P38_S1	Improve dependability, and offer customers more choices to manage their accounts and services.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P38_S2	Drive growth and revenue through new services and products for our customers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P39_S0	Go big - Small steps won t get us where we need to be.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P39_S1	We are all accountable for continuously improving our processes to achieve our five-year plan by banishing waste, eliminating inefficiencies and focusing on the price of our service.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P40_S0	2013 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2013 was at target for EBITDA, and near target for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P40_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,155.6 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 9 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2013 of 90.36% under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P41_S0	For 2013, individual target incentive levels for this plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2013 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the individual executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P41_S1	Target annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for participating executives remained unchanged from 2012 levels except for Ms. Harris.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P41_S2	The Board approved an increase in 2013 target award for Ms. Harris.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P41_S3	The maximum incentive for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P42_S0	As described above, an executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on a subjective assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P42_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met or exceeded by each executive, small adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of the Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2013 and the following amounts were approved by the Board and paid at the amounts as shown below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P42_S2	The adjustments for individual performance did not materially change amounts from the formula amount of 90.36% of target.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P42_S3	The Committee similarly recommended an award amount for the CEO which included a small adjustment for individual performance in 2013 and to recognize that the Company met 2013 annual incentive goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P42_S4	The Board approved the amounts shown below, which were paid in March 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P43_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P44_S0	Prior to completion of our merger in February 2009, executives received equity awards under the Puget Energy 2005 LTI Plan in the form of performance shares and performance-based restricted stock.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P44_S1	Following our merger, the Company has continued the basic design of the pre-merger LTI Plan, including retention of three-year performance cycles that begin each year.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P44_S2	Since the Company no longer grants equity awards to its employees, LTI Plan awards are now denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P45_S0	The Committee determines the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating the actual payment and forecast target payment of long-term incentive awards of our market comparator group for comparable levels of responsibility.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P45_S1	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when granting annual incentive awards or making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P46_S0	Each year s grant is primarily viewed in the context of the compensation opportunity needed to maintain the Company s competitive position relative to the comparator group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P47_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the actual level of achievement of the performance measures as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P47_S1	Unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings level and is re-calculated each year in the performance period based on the change in Total Return for the prior year as measured by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P48_S0	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, disability or death.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P49_S0	The tables and points below summarize the performance measures and design of the LTI Plan grants for the performance cycles indicated below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P50_S0	______________ ** Total Return Component is determined based on a combination of Total Return and 3-year average SQI results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S0	Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Measures for 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 As described above, the LTI Plan structure from 2009 through 2011 maintained the basic design which had been in place prior to the Company's merger in 2009.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S1	Effective with the 2012-2014 LTI Plan grants, the Board approved certain modifications to the performance measures under the LTI Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S2	Pursuant to these modifications, SQI achievement was removed as a performance measure in favor of a new performance measure, Return on Equity (ROE).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S3	Total Return remains a key performance measure under the 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 performance cycles, consistent with prior performance cycles under the LTI Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S4	SQI achievement was removed to make the plan easier to understand and to remove the duplication of awards based on SQI performance, since SQI performance is already a performance measure under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S5	As a result of the modifications, both LTI Plan performance measures for the 2012-2014 and 2013-2015 performance cycles are financial in nature and each is weighted 50%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P51_S6	With the implementation of solely financial performance measures, the President and CEO position receives grants of LTI Plan units with a 50%/50% split between Total Return and ROE, like all other LTI Plan participants.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P52_S0	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2013-2015 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P52_S1	Target LTI Plan awards for the 2013-2015 performance cycle were 170% of base salary for Ms. Harris; 95% for Mr. Doyle, Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Mellies; and 50% for Mr. Secrist, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2012-2014 performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P52_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer for the 2013-2015 performance cycle is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $36.32.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P52_S3	The maximum incentive payable if exceptional performance is achieved on both performance measures for the LTI Plan is twice the target LTI Plan award.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P52_S4	Details of the number of units granted and expected value can be found in the 2013 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P53_S0	Long Term Incentive Plan Performance Measures for 2011-2013 With respect to the 2011-2013 performance cycle, except for the CEO, 50% of each grant of LTI Plan units is allocated to achievement of SQIs only (SQI component) and 50% is allocated to achievement of a combination of SQIs and Total Return (Total Return component).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P53_S1	The CEO s LTI Plan units are allocated 30% to the SQI component and 70% to the Total Return component to place additional weight on financial measures, consistent with our comparator group companies.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P53_S2	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P53_S3	For the 2011-2013 performance cycle, the initial per unit value was $33.80.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P54_S0	The total amount payable for a performance cycle is calculated at the end of the performance cycle based on the actual level of achievement of SQIs and Total Return as well as the per unit dollar value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P54_S1	For any award to be earned in the 2011-2013 performance cycle, average SQI results must meet or exceed 80% accomplishment of the applicable SQIs.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P54_S2	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards that could be earned based on three-year average SQI achievement.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P55_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return Component that could be earned based on three-year performance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P55_S1	Percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P56_S0	A target number of units were granted under this component at the beginning of the three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of 80% of SQIs during the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P56_S1	The actual award is paid at target level if an average of at least 80% of SQIs are satisfied during the performance cycle, but is not paid if the average is below 80%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P56_S2	If targeted SQI performance is met, the amount payable is equal to the product of the target number of units granted under this component and the per unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P57_S0	If 80% of SQIs are met during the performance cycle, but the Total Return threshold of 10% is not met, the SQI component will still be paid at target.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P58_S0	A target number of units were granted under this component at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle that will be paid in cash to the participant if the Company achieves the targeted level of Total Return and SQI performance during the three-year performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P58_S1	The actual award paid is based on Company performance relative to target, subject to a minimum threshold level of performance of 10% for Total Return (based on average Total Return over the performance cycle) and average SQI achievement of 80%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P59_S0	The LTI Plan unit value is determined annually by applying the Total Return for each year to the prior year s unit price.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P60_S0	At the completion of the performance cycle, if the Total Return component is paid, the participant receives a cash payment equal to the number of units earned under this component based on performance during the performance cycle multiplied by the unit price at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P61_S0	If the Total Return component exceeds 10% annualized 3-year return, but the SQI threshold is not met, the Total Return component will not be paid.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P62_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2015.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P63_S0	Performance on the Total Return component during 2013 was above the three-year average threshold needed for payment but below the target level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P64_S0	Performance on the ROE component for 2013 was below the target level but above the threshold level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P64_S1	This result will be one of the three annual ROE results averaged at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P65_S0	Award calculation is based on the full three-year performance cycle, so no award payment calculations will be made until after 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P66_S0	Performance on the Total Return component through 2012 and 2013 was below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P67_S0	Performance on the ROE component for 2012 was above the target level and for 2013 was below the target level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P67_S1	Through two years, the overall result on the ROE component is above the threshold level but below the target level.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P68_S0	2011-2013 Performance Cycle: The 2011-2013 performance cycle has now ended and had the performance described below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P69_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the table below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P70_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the combined three-year average was a compounded annual rate of 5.6%, below the three-year average threshold needed for payment.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P71_S0	______________ 2011-2013 actual LTI Plan amount payable is unit price $39.77 multiplied by SQI Component units.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P71_S1	The Total Return Component Units did not meet minimum performance threshold for payment.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P72_S0	The Company maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P72_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P73_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P73_S1	The Committee reviewed the SERP plan during 2012 with input from Cook Co. and modified the plan design to ensure alignment with competitive practices and with the retention goals of the program.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P74_S0	years of eligible compensation in the last ten years of service.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P74_S1	The plan changes do not increase the expected cost of the SERP program, and in certain instances are expected to decrease program costs.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P74_S2	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2013 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P75_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P75_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P75_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P76_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P76_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P76_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2013 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P77_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company), and Mr. Secrist (who was not then an officer), which amended and restated then existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the executives.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P77_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provided for an employment period of two years following the completion of a merger and otherwise generally provide benefits similar to those under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P77_S2	Since the 2009 merger, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P77_S3	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the comparator group.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P77_S4	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the current arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P78_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites targeted to competitive practices.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services, business club memberships and executive physicals up to an annual limit.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for individual use of club facilities.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P79_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P80_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P81_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value incentive opportunity for annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target level award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P81_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P82_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P83_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P84_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P84_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P85_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for achievement of Company goals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P85_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P85_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P85_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P86_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P86_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2013, except as noted below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P87_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P87_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P88_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P89_S0	The following information is furnished for the year ended December 31, 2013 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P89_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Mellies are executives of PSE only.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P89_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P90_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P91_S0	___________________ For 2013, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2013 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2011-2013 performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P91_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2014 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P91_S2	The 2013 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2014.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P92_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P92_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P92_S2	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2013 Pension Benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P92_S3	The change in pension value amounts for 2013 are: Ms. Harris, $1,462,607; Mr. Doyle, $269,754; Mr. Wiegand, $384,082; Ms. Mellies, $205,027; and Mr. Secrist, $304,051.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P93_S2	See the 2013 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table for all Deferred Compensation Plan earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P93_S3	All Other Compensation for 2013 is shown in detail in the table below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P94_S0	Ms. Harris was promoted to President and CEO from President on March 1, 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P94_S1	Mr. Doyle joined PSE and Puget Energy as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on November 28, 2011.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P95_S0	_______________ After an initial reimbursement up to $7,500, annual reimbursement for financial planning, tax planning, and/or legal planning, up to a maximum of $5,000 for Ms. Harris and $2,500 for the other Named Executive Officers.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P95_S1	This column also includes club use which is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P95_S2	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P96_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P97_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2013 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P98_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2013 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2013 of $1,040 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P98_S1	Payment would be $0 if either trigger is not met.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P98_S2	The threshold estimate assumes $1,040 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P98_S3	The target estimate assumes $1.155 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P98_S4	The maximum estimate assumes $1,559 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P99_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants were allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P99_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P100_S0	2013 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P100_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P100_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P100_S3	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P101_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P101_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P102_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2013 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P102_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are 4.0% for 2013 and are assumed to be 4.0% through 2017, and 5.0% annually thereafter.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P102_S2	The discount assumption is 5.10%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2014 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of % 1.37%, 4.05%, and 5.06% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2013).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2012 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S3	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0% for 2013 a discount assumption of 4.15% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2013 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.75%, 4.62% and 5.72% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2012).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P103_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2012 were the same as those used for December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P104_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P104_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P105_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P105_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Mr. Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible salaried employees, including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S3	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 will receive pay credits equal to 4%, which non-represented employees may choose to contribute to the Retirement Plan or to the Investment Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S4	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S5	For 2013, the limit was $255,000.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S6	For 2014, the limit is $260,000.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S7	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S8	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S9	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P106_S10	For 2013 and 2014, the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S4	This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P107_S7	As of December 31, 2013, all the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P108_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P108_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P109_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P109_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P109_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P109_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P109_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P110_S0	If a participant in the cash balance portion of the Retirement Plan dies while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, then his or her Retirement Plan benefit will be immediately vested.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P110_S1	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P110_S2	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P111_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P111_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P112_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Company modified certain features of the SERP, effective January 1, 2013, to ensure alignment with competitive practices and with the retention goals of the plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P112_S1	The plan changes do not increase the expected cost of the SERP program, and in certain instances are expected to decrease program costs.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P112_S2	The plan changes include an additional vesting requirement for new participants to attain age 55 prior to vesting and a modified calculation of highest average earnings for all participants.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P112_S3	The changes are reflected below in the description of SERP benefit calculations.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P112_S4	The changes apply to existing and prospective SERP participants unless otherwise noted.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P113_S0	compared to the benefit amount calculated under plan terms prior to January 1, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P113_S1	On an ongoing basis, as new participants join the program, the plan changes will lead to reduced aggregate costs attributable to SERP.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P114_S0	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P114_S1	All the participating Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P114_S2	SERP participants as of December 31, 2013, who had not yet attained age 55 at that date, including Ms. Harris, Ms. Mellies, and Mr. Secrist, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P114_S3	The Board added a special vesting requirement for Ms. Harris to continue Company service through December 31, 2016 in order to vest additional SERP benefit value after December 31, 2012.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P115_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a vested executive (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below: (1) One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P115_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P115_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P116_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P116_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P116_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P117_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P117_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P118_S0	(2) The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P118_S1	(3) The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account).
1085392_14_ITEM11_P118_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2013 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S4	Mr. Wiegand is the only Named Executive Officers eligible for early retirement benefit payments under the SERP as of December 31, 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S5	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S6	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P119_S7	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P120_S0	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding aggregate executive and Company contributions and aggregate earnings for 2013 and year-end account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P121_S0	The amount reported in this column reflects contributions by PSE consisting of the annual investment plan restoration amount and annual cash balance restoration amount described below.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P121_S1	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P121_S2	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P121_S3	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2013.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P122_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P122_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P122_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P122_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P123_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P123_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P123_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P123_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P123_S4	The 2013 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_14_ITEM11_P124_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P125_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P126_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P127_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P127_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P127_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P127_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P128_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P128_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P128_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).

1085392_14_ITEM11_P130_S0	Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P130_S1	In addition, each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Doyle and Mr. Secrist, entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with the Company in March 2009, which provides for benefits or payments upon certain terminations of employment from the Company following the 2009 merger or a subsequent change in control.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P131_S2	The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance.
1085392_14_ITEM11_P131_S3	The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65% of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits.

1085392_14_ITEM11_P140_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.

1085392_14_ITEM13_P12_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, William Ayer (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Mary McWilliams (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Melanie Dressel (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), and Herbert Simon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P13_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P13_S1	The Company s definition of Independent Director is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P14_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P14_S1	The Board has also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P14_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P14_S3	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P15_S0	Messrs. Ayer and Simon, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P15_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P15_S2	In addition, PSE has entered into transactions with entities for whom Mr. Simon and Mr. Ayer serve as a director, or in which they otherwise have a financial interest, that involve amounts that are less than the greater of $1.0 million or 1% of those entities consolidated gross revenue.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P15_S3	These transactions fall within the second categorical standard described above.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P15_S4	Because these relationships either fall within the Board s categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P16_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P16_S1	Mr. Ayer, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.
1085392_14_ITEM13_P17_S0	Interested parties may communicate with the non-management directors of the Board through the procedures described in Item 10 of Part III of this annual report under the section Communications with the Board.

1085392_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	GENERAL Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings) completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	Corporate Strategy Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution, generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	The following table presents the number of PSE customers as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	During 2014 , PSE s billed retail and transportation revenue from electric utility operations were derived 51.5% from residential customers, 41.7% from commercial customers, 5.4% from industrial customers and 1.4% from other customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	PSE s billed retail revenue from natural gas utility operations were derived 66.5% from residential customers, 29.1% from commercial customers, 2.6% from industrial customers and 1.8% from transportation customers in 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM1_P6_S2	During this period, the largest customer accounted for approximately 1.5% of PSE s operating revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns and varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which makes quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P7_S1	Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P7_S2	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently often higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and subsequently lower power costs in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P7_S3	While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms which went into effect on July 1, 2013 for electric and gas operations, are expected to diminish the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	As a result, these electric and gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	The energy supply costs, which are part of the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) and Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	In the five-year period ended December 31, 2014 , PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.7 billion and retirements were $409.3 million .
1085392_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	In the same five-year period, PSE s gross natural gas utility plant additions were $723.2 million and retirements were $96.6 million and PSE s gross common utility plant additions were $390.7 million and retirements were $372.4 million .
1085392_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2014 was approximately $9.3 billion , which consisted of 36.0% distribution, 41.8% generation, 14.0% transmission and 8.2% general plant and other.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Gross natural gas utility plant at December 31, 2014 was approximately $3.3 billion , which consisted of 93.3% distribution and 6.7% general plant and other.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2014 was approximately $512.8 million .
1085392_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	Employees At December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy had no employees and PSE had approximately 2,700 full-time employees.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P10_S1	Approximately 1,100 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_15_ITEM1_P10_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire on September 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	Corporate Location Puget Energy s and PSE s principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Item 10 Part III of this annual report.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	REGULATION AND RATES PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE filed revised tariffs seeking to update its rates established in its base rate proceedings in May 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	The ERF was limited in scope and rate impact.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	This filing was primarily intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms, described below, are proposed to operate.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	The filing also provided for the collection of property taxes through a property tax tracker mechanism based on cash payments of property tax made by PSE during the year.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P15_S3	Any difference between the cash payments and property tax valuation accruals will be deferred and recovered in a property tax tracker.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Decoupling On October 25, 2012, PSE and the Northwest Energy Coalition (NWEC) filed a petition for an order seeking approval of an electric and a natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs and authority to record accounting entries associated with the mechanisms.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	Included in the amended decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another general rate case process over the plan period.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	The rate plan includes predetermined annual increases (K factor) to PSE's allowed electric and gas delivery revenue (transmission and distribution), which are effective January of each year, currently 3.0% for electric and 2.2% for gas.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S3	Under this plan, PSE, with limited exceptions, would be allowed to file its next general rate case no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016 unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S4	PSE would continue to be authorized to file for rate changes under existing rate mechanisms such as the PCA and PGA mechanism, and emergency rate relief during the rate plan period.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S5	PSE's rates related to the cumulative deferred decoupling mechanism, accrued at each rate group through the calendar year and effective May 1 in the following year, will be subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P16_S6	Any amount in excess of the soft cap will be added to the decoupling tracker in subsequent rate periods, subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases in the subsequent year.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	The customers share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12 month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	The rate change incorporated the effects of an increase to the allowed delivery revenue per customer as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric of $10.6 million , or 0.5% annually on total electric revenue, and a rate decrease for natural gas of $1.0 million , or 0.1% annually on total gas revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	Washington Commission Decision On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial reviews of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P19_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P19_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter were held on May 9, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P19_S3	On June 25, 2014, the court issued a letter decision in which it affirmed the attrition adjustment (escalating factors referred to as the K-Factor) and the Washington Commission's decision not to consider the case as a general rate case, but reversed and remanded the cost of equity for further adjudication consistent with the court's decision.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P19_S4	As a result, there will be evidentiary proceedings regarding return on equity (ROE) in the first quarter of 2015 with an order anticipated in the first half of 2015.

1085392_15_ITEM1_P40_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) (for 44 aMW of capacity) and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity).
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	Further, PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S6	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S7	In 2014 , PSE had 4,646 MW and 695 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P42_S8	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	During 2014 , approximately 91.2% of natural gas for power purchased by PSE for power customers originated in British Columbia and 8.8% originated in the United States.

1085392_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	As part of the resource planning process, PSE filed an IRP in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	The 2013 IRP identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2013 IRP.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	In 2013, PSE renewed all the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) transmission available for renewal during the year to meet peak capacity needs.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	As part of the 2013 PCORC, PSE sought approval for the Mid-C transmission renewals executed in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	As the Washington Commission approved all the Mid-C transmission renewals requested in the 2013 PCORC, PSE expects to have sufficient resources to meet its capacity needs over the next few years.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P46_S4	On February 6, 2014, the Washington Commission formally accepted PSE's 2013 IRP filing.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P47_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial fixed-price derivative instruments to hedge the cost of natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P47_S2	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P47_S3	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	_______________ All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in off-peak periods, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P50_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P50_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P50_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; and interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P52_S0	During 2014 , approximately 57.1% of natural gas purchased by PSE for its natural gas customers originated in British Columbia, 18.1% originated in Alberta and 24.8% originated in the United States.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P53_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P53_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during off-peak periods to minimize costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P53_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside PSE s service territory (off-system sales) whenever on-system customer demand requirements permit and the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P54_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P55_S0	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P55_S1	Of this total, PSE holds 397,000 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers, which represents nearly 45.7% of PSE's expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P55_S2	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P55_S3	Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 600,000 Dth of the storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P55_S4	In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 200,0000 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P56_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P56_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of three and five years and has rights to extend such agreements.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P56_S2	PSE s total storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin, net of temporarily releases, exceeds 8.9 million Dth and is over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P57_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P57_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P58_S0	PSE contracts for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned gas at NWP s Plymouth facility, at a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P59_S0	During 2014 , PSE, working with NWP, determined that the pipeline redelivery to PSE from the Plymouth LNG facility can no longer be considered firm and reliable during peak conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P59_S1	Therefore, PSE has removed the Plymouth service from its firm portfolio and given notice to NWP of its intent to terminate the Plymouth service agreement effective October 31, 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P59_S2	PSE is negotiating with NWP and other market participants to replace the Plymouth service with an alternate firm resource to accommodate expected future load growth.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P60_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.

1085392_15_ITEM1_P64_S3	PSE has annual renewal rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P64_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity on the GTN pipeline, totaling approximately 90,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of nine years and the first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P65_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P65_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P65_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P66_S0	has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P66_S1	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P66_S2	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S0	ENERGY EFFICIENCY PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S3	PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S4	However, the rider mechanisms do not provide for any cost recovery of lost sales margin associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P67_S5	To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2013 from the Washington Commission for electric and gas decoupling mechanisms.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	Since 1997, PSE has recovered direct electric energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through an electric rider mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	To recover gas expenditures, from 1997 to 2011, PSE used a tracker mechanism, which recovered actual gas expenditures in the year following the year in which the expenditures were incurred.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P68_S2	In 2012, the Washington Commission directed PSE to convert gas expenditure recovery to a rider mechanism, consistent with the electric expenditure recovery methodology.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P68_S3	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects them in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P69_S0	ENVIRONMENT PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P69_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA) and all have CAA Title V operation permits which must be renewed every five years.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	PSE continues to monitor these developments to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P70_S5	The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Act.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P72_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Remediation of Contamination PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The primary cleanup laws that PSE is subject to include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_15_ITEM1_P74_S1	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and the dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	This includes most generation facilities (and all those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	RECENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND REGULATION Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P78_S2	Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P79_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P79_S2	As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P79_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P79_S4	PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	On January 8, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	The EPA first proposed a NSPS for emissions for CO2 from new power plants in April 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S2	However, after more than 2.5 million comments on the original proposal, the EPA decided that a new approach was warranted and rescinded the April 2012 proposal.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S3	The EPA is currently proposing an emissions limit for coal-fired sources of 1,100 lb.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S4	CO2/MWh, and proposes standards for natural gas combined cycle sources from 1,000 to 1,100 lb.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P80_S5	CO2/MWh depending on the size and type of unit.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	Under the January 8, 2014 NSPS proposal, the Agency concluded that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been adequately demonstrated as a technology for controlling CO2 emissions in full-scale commercial applications at coal-fired electrical generating units (EGUs), while reaching the opposite conclusion, that CCS is not adequately demonstrated, in the case of gas-fired generators.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P81_S1	PSE submitted comments by the end of the comment period on May 9, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P81_S2	The EPA is expected to issue the final rule within the next 12 months.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P81_S3	States have one year after the effective date of the standard to adopt the final rule.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed guidelines under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for the control of CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P82_S1	The proposed guidelines are estimated by the EPA to reduce total power sector carbon emissions 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 through the setting of individual emissions targets for each state.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	The EPA is applying its best system of emission reductions (BSER) approach for reducing CO2 emissions from the electric power sector, consisting of increasing the efficiency of power generation and substituting higher emitting plants with lower emitting technologies.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	The EPA is using the following four step approach to establish its reduction targets: (1) improving the heat rate of individual generating units, thereby reducing the amount of CO2 produced per unit of electricity generated, (2) prioritizing dispatch of existing (and new) natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) generation over coal-fired generation, (3) accounting for increasing renewable generation and nuclear generation that is under construction or will have extended life and (4) improving demand-side energy efficiency to reduce the amount of electricity generation required.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	States will be given the flexibility to choose the emissions reduction strategies best suited to their reduction requirements, and they can select technologies and techniques beyond what is defined in BSER, provided the emission reductions are verifiable and approved by the EPA.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	States must achieve their state-specific interim goal by 2025 and their state-specific final goal by 2030.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	PSE filed comments on this rule on December 1, 2014, which was the end of the comment period.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	The EPA initially stated that it will issue a final rule in June 2015 and that states must submit a plan for implementing CO2 reductions to the EPA one to three years following issuance of the final rule.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P84_S4	Recently the EPA extended this timeframe and stated that it plans to issue the final 111(d) and 111(b) rules simultaneously in August 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	Each year, PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the State of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the EPA.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S4	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2013 were 9.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S5	Approximately 41.4% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.1 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S6	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an essential part of the existing diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P85_S7	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Compliance based on a rolling 12-month average was first confirmed in January 2011 and has continued to meet the requirement.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P87_S1	Generating units have 3 years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P87_S2	Testing confirms that Colstrip currently meets the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	Units 3 4 meet the particulate surrogate for other metals.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Modifications to the Unit 1 2 scrubbers are required to meet the particulate limit in the MATS rule.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P88_S2	PSE has installed sieve trays in three of the six scrubbers and will install them in the remaining scrubbers by 2016.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P88_S3	Testing of the scrubbers subsequent to modification shows that it can meet the MATS particulate limit.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	Additional Colstrip Emission Controls On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P90_S0	The final Federal Implementation Plan for Montana (FIP) for Regional Haze was issued in September 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P90_S1	There are no immediate requirements for Units 3 4, but Units 1 2 will need to upgrade pollution controls to meet new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P91_S0	The Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) on November 15, 2012 and PPL Montana also filed an appeal as the Colstrip operator.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P91_S1	The case was heard on May 15, 2014 in Seattle, Washington and a final decision by the Ninth Circuit is still pending.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P91_S2	PSE cannot at this time predict the impact of the matter on the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P92_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On June 21, 2010, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking for the Identification and Listing of Special Wastes: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) from Electric Utilities which proposes different regulatory mechanisms to regulate coal ash.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P92_S1	On December 19, 2014, the EPA signed and made public a final rule, although this rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P92_S2	The new rule proposes a non-hazardous approach to regulating CCRs.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P93_S0	The rule is intended to regulate the disposal of CCR as solid waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
1085392_15_ITEM1_P93_S1	Subtitle D establishes nationally applicable minimum criteria for the safe, environmentally-sound waste management practices for the disposal of non-hazardous solid waste in landfills and surface impoundments (often referred to as ponds).
1085392_15_ITEM1_P93_S2	The actual planning and direct implementation of the solid waste program under Subtitle D remains with the state and local regulators.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P94_S0	Included in the rule s minimum criteria are requirements for location restrictions, design criteria, surface and groundwater monitoring and enhanced record keeping.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P94_S1	PSE is currently evaluating the final rule and cannot at this time predict the impact of the matter on the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P95_S0	PCB Handling and Disposal On April 7, 2010, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule Making (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P95_S1	The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P95_S2	The rule is currently scheduled to be published in July 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P96_S0	Because the EPA received extensive comments, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P96_S1	At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this ANPRM will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P97_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of February 27, 2015 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P98_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P99_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of February 27, 2015 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_15_ITEM1_P100_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic test year costs plus normalized assumptions about rate year power costs, weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Non-energy costs for natural gas retail customers are based on historic test year costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than what is allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	In addition, the Washington Commission decides what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S4	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P4_S5	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	PSE has additional risks associated with the Washington Commission approved stay out period, which doesn't allow for any general rate case filings to be filed earlier than April 1, 2015 without extraordinary circumstances.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	PSE will have additional risks if PSE's costs are not within the pre-approved annual increases in allowed revenue per customer (3.3% for electric customers; 2.2% natural gas customers), as earnings will be below the authorized rate of return and due to the stay out period, PSE cannot file for general rate increases unless it is for emergency rate relief.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S2	If PSE earns above its authorized rate of return, PSE will need to share the excess earnings above the threshold of 7.8% with customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so the risk would be if PSE over earns on one and under earns on the other service, PSE would still be obligated to share the earnings for that service exceeding the threshold (there is no offset for the service under earning).
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	PSE may be unable to acquire energy supply resources to meet projected customer needs or may fail to successfully integrate such acquisitions.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S1	PSE projects that future energy needs will exceed current purchased and Company owned and controlled power resources in the near future.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As part of PSE s business strategy, it plans to acquire additional electric generation and delivery infrastructure to meet customer needs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S3	If PSE cannot acquire additional energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could significantly increase its expenses thus reducing earnings and cash flows.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P8_S4	Additionally, PSE may not be able to timely recover some or all of those increased expenses through ratemaking.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	While PSE expects to identify the benefits of new energy supply resources prior to their acquisition and integration, it may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such energy supply sources.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, increased customer demand for energy, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Factors which could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its load requirements and/or high volumes of energy purchased in wholesale markets at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If PSE is unable to protect its physical assets from terrorist attacks or its information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite PSE's implementation of security measures, its physical assets and technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, these physical asset or cyber-based attacks could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	As a result, PSE endeavors to maintain unceasing vigilance against the continuous threat of physical asset and cyber-based attacks.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets as well as to supply and price risks affecting PSE s construction and maintenance programs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In connection with matching loads and resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	subject to supply and price risks affecting these items.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	To lower its financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, PSE may use forward delivery agreements, swaps and option contracts to hedge commodity price risk with a diverse group of counterparties.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	However, PSE does not always cover the entire exposure of its assets or positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P19_S3	To the extent PSE has unhedged positions or its hedging procedures do not work as planned, fluctuating commodity prices could adversely impact its results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To comply with these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse gas legislation, including an emission performance standard provision.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	While PSE cannot yet determine costs associated with these or future decisions or potential future legislation, there may be a significant impact on the cost of carbon-intensive coal generation, in particular.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P24_S1	PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	PSE also hires third parties to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based in part on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2015 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in general rate cases could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Potential municipalization or technological developments may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	When a town or city in our service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires our assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that we provide.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P33_S2	In addition, there is also the risk that advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of April 15, 2018.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	No amount was outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Puget Energy's credit facility includes an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Puget Energy is party to three separate term loan agreements totaling $299.0 million, which it entered into on June 26, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	The term loans mature in 2016 and 2017.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	PSE also has two credit facilities, which provide PSE with access to $1.0 billion in short-term borrowing capability, and include an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The two PSE credit facilities mature on April 15, 2019.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	As of December 31, 2014, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.4 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2014 had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital and the ability to hedge in wholesale markets.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these taxes.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P44_S3	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Potential legislation and regulatory actions could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) was signed into law.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Title VII of the Dodd-Frank law gave regulators including the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to create new oversight structures for derivative financial instruments, which were widely thought to have contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P46_S2	The new regulation of certain over-the-counter swaps could expand collateral requirements of swaps, which may make it more costly for companies and/or limit the Company s ability to enter into such transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Dodd-Frank law amended section 2(h) (7) of the Commodities Exchange Act to provide an elective exemption from the clearing requirements of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank law for any entity that is not a financial entity, is using swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk, and notifies the CFTC, in a manner set forth by the CFTC, how it generally meets its financial obligations associated with entering into non-cleared swaps.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The Company has elected to employ the "End-User Exception" to clearing on its applicable treasury department transactions, and will likely employ the End-User Exception to clearing on commodities transactions after applicable final regulations for those transactions are adopted.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The Company continues to evaluate the legislation and the CFTC s implementation of it to determine its impact, if any, on the Company s hedging program, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The Company is aware that the Dodd-Frank law will increase recordkeeping and certain administrative costs for applicable transactions, but will not know the full impact of the new legislation until the regulations are finalized and the Company's compliance systems are fully implemented.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution, unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than three to one.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S8	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2014 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.3 to 1.0 for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_15_ITEM1A_P48_S9	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Gas Supply.
1085392_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative/rule-making proceedings relating to its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_15_ITEM3_P1_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S0	On March 6, 2013, Sierra Club and Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC) filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners (including PSE) in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S1	Based on a second amended complaint filed in August 2014, Plaintiffs lawsuit currently alleges violations of permitting requirements under the New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act and the Montana State Implementation Plan arising from seven projects undertaken at Colstrip from 2001-2012.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S2	Plaintiffs have since indicated that they do not intend to pursue two of the seven projects, leaving a total of five projects remaining.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S3	The lawsuit claims that, for each project, Colstrip should have obtained a permit and installed pollution control equipment at Colstrip.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S4	The Plaintiffs complaint also seeks civil penalties and other appropriate relief.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S5	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S6	Discovery in the case is ongoing.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S7	The liability trial is currently set for November 2015, and a date for the remedy trial has yet to be determined.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P2_S8	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the complaint and as such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the outcome of this matter.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S0	In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S1	The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S2	PSE filed comments on this rule in December 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S3	The EPA initially stated that it will issue a final rule in June 2015 and that states must submit a plan for implementing CO2 reductions to the EPA one to three years following issuance of the final rule.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S4	Recently the EPA extended the time to issue the final rule to August 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S5	PSE is continuing to review of the proposed rule and work with key stakeholders to monitor it as the rule moves forward towards possible final implementation.
1085392_15_ITEM3_P3_S6	PSE cannot yet provide a determination of how the final rule, may impact PSE or its existing generation facilities, if at all.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings, and are not publicly traded.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P0_S2	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P0_S3	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P0_S4	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	From time to time, when deemed advisable and permitted, each of PSE and Puget Energy pay dividends on its common stock.
1085392_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , PSE paid dividends to its parent, Puget Energy, and Puget Energy paid dividends to its parent, Puget Equico, in the amounts shown in Puget Energy's and PSE's Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity, included in this report.
1085392_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables show selected financial data.
1085392_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with the Management Discussion and Analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S1	The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy and PSE objectives, expectations and intentions.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S2	Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S3	However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S4	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S5	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P1_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P2_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P3_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P3_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P3_S2	Puget Energy accounted for the merger as a business combination and all its assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE's basis of accounting continues to be on a historical basis and PSE's financial statements do not include any purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P3_S4	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company's mission is to be a safe, dependable and efficient utility.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P4_S1	The Company's objectives are to focus on safety, employees, operational excellence, customer service and financial strength.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P4_S2	The Company's strategies are aligned to achieve these objectives and ultimately the Company's mission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P4_S3	These strategies involve numerous commitments and investments related to utility infrastructure and customer service, which may give rise to expenditures that may not be recovered timely through the ratemaking process.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S0	PSE has undertaken several initiatives to reduce the volatility and regulatory lag in the business.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S1	During 2013, PSE completed an ERF, which is a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S2	The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate going forward.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S3	The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the annual cash payments for the year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S4	The decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S5	Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another general rate case process during the rate plan period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S6	The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE s allowed electric and natural gas revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S7	This plan, with limited exceptions (PCORC or emergency rate relief), requires PSE to file a general rate case no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S8	The decoupling mechanism also allows for decoupling revenue on a per customer basis to subsequently increase by 3.0% for electric customers and 2.2% for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the effective date of PSE s next general rate case.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P5_S9	In addition, the decoupling mechanism reduces earnings volatility, but does not materially affect the timing of cash flow due to the timing difference between the recognition of decoupling revenue and resulting impacts on rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P6_S0	Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue conservation initiatives that promote efficient use of energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P7_S0	from lower sales volumes as power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P7_S1	This mandate, however, will only have a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P8_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P8_S1	PSE expects to be in balance between its load requirements and generation resources for the next two or three years.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P9_S1	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P9_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year, PSE s net income was affected by the following four factors: (1) changes in unrealized gain and loss in derivative instruments for energy contracts; (2) increase in utility operations and maintenance expense due to bad debt expense and transmission and distribution expenses; (3) increased gas and electric margins driven by decoupling, which went into effect July 1, 2013 and (4) a reduction in interest income related to regulatory assets.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P9_S3	Further detail on each of these primary drivers, as well as other factors affecting performance, is set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion Analysis.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P10_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized loss on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P11_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P11_S1	The presentation of return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instruments is intended to supplement readers understanding of the Company s operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P12_S0	Return on equity excluding unrealized loss on derivative instrument is used by the Company to determine whether the Company is collecting the appropriate earnings from its customers to allow recovery of investors' capital.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P13_S0	The return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity is not intended to represent the regulated return on equity.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P13_S1	PSE's return on equity may not be comparable to other companies return on equity measures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P13_S2	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace return on equity (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P13_S3	The following table presents PSE s authorized regulated return on equity for 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM7_P14_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), subsidiary retained earnings and retained earnings of derivative instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s 2014 return on AMA equity, excluding unrealized gains and loss on derivative instruments and any impacts of OCI, subsidiary retained earnings and retained earnings of derivative instruments, was 8.2% , which is lower than the authorized regulated return on equity primarily due to the following:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $22.1 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P16_S1	The increase was driven by higher costs in electric production, general and administration, bad debt and customer service expenses.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P17_S0	Depreciation expense was $5.3 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric expenditures placed into service.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	The Company s 2013 return on equity, excluding derivative instruments, was 8.0%, which is lower than the authorized return on equity primarily due to the following:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P19_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $15.6 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P19_S1	The increase was driven by an increase in costs in electric production, administration and general expenses and customer service expense.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P20_S0	Depreciation expense was $36.4 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P20_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric expenditures placed into service.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P21_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance PSE s regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2014 and future years.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P21_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P21_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales, as well as by its customers conservation investments, which reduces energy sales.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P21_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	cost growth, thus rate increases are required.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	If, in a particular year, PSE's costs are higher than what is currently allowed to be recovered in rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether expenses and investments are reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P22_S6	If the Washington Commission determines that some of PSE's costs do not meet the standard applied, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	Expedited Rate Filing On February 4, 2013, PSE filed revised tariffs seeking to update its rates established in its base rate proceedings in May 2012 known as an Expedited Rate Filing (ERF).
1085392_15_ITEM7_P23_S1	The ERF was limited in scope and rate impact.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P23_S2	This filing was primarily intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms, described below, are proposed to operate.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P23_S3	The filing also provided for the collection of property taxes through a property tax tracker mechanism based on cash payments of property tax made by PSE during the year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P23_S4	Any difference between the cash payments and property tax valuation accruals will be deferred and recovered in a property tax tracker.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S0	Included in the amended decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another general rate case process over the plan period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S1	The rate plan includes predetermined annual increases (K factor) to PSE's allowed electric and gas delivery revenue (transmission and delivery), which are effective January of each year, currently 3.0% for electric and 2.2% for gas.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S2	Under this plan, PSE, with limited exceptions, would be allowed to file its next general rate case no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016 unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S3	PSE would continue to be authorized to file for rate changes under existing rate mechanisms such as the PCA and PGA mechanism, and emergency rate relief during the rate plan period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S4	PSE's rates related to the cumulative deferred decoupling mechanism accrued by each rate group through the calendar year and effective May 1 in the following year, will be subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S5	Any amount in excess of the soft cap will be added to the decoupling tracker in subsequent rate periods, subject to a 3.0% soft cap on rate increases in the subsequent year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S6	In addition, PSE and its customers would have shared 50.0% each in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.8%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P24_S7	The customers' share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12 month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P25_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P25_S1	The rate change incorporated the effects of an increase to the allowed delivery revenue per customer as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P25_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric of $10.6 million, or 0.5% annually on total electric revenue, and a rate decrease for natural gas of $1.0 million, or 0.1% annually on total gas revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P26_S0	Washington Commission Decision On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P26_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter were held on May 9, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P26_S3	On June 25, 2014, the court issued a letter decision in which it affirmed the attrition adjustment K-Factor and the Washington Commission's decision not to consider the case as a general rate case, but reversed and remanded the cost of equity for further adjudication consistent with the court's decision.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P26_S4	As a result, there will be evidentiary proceedings regarding return on equity (ROE) in the first quarter of 2015 with an order anticipated in the first half of 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	Electric Rates PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	PSE under recovered during the year ended December 31, 2014 , due to $40.1 million below the power cost baseline level of which $10.1 million was apportioned to customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	This compares to an over recovery of $37.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 of which $8.9 million was apportioned to customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million, or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million, or 1.3% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The rate change passed through eleven months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over eleven months beginning February 1, 2013, including grant amortization pass-back of $34.6 million and interest pass-back of $23.8 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.8%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	On October 23, 2013, the Washington Commission approved an update on the Company's PCORC, effective November 1, 2013, which reflected decreases in the overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	This resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of $10.5 million, or 0.5% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	On December 27, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $58.5 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P33_S2	Of the total credit, $37.8 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $20.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2013 rate period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P33_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.3%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S1	This represents a rate increase for electric of $10.6 million , or 0.5% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S2	On November 3, 2014, the Washington Commission issued an order on the settlement of the PCORC, which PSE filed on May 23, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S3	The original filing proposed a decrease of $9.6 million (or an average of approximately 0.5%) in the Company's overall power supply costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S4	PSE filed joint testimony supporting a settlement stipulation.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S5	Customer rates decreased by approximately $19.4 million, or 0.9% annually, as a result of the settlement, effective December 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P34_S6	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P35_S0	Natural Gas Rates PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P35_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P35_S2	A receivable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery of natural gas cost through rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P36_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's consolidated electric and natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million, or 3.2% annually, and an increase in natural gas rates of $13.4 million, or 1.3% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P36_S1	The rate increases for electric and natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P36_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P37_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P37_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P37_S2	The Washington Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P37_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of $6.6 million, the difference being recognized as revenue sensitive taxes.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P38_S0	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P38_S1	The rates resulted in a decrease to the rates charged to customers under the PGA.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P38_S2	On May 1, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the proposed rates and allowed them to be made permanent.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P38_S3	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is a decrease of $77.0 million, or 7.7% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P38_S4	The rate adjustment has no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P39_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff, effective on November 1, 2013, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P39_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is an increase of $4.0 million, or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P40_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's Pipeline Replacement Program Plan (PRPP) that would accelerate and enhance the safety of the natural gas system and ultimately reduce costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P40_S1	Under the PRPP plan, PSE would be allowed to file a tariff revision to recover its costs associated with the acceleration of the replacement of natural gas pipelines with the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P40_S2	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P40_S3	This represents a rate decrease for natural gas of $1.0 million , or 0.1% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P40_S4	On October 30, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing with an effective date of November 1, 2014, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P41_S0	The impact to the PGA rates is an annual revenue decrease of $23.3 million, or 2.5% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P41_S1	For additional information, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P42_S0	Weather Conditions Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P43_S0	PSE's operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P43_S1	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P43_S2	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P43_S3	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P44_S0	PSE reported lower usage by its residential electric customers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to Pacific Northwest temperatures being warmer on average as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P44_S1	The actual average temperature during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was 55.34 degrees, or 1.01 degrees warmer than the same period in the prior year, and 2.70 degrees warmer when compared to the historical average.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S0	Revenue Decoupling While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms which went into effect on July 1, 2013 for electric and gas operations, are expected to diminish the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S1	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to eliminate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S2	As a result, these electric and gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S3	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S4	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P45_S5	Following each calendar year, PSE will bill or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers during the following May to April time period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P46_S0	Effective January 1, 2014, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers' rate schedules were excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, PSE will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns for these customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P47_S0	Customer Demand PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above that of electric customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P47_S1	PSE also expects energy usage by both residential electric and natural gas customers to continue a long-term trend of slow decline primarily due to continued energy efficiency improvements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P48_S0	Access to Debt Capital PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P48_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P48_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P48_S3	For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P48_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P49_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P49_S1	PSE's credit facilities expire in 2019 and Puget Energy's senior secured credit facility expires in 2018.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P49_S2	(See discussion on credit facilities in the section entitled Financing Program - Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper ).
1085392_15_ITEM7_P50_S0	Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P50_S1	These regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P50_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation byproducts such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P50_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates, and on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees in order to comply with these regulatory requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P51_S0	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change and generation by-products, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P52_S0	PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers currently do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier and therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P52_S2	Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P52_S3	In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P52_S4	Further, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers in its service territory.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P53_S0	As noted in PSE's IRP filed with the Washington Commission, PSE projects that beginning in 2017, its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P53_S1	The IRP identifies reductions in contractual supplies of energy and capacity available under certain long-term power purchase agreements, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P53_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P54_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the open market at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, significantly increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P55_S0	PSE is investing in its utility infrastructure and customer service functions in order to meet regulatory requirements, serve customers energy needs and replace aging infrastructure.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P55_S1	These investments and operating requirements give rise to significant growth in depreciation, amortization and operating expenses, which are not recovered through the ratemaking process in a timely manner.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P56_S0	Operational Risks Associated With Generating Facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P57_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered, solar and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P58_S0	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels, including facility shutdowns due to equipment and process failures or fuel supply interruptions.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P58_S1	PSE does not have business interruption insurance coverage to cover replacement power costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P59_S0	Grant County PUD Purchase Power Contract.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P60_S0	On February 27, 2014, Grant County PUD discovered a sixty-five foot long, two inch wide crack in a spillway pier at its Wanapum Development Project.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S0	PSE is party to a purchased power contract with Grant County PUD, pursuant to which PSE takes 0.64% of the output from the project and pays a proportional share of the operating cost of the project.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S1	Grant County PUD has lowered the reservoir level 26 feet below normal to begin repairs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S2	Interim repairs were completed in November 2014 and the reservoir was raised 16 feet on December 1, 2014, still 10 feet below normal.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S3	This condition will remain into the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S4	The Chelan County PUD Rock Island Project, which is upstream from the Wanapum Development Project, is still impacted, but is expected to run on a more regular basis.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S5	The engineering assessment of the crack repairs, required to restore the project to normal operations, has been developed and is expected to be completed near the end of April 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S6	The impact to power costs is estimated to be $2.6 million over the next 30 years, our proportionate share of the estimated $60.0 million cost to mitigate this condition.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P61_S7	All additional power cost increases are subject to the Company s PCA mechanism sharing bands.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P62_S0	The Company is actively engaged in monitoring the development of the commercial markets for such intangible power attributes as renewable energy credits and carbon financial instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P62_S1	The Company supports the development of regional and national markets for these products that are open, transparent and liquid.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P63_S0	The contract between PSE and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 (IBEW) expired on March 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P63_S1	There are approximately 850 PSE employees represented by the IBEW who perform work in customer service, electric operations and energy production.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P63_S2	After more than a year of negotiations, a new contract was ratified by the IBEW on December 11, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P63_S3	It is effective through March 31, 2017.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P64_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P64_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P64_S2	Set forth below are the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_15_ITEM7_P65_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P66_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude (or include) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P67_S0	The presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P68_S0	Electric margin and gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P68_S1	PSE s electric margin and gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and gas margin measures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P68_S2	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P69_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2014 to 2013 and periods 2013 to 2012 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P70_S0	Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P71_S0	______________ As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P72_S0	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P72_S1	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P73_S0	Electric margin increased $0.5 million and $60.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P73_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact electric operating revenue and electric energy costs which are included in electric margin:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P74_S0	2014 compared to 2013 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues decreased $73.1 million , or 3.4% , to $2,083.8 million from $2,156.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P74_S1	Operating revenue decreased $73.1 million primarily due to lower residential sales of $76.9 million , lower other retail sales of $57.8 million and lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $12.8 million , partially offset by increased decoupling revenue and other operating revenue of $46.3 million and $28.1 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P74_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S0	Electric retail sales decreased $135.6 million , or 6.5% , to $1,955.4 million from $2,091.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S1	Electric retail sales decreased due to a net revenue decrease of $72.5 million, primarily due to the Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) gain of $51.8 million, which was refunded to customers in December 2014, PCORC rate decreases effective December 1, 2014 of $19.4 million annually, or 0.9%, and effective November 1, 2013 of $10.5 million annually, or 0.5%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S2	In addition, retail revenue decreased $63.1 million due to lower retail electricity usage of 640,076 MWhs, or 3.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S3	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S4	The decrease was primarily due to lower wholesale electricity prices which decreased revenue by $3.2 million and a decrease in sales volume of 296,295 MWhs, or 17.6%, which decreased revenue $9.6 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S5	Decoupling revenue resulted in an additional $31.3 million of revenue as a result of decoupling for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to lower volumetric revenues compared to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S6	This is compared to a decrease of $15.0 million in decoupling revenue in the same period in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P75_S7	The decoupling receivable will be recovered from customers through a future rate filing beginning May 1, 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P76_S0	Other electric operating revenue increased $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P76_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2014 , other electric operating revenues increased primarily due to non-core gas sales of $13.5 million and biogas revenues of $10.5 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P77_S0	Electric Energy Costs Purchased electricity expense decreased $27.8 million , or 5.1% , for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P77_S1	The decrease in purchased electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of a decrease of $17.8 million due to a market price offset and a $6.6 million decrease in long-term firm purchases and market purchases for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P77_S2	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P77_S3	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short term and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P78_S0	Residential exchange credits increased $48.0 million , or 59.2% , for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 resulting from higher Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P78_S1	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P79_S0	2013 compared to 2012 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $28.7 million, or 1.3%, to $2,156.9 million from $2,128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P79_S1	Operating revenue increased $28.7 million primarily due to higher sales to other utilities and marketers of $30.7 million and higher miscellaneous other operating revenue of $23.4 million offset by decoupling revenue over-collection of $15.0 million and lower electric retail sales of $9.4 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P79_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S0	Electric retail sales decreased $9.4 million, or 0.4%, to $2,091.0 million from $2,100.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S1	Electric retail sales decreased due to a net revenue decrease of $16.4 million, primarily due to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff which passes through to customers the benefits of federal income tax incentives with no impact on earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S2	The offset is recorded in amortization expense and federal tax expense.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S3	The decrease was offset by the electric rate increase of 3.2% effective May 14, 2012, the expedited rate filing and the decoupling rate increase of 2.5% which became effective July 1, 2013 and various other pass-through tariff items that have no impact on earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S4	The decrease was offset by a net revenue increase of $6.9 million due to higher retail electricity usage of 69,719 MWhs, or 0.3%, primarily due to higher usage by its commercial and industrial electric customers for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S5	Sales to other utilities and marketers increased $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S6	The increase was primarily due to an increase in wholesale electricity prices which increased revenue by $25.7 million and an increase in sales volume of 297,973 MWhs, or 21.4%, which increased revenue $5.1 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S7	Decoupling revenue resulted in a decrease of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to higher volumetric revenues over the decoupled revenues per customer under the decoupling mechanism effective July1, 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P80_S8	The offset is recorded in regulatory liability which will be passed back to customers through a rate filing beginning May 1, 2014 over a 12-month period.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P81_S0	Other electric operating revenue increased $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P81_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2013, other electric operating revenues increased primarily due to lower losses on non-core gas sales of $16.0 million and higher transmission revenue of $7.1 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P82_S0	Electric Energy Costs Purchased electricity expense decreased $80.4 million, or 12.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P82_S1	The decrease in purchased electricity expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily the result of a $102.4 million decrease in long-term firm purchases and market purchases.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P82_S2	This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $9.4 million due to a market price offset and increase of $7.7 million in transmission expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P83_S0	To meet customer demand, PSE economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil-fuel generation, owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long-term contracted power.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P83_S1	However, depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy, plant availability, fuel prices and/or changing load as a result of weather, PSE may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P83_S2	PSE manages its regulated power portfolio through short-term and intermediate-term off-system physical purchases and sales as well as through other risk management techniques.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P84_S0	Electric generation fuel expense increased $56.4 million, or 27.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P84_S1	The increase was primarily due to a $48.3 million increase in fuel expense at PSE's combustion turbine facilities primarily resulting from an increase in electric generation at combustion turbine facilities of 2,735,066 MWhs, or 104.4%, as compared to the same period in 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P84_S2	Also contributing to the increase was a $9.8 million increase in fuel expense at PSE's Colstrip Unit 1 2 primarily due to the two plants which were taken offline in 2012 for maintenance for an extended period and reintroduced into production when it was more economical to generate energy at a later point in time.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P84_S3	The increase was offset by a decrease of $1.7 million in fuel expense at Colstrip Unit 3 4 primarily due to Unit 4, which was shut down for repair and maintenance starting July 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P84_S4	Unit 4 returned to service in February 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P85_S0	Residential exchange credits increased $7.5 million, or 10.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 as a result of higher REP tariff prices associated with the BPA REP.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P86_S0	The following table displays the details of PSE s natural gas margin changes from 2014 to 2013 and 2013 to 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P87_S0	Gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P88_S0	___________________ As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P88_S1	Gas margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operations and maintenance expense.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P88_S2	Percent change not applicable or meaningful.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P89_S0	Natural gas margin increased $14.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and decreased $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P89_S1	Following is a discussion of significant items that impact gas operating revenue and gas energy costs which are included in natural gas margin:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P90_S0	2014 compared to 2013 Gas Operating Revenue Gas operating revenue decreased $15.5 million , or 1.5% , to $1,012.9 million from $1,028.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P90_S1	The decrease in gas operating revenue of $15.5 million was due primarily to lower natural gas retail sales revenue of $52.4 million as a result of lower natural gas costs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P90_S2	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S0	Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased $52.4 million , or 5.2% , to $950.9 million from $1,003.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S1	The decrease in natural gas retail sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 was primarily due to a decrease of $76.1 million, or 7.6%, in natural gas therm sales.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S2	In addition, decreases in PSE's decoupling rate of $1.0 million, or 0.1% annually, effective May1, 2014, and PGA rate reduction of $19.9 million, or 2.1% annually, effective November 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S3	Decoupling revenue resulted in an additional $31.3 million of revenue as a result of decoupling for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to lower volumetric revenues compared to the allowed decoupled revenue per customer.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S4	This is compared to a decrease of $5.2 million of revenue in the same period in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P91_S5	The decoupling receivable will be recovered from customers through a future filing beginning May 1, 2015.

1085392_15_ITEM7_P128_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures may be funded from a combination of sources which may include cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P128_S1	PSE s planned capital expenditures may result in a level of spending that exceeds its cash flow from operations.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P128_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s strategy is dependent in part on continued access to capital markets.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P129_S0	Puget Sound Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $68.1 million from $835.7 million generated during the same period in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P129_S1	The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in regulatory assets and liabilities of $155.8 million and a $142.8 million decrease related to other long term liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P129_S2	Offsetting this decrease in cash flow was a $190.3 million cash inflow related to accounts receivable.

1085392_15_ITEM7_P130_S1	The net decrease was negatively impacted by $68.1 million from cash provided by the operating activities of PSE, as previously discussed.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P130_S2	The above decrease was negatively impacted by Puget Energy's $15.4 million cash outflow related to interest.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P131_S0	Financing Program The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P131_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P131_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P132_S0	Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.

1085392_15_ITEM7_P142_S0	Term Loans In June 2014, Puget Energy entered into three bilateral term loans, with two and three year maturities, which in total, equal $299.0 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P142_S1	The proceeds of the term loans were used to pay off the outstanding Puget Energy revolving credit facility balance, which subsequently allows the Company to carry the debt with lower interest expense.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P142_S2	All other terms, conditions and covenants are consistent with each other and the credit facility agreements, with the exception of maturity and price.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P143_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P143_S1	At December 31, 2014 , approximately $438.4 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2014 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.3 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facility.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S6	At December 31, 2014 , the EBITDA to interest expense was 3.1 to one for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P144_S7	At December 31, 2014 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	Debt Restrictive Covenants The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P146_S1	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2014 , PSE could issue:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P147_S0	Approximately $367.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $611.7 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P147_S1	At December 31, 2014 , PSE had approximately $6.9 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P148_S0	Upon approval of the merger in 2009, the Company was required to refinance its debt in place at the time of the merger.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Company has met this refinancing requirement as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P149_S0	Shelf Registrations and Long-Term Debt Activity Puget Sound Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P149_S1	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, up to $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by pledged first mortgage bonds.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P149_S2	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P150_S0	And Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P151_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P152_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P152_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P153_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, PSE's electric and gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P153_S1	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P153_S2	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P154_S0	As defined by ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P154_S1	PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P154_S2	Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted, the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the WUTC that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P154_S3	PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P155_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and the FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980 ASC 980.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P157_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P157_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2014 in the amount of $987.4 million and $635.4 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2013 of $895.7 million and $697.5 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P157_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P158_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P159_S0	determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P160_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P160_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P161_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Electric Regulation and Rates within Item 1.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	Business Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customers' bills through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P163_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P164_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P164_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P165_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P165_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P166_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P167_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P168_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P169_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P169_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P169_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P169_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P170_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P170_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S2	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $4.4 billion at the October 1, 2014 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S3	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.6 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 22.0% or $801.0 million.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S4	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S5	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 2.9% and 7.0%, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P171_S6	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_15_ITEM7_P172_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P172_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P172_S2	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the NPNS exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P173_S0	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P174_S0	to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P175_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P175_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S1	On 2009, Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S2	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S3	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S4	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P176_S5	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P177_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P177_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P177_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P178_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P179_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P179_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P180_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P180_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_15_ITEM7_P181_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P181_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P181_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P182_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P183_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $13.8 million , $22.4 million and $14.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P183_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 61.5%, 60.8% and 57.2% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P183_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $12.8 million and $16.5 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P183_S4	In 2015 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $23.3 million and incremental qualified pension income of $16.6 million, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.9 million , $5.7 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.6 million and $0.7 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S3	In 2015 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $5.6 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S4	PSE has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S5	PSE recognized income of $0.4 million and expense of $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S6	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.3 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S7	In 2015 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.1 million and incremental expense of $0.3 million, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S8	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P184_S9	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S4	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S5	During 2014 , the Company made a cash contribution of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S6	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S7	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company s qualified pension plan was $64.0 million underfunded and $42.4 million over-funded as measured under GAAP, or 90.7% and 107.4% funded, respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S8	As of January 1, 2015 , the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P185_S9	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2015 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $4.4 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 5.10% in 2013 to 4.25% in 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P186_S1	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense increased from 4.15% in 2013 to 5.10% in 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P186_S2	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2014 remained unchanged at 2013 level, or 7.75% .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P186_S3	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits increased from 6.90% in 2013 to 7.00% in 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios and related effects.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	PSE's natural gas retail customers are served by natural gas purchase contracts which expose PSE's customers to commodity price risks through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	All purchased natural gas costs are recovered through customer rates with no direct impact on PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P2_S3	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	The forward physical electric contracts are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P4_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 91% of these contracts, including NPNS transactions, are entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the Company had total assets of $24.3 million and total liabilities of $196.0 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P7_S4	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $25.7 million .
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2014 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P13_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P13_S2	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P13_S3	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P13_S4	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P14_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P14_S2	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P14_S3	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE held approximately $1.0 billion in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had 11 counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P16_S1	Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P16_S2	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P16_S3	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P17_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P18_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA or NAESB).
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P18_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P18_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P18_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P19_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P20_S0	used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P21_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P21_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P21_S2	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P21_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P22_S1	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P23_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P23_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P23_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P23_S4	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's debt instruments:
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P24_S0	For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Notes 6 and 10 under Item 8.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P25_S0	From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P25_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2014 was a net loss of $6.0 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P25_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $6.3 million in OCI as of December 31, 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S2	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S4	At December 31, 2014 , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $9.1 million pre-tax loss.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S5	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S6	Currently, all changes in market value are recorded in earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S7	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of Puget Energy's interest rate swaps by $0.8 million .
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P26_S8	The following table presents the fair value of Puget Energy s interest rate swaps:
1085392_15_ITEM7A_P27_S0	The change in fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 is summarized in the table below:

1085392_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Basis of Presentation Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings), owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiary, PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P34_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $231.7 million , $243.9 million and $244.2 million for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, PSE's electric and gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Revenues associated with power costs under the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism and Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Utility Plant Puget Energy and PSE capitalize, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P38_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P38_S2	Replacements of minor items of property are included in maintenance expense.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P38_S3	When the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	Planned Major Maintenance Planned major maintenance is an activity that typically occurs when PSE overhauls or substantially upgrades various systems and equipment on its natural gas fired combustion turbines on a scheduled basis.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	Costs related to planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major maintenance.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P39_S2	This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	Non-Utility Property, Plant and Equipment For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P40_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P40_S2	Replacement of minor items are expensed on a current basis.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired are reflected in earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Depreciation and Amortization For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P42_S2	The depreciation of vehicles and equipment is allocated to the asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	depreciable gas utility plant was 3.4% , 3.4% and 3.4% in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively; and depreciable common utility plant was 8.5% , 11.4% and 11.6% in 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	The decrease in depreciable common utility plant that occurred between 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to asset retirement.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P44_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P45_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P50_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P50_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P50_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2014 using an October 1, 2014 measurement date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P53_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P53_S2	Changes in these estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P53_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P53_S4	There were no known events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2014 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	The cash and cash equivalents balance at Puget Energy was $37.5 million and $44.3 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P54_S2	The 2014 and 2013 balance consisted of cash equivalents, which are reported at cost and approximate fair value, and were $1.8 million and $2.6 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Fuel and Gas Inventory Fuel and gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P56_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P56_S2	Gas inventory consists of natural gas and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P56_S3	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P57_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term due to the length of the amortization.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	For further details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 3.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending principally upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P60_S2	The AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility plant additions based on the effective dates are as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P61_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P61_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	The non-utility subsidiary recognizes revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	Sales of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, PSE's electric and gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P66_S3	The decoupling mechanism reduces earnings volatility, but does not materially affect the timing of cash flow due to the timing difference between the recognition of decoupling revenue and resulting impacts on rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P67_S3	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $7.5 million and $7.4 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	Self-Insurance PSE is self-insured for storm damage and environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	In addition, PSE is required to meet a deductible for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P70_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P71_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE provides natural gas to its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P72_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P72_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	PSE records the benefit of the PTCs as a regulatory liability until such time as PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	Once utilized, PSE will pass the benefit to customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S2	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting in 2009.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S3	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S4	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S5	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S6	As a result, the Company will continue to experience the earnings impact of these reversals from OCI in future periods.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P76_S7	When these contracts are settled, the contract price becomes part of purchased electricity or electric generation fuel which becomes part of PSE s PCA mechanism and the unrealized gain or loss is listed separately under energy costs, as it represents the non-rate treatment of energy costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding related to its long-term debt.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P77_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	As permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P78_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 Fair Value Measurements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P80_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The following tables set forth the components of the Company s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", that outlines a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P83_S1	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	Early adoption of the ASU is not permitted.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P84_S3	The Company initiated a steering committee and project team to evaluate the impact of this standard, update any policies and procedures that may be affected and implement the new revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P84_S4	At this time, the Company cannot determine the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	As part of FASB's initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards, it issued ASU 2015-01, which eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Currently, Subtopic 225-20 requires an entity to separately classify, present and disclose extraordinary events and transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	ASU 2015-01 will align GAAP income statement presentation guidance with International Accounting Standards 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, which prohibits the presentation and disclosure of extraordinary items.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S3	ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Company is permitted to apply amendments prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S5	Early adoption is permitted, provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P85_S6	At this time, the Company doesn't expect this standard to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	Below is a chart with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and the associated time periods:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 included the following:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Commission rate proceeding.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P88_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805 as a result of the merger.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P90_S2	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $313.1 million and $269.5 million in 2014 and 2013 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P90_S3	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Washington Commission issued a general rate case order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	In 2014 and 2013 , PSE incurred $29.7 million and $9.4 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $18.0 million was deferred in 2014 and no amount was deferred in 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), a limited-scope proceeding, was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six -month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11 -month timeline for a general rate case.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	On October 23, 2013, the Washington Commission approved an update on the Company's PCORC, effective November 1, 2013, which reflected decreases in the overall normalized power supply costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	This resulted in an estimated revenue decrease of $10.5 million or 0.5% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	On November 3, 2014 the Washington Commission issued an order on the settlement of the PCORC which PSE filed on May 23, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S3	The original filing proposed a decrease of $9.6 million (or an average of approximately 0.5% ) in the Company's overall power supply costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S4	PSE filed joint testimony supporting a settlement stipulation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P93_S5	Customer rates decreased by approximately $19.4 million or 0.90% annually, as a result of the settlement, effective December 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	Electric Rate Case On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P94_S1	The rate change incorporated the effects of an increase to the allowed delivery revenue per customer as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P94_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric of $10.6 million , or 0.5% annually, and a rate decrease for natural gas of $1.0 million , or 0.1% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas property tax tracker mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	property taxes paid as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P96_S1	This represents a rate increase for electric of $11.0 million , or 0.5% annually, and a rate increase for natural gas of $5.6 million , or 0.6% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P96_S2	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission also approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas conservation riders, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P96_S3	The rate change incorporated the effects of changes in the annual conservation budgets as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P96_S4	The rate change represents a rate increase for electric of $12.2 million , or 0.5% annually, and a rate increase for natural gas of $0.3 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	On November 3, 2014 the Washington Commission approved PSE's 2014 PCORC.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P97_S1	The original filing proposed a decrease of $9.6 million (or an average of approximately 0.5% ) in the Company's overall power supply costs with an effective date of December 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P97_S2	PSE filed joint testimony supporting a settlement stipulation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P97_S3	Customer rates decreased by approximately $19.4 million or 0.90% as a result of the settlement, effective December 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism and expedited rate filing (ERF) tariff filings, effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the decoupling mechanism for electric is an increase of $21.4 million , or 1.0% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the ERF filings for electric is an increase of $30.7 million , or 1.5% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S3	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S4	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S5	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P98_S6	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial reviews of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P99_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P99_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter were held on May 9, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P99_S3	On June 25, 2014, the court issued a letter decision in which it affirmed the attrition adjustment (escalating factors referred to as the K-Factor) and the Washington Commission's decision not to consider the case as a general rate case, but reversed and remanded the cost of equity for further adjudication consistent with the court's decision.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P99_S4	As a result, there will be evidentiary proceedings regarding Return on Equity (ROE) in February 2015 with an order anticipated in the first half of 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's electric general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for electric customers of $63.3 million or 3.2% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	The rate increases for electric customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S3	PSE's requested treatment of the prepayments made to Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), filed in May 2010, was approved in the order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S4	The final order rejected PSE's proposed conservation savings adjustment.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S5	Finally, a new rate rider for RECs was proposed by settlement of electric parties and approved by the Washington Commission in the final order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P100_S6	The following table sets forth electric rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	In addition, PSE will be increasing the allowed delivery revenue per customer under the decoupling filing by 3.0% for electric customers on January 1 of each year until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	Accounting Orders and Petitions On November 27, 2013, the Washington Commission issued an order authorizing PSE to provide the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas supply produced from a landfill-gas recovery project in King County (Biogas) prior to October 31, 2013 as a bill credit to customers over a one-year period in its RECs adjusting price schedule which became effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	Additionally, the Washington Commission order authorized that all net proceeds from Biogas produced after October 31, 2013 plus the internal labor needed to obtain the net proceeds is reflected as a PSE below-the-line item (i.e., not included in the revenues and expenses considered when setting electric customer rates) and excluded from utility operations.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	PSE completed the sale of its electric infrastructure assets located in Jefferson County and the transition of electrical services in the county to JPUD on March 31, 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S3	The proceeds from the sale exceeded the transferred assets' net carrying value of $46.7 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $60.0 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S4	In its 2010 order on the subject, the Washington Commission stated that PSE must file an accounting and ratemaking petition with the Washington Commission to determine how this gain will be allocated between customers and shareholders.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S5	As a result, the gain was deferred and recorded as a regulatory liability pending the Washington Commission's determination of the accounting and ratemaking treatment.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S6	On October 31, 2013, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that would authorize PSE to retain the gain of $45.0 million and return $15.0 million to its remaining customers over a period of 48 months.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S7	On March 28, 2014, intervenors filed response testimonies containing their respective proposals for allocation of the gain, which included a proposal of up to $57.0 million to customers and $3.0 million to PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S8	A final order was rendered on September 11, 2014 authorizing PSE to retain $7.5 million of the gain and return $52.7 million to customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S9	The customer portion is booked to a regulatory liability account in other current liabilities and accruing interest at PSE's after-tax rate of return.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S10	PSE and the parties to the case filed a joint motion to amend the final order to allow for the customer portion to be paid to customers through a bill credit in the month of December 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P102_S11	The Commission granted the joint motion on October 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	PCA Mechanism In 2002, the Washington Commission approved a PCA mechanism that provides for a rate adjustment process if PSE s costs to provide customers electricity vary from a baseline power cost rate established in a rate proceeding.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	All significant variable power supply cost variables (hydroelectric and wind generation, market price for purchased power and surplus power, natural gas and coal fuel price, generation unit forced outage risk and transmission cost) are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The PCA mechanism apportions increases or decreases in power costs, on a calendar year basis, between PSE and its customers on a graduated scale.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P104_S1	The graduated scale is as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	Treasury Grant Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (Section 1603) authorizes the United States Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) to make grants (Treasury Grants) to taxpayers who place specified energy property in service provided certain conditions are met.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	Section 1603 precludes a recipient from claiming PTCs on property for which a grant is claimed.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	PSE received two treasury grants with a total amount of $107.9 million , related to Baker and Snoqualmie hydro facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P106_S1	These grants have been accounted as a reduction to utility plant and will be amortized over the life of the plant based on the Washington Commission authorization.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	The Wild Horse Wind Project (Wild Horse) expansion facility was placed into service on November 9, 2009.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P107_S1	The capacity of the Wild Horse facility was expanded from 229 megawatts (MW) to 273 MW through the addition of wind turbines.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	In February 2010, the U.S. Treasury approved a Treasury Grant of $28.7 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P108_S1	The 343 MW Lower Snake River facility was placed into service on February 29, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P108_S2	In December 2012, the U.S. Treasury approved a Treasury Grant of $205.3 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P108_S3	On February 29, 2012, PSE filed proposed tariff revisions, with stated effective dates of April 1, 2012, and subsequently revised by filing on March 29, 2012 with stated effective dates of June 1, 2012, to pass-through $2.4 million in interest on the unamortized balance of the Wild Horse Expansion Treasury Grant.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P108_S4	On June 26, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's methods and calculations and new rates became effective on July 3, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	On January 31, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a rate change to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective February 1, 2013, which incorporated the effects of the Treasury Grant related to the Lower Snake River wind generation project and keeping the ten year amortization period and inclusion of interest on the unamortized balance of the grants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P109_S1	The rate change passed through 11 months of amortization for both grants to eligible customers over 11 months beginning February 1, 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P109_S2	Of the total credit, $34.6 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $23.8 million represents the pass through of interest.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P109_S3	This represents an overall average rate decrease of 2.8% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	On December 27, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to the PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $58.5 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P110_S2	Of the total credit, $37.8 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $20.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2013 rate period.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P110_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.3% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	Gas Regulation and Rates Gas General Rate Cases and Other Filings Affecting Rates On May 7, 2012, the Washington Commission issued its order in PSE's natural gas general rate case filed in June 2011, approving a general rate increase for natural gas customers of $13.4 million , or 1.3% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The rate increases for natural gas customers became effective May 14, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P111_S2	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	On June 1, 2012, PSE filed with the Washington Commission a petition seeking an Accounting Order authorizing PSE to change the existing natural gas conservation tracker mechanism into a rider mechanism to be consistent with the electric conservation program recovery.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	The accounting petition requested the ability to recover the costs associated with the Company's current gas conservation programs via transfers from amounts deferred for the over-recovery of commodity costs in the Company's PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	The Commission granted PSE's accounting petition on June 28, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P112_S3	The approved accounting petition resulted in an increase to gas conservation revenues of $6.9 million and an increase to conservation amortization expense of $6.6 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism and ERF tariff filings, effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P113_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the decoupling mechanism for natural gas is an increase of $10.8 million , or 1.1% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P113_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the ERF filings for natural gas is a decrease of $2.0 million , or a decrease of 0.2% annually.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P113_S3	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.8% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P113_S4	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a series of settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P114_S1	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P114_S2	As a result, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism and will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial review of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	The parties' petition argues that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter were held on May 9, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P115_S3	On June 25, 2014, the court issued a letter decision in which it affirmed the attrition adjustment K-Factor and the Washington Commission's decision not to consider the case as a general rate case, but reversed and remanded the cost of equity for further adjudication consistent with the court's decision.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P115_S4	As a result, there will be evidentiary proceedings regarding ROE in February 2015 with an order anticipated in the first half of 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism in retail natural gas rates to recover variations in natural gas supply and transportation costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	Variations in natural gas rates are passed through to customers; therefore, PSE s net income is not affected by such variations.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P116_S2	Changes in the PGA rates affect PSE s revenue, but do not impact net operating income as the changes to revenue are offset by increased or decreased purchased gas and gas transportation costs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	On October 30, 2014, the Washington Commission approved the PGA natural gas tariff which proposed to reflect changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The impact of PGA rates is an annual revenue decrease of $23.3 million , or 2.5% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	On October 30, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff, effective on November 1, 2013, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is an increase of $4.0 million , or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	On October 31, 2012, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing and allowed the rates to go into effect on November 1, 2012 on a temporary basis subject to revision.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	On May 1, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the proposed rates and allowed them to be made permanent.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P121_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the approved change is a decrease of $77.0 million , or 7.7% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P122_S0	The following table sets forth natural gas rate adjustments that were approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact to PSE s annual revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P123_S0	In addition, PSE will be increasing the allowed delivery revenue per customer under the decoupling filing by 2.2% for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P125_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P125_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P126_S0	During 1992, the Washington Commission issued orders regarding the treatment of costs incurred by the Company for certain sites under its environmental remediation program.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P126_S1	The orders authorize the Company to accumulate and defer prudently incurred cleanup costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P128_S0	Per the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly basis.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $35.4 million for gas and $5.7 million for electric.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S1	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S2	The Company is also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and Bellingham, Washington.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S3	The Company has taken the lead for both projects.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company s share of future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $25.2 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S5	The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are $13.4 million , $12.3 million , and $10.9 million at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P129_S6	The Company's deferred natural gas environmental costs are $52.6 million , $45.1 million , and $66.4 million at December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P130_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P130_S1	At December 31, 2014 , approximately $438.4 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S0	Beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2014 , and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.3 to one for the twelve months then ended.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S5	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P131_S6	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.1 to one for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 .

1085392_15_ITEM8_P134_S1	The following table describes all changes to the Company s ARO liability:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2014 due to:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P136_S0	A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P137_S0	An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P138_S0	An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P138_S1	The major transmission lines are expected to be used indefinitely; therefore, the liability cannot be reasonably estimated.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P139_S0	A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground fuel storage tanks.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P140_S0	An obligation to pay decommissioning costs at the end of utility service franchise agreements to restore the surface of the franchise area.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P141_S0	A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if FERC orders the project to be decommissioned, although PSE contends that FERC does not have such authority.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P141_S1	Given the value of ongoing generation, flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and cannot be reasonably estimated.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P142_S0	____________ Puget Western, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PSE, Promissory Note.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P143_S0	PSE's senior secured notes will cease to be secured by the pledged first mortgage bonds on the date that all of the first mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under the electric or natural gas utility mortgage indenture have been retired.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P144_S3	To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE s earnings available for interest must exceed certain minimums as defined in the indentures.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P144_S4	At December 31, 2014 , the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P145_S0	Puget Sound Energy Pollution Control Bonds PSE has two series of Pollution Control Bonds (the Bonds) outstanding.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P145_S1	Amounts outstanding were borrowed from the City of Forsyth, Montana who obtained the funds from the sale of Customized Pollution Control Refunding Bonds issued to finance pollution control facilities at Colstrip Units 3 4.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P145_S2	In May 2013, PSE refinanced $161.9 million of the Bonds to a lower weighted average interest rate from 5.01% to 3.91% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P145_S3	The Bonds will mature on March 1, 2031.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P145_S5	Due to the refinance of the Bonds, Puget Energy wrote off $18.0 million of fair value related to the Bonds that were redeemed to interest expense.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P146_S0	Each series of the Bonds is collateralized by a pledge of PSE s first mortgage bonds, the terms of which match those of the Bonds.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P146_S1	No payment is due with respect to the related series of first mortgage bonds so long as payment is made on the Bonds.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P147_S0	Puget Energy Long-Term Debt At the time of the merger in 2009, Puget Energy entered into a $1.225 billion five -year term-loan and a $1.0 billion five -year capital expenditure credit facility for funding capital expenditures.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P147_S1	In February 2012, Puget Energy entered into a $1.0 billion five -year revolving senior secured credit facility and the 2009 term loan and capital expenditure facilities were terminated.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P147_S2	Concurrent with the closing of the new PSE credit facilities in February 2013, the Company reduced the size of Puget Energy's credit facility to $800.0 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P147_S3	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .

1085392_15_ITEM8_P147_S5	All other terms and conditions of that facility remain unchanged from when it was committed in 2012 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P148_S0	As a revolving facility, amounts borrowed may be repaid without a reduction in the size of the facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P149_S1	The agreement also contains a financial covenant based on the Maximum Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P150_S0	In June 2014, Puget Energy entered into three bilateral term loans, with two and three year maturities, which in total, equal $299 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P150_S1	The proceeds of the term loans were used to pay off the outstanding Puget Energy revolving credit facility balance, which subsequently allows the Company to carry the debt with lower interest expense.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P150_S2	All other terms, conditions and covenants are consistent with each other and the credit facility agreement, with the exception of maturity and price.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P151_S0	The principal amounts of long-term debt maturities for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P152_S0	Financial Covenants Puget Energy's credit facility contains a financial covenant related to maximum leverage.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P152_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company is in compliance with its long-term debt financial covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P153_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , PSE had $85.0 million and $162.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P153_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P153_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2014 and 2013 was 4.05% and 3.93% , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P153_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P154_S0	Puget Sound Energy Credit Facilities PSE has two unsecured revolving credit facilities which provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P154_S1	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P154_S2	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P154_S3	The credit facilities also have an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P154_S4	In April 2014, the Company completed a one-year extension on both of the liquidity and hedging facilities, extending the maturity from February 2018 to April 2019, and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facilities from when they were committed in 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P155_S0	The credit agreements are syndicated among numerous lenders and contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to transact with affiliates, make asset dispositions and investments or permit liens to exist.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P155_S1	The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P155_S2	PSE certifies its compliance with such covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P155_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenant ratios.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S0	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S1	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S2	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S3	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S4	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.25% and the commitment fee is 0.175% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S5	As of December 31, 2014 , no amounts were drawn and outstanding under PSE's liquidity facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S6	No amounts were drawn and outstanding under the $350.0 million energy hedging facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S7	No letters of credit were outstanding under either facility, and $85.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P156_S8	Outside of the credit agreements, PSE had a $4.2 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P157_S0	Demand Promissory Note In 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P157_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P157_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P157_S3	At December 31, 2014 , the outstanding balance of the Note was $28.9 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P157_S4	The outstanding balance and the related interest under the Note are eliminated by Puget Energy upon consolidation of PSE s financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P158_S0	At December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P158_S1	In April, 2014, the Company completed an amendment to the senior secured credit facility, extending the maturity from February 2017 to April 2018, updating the fee structure, eliminating a financial covenant and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P158_S2	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P158_S3	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P158_S4	Interest rates may be based on the bank's prime rate or LIBOR plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P159_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P159_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , there was no amount drawn and outstanding under the facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P159_S2	As a result of Puget Energy's credit rating upgrade in 2014, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.28% as of the date of this report.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P160_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility or similar variable rate debt.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P161_S1	The agreement also contains a Maximum Leverage Ratio financial covenant as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P161_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P162_S1	Certain leases contain purchase options, renewal options and escalation provisions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P162_S2	Operating lease expenses net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	Payments received for the subleases of properties were immaterial for each of the years ended 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P163_S1	Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts are:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P164_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P164_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and PSE's related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P165_S1	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P165_S2	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P165_S3	The forward physical electric agreements are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P166_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P167_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P167_S2	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P167_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding which extend to January 2017 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P167_S4	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	The following table presents the volumes, fair values and locations of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	___________ Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	Interest rate swap contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P170_S1	PSE had a net derivative liability and an offsetting regulatory asset of $69.3 million at December 31, 2014 and $27.6 million at December 31, 2013 related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P170_S2	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P171_S0	For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 10.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P172_S0	It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level, without offsetting assets or liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts; ISDA agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and NAESB agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P172_S2	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	The following tables present the potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative assets and liabilities:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P175_S0	All Derivative Contract deals are executed under ISDA, NAESB and WSPP Master Netting Agreements with Right of Offset.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P175_S1	Interest Rate Swap Contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	Due to the merger in 2009, Puget Energy recorded all derivative contracts at fair value as either assets or liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	Certain contracts meeting the criteria defined in ASC 815 were subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges, thereby causing differences in the derivative unrealized gains/losses to be recorded through earnings between Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P176_S2	These differences will occur through February 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	The following tables present the effect and locations of the Company's derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, recorded on the statements of income:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	___________ For 2012 , the amount differs from the amount stated in the statement of income as it does not include amortization related to contracts that were recorded at fair value at the time of the February 2009 merger and subsequently designated as NPNS of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P179_S0	The unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts is reported in the statement of cash flows under the operating activities section.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P179_S1	However, at the time of the merger in 2009, all derivative contracts at Puget Energy were assessed to identify contracts that have a more than an insignificant fair value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P179_S2	If the fair value was greater than 10% of the notional value, the contract was deemed as having a financing element.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P179_S3	For those contracts, the cash inflows (outflows) are presented in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P179_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , cash outflows related to financing activities of $16.3 million , $34.3 million and $92.7 million , respectively, were reported on Puget Energy's statement of cash flows.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	For derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges (including both commodity and interest rate swap contracts), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was recorded as a component of OCI, and then is reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P180_S1	Puget Energy and PSE expect $0.5 million and $1.1 million of losses, respectively, in accumulated OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P180_S2	The Company does not attempt cash flow hedging for any new transactions and records all mark-to-market adjustments through earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following tables present the Company's pre-tax gain (loss) on derivatives that were previously in a cash flow hedge relationship, and subsequently reclassified out of accumulated OCI into income:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P183_S2	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial distress.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P183_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P183_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P184_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P184_S2	However, as of December 31, 2014 , approximately 99.3% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 0.7% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P184_S3	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P184_S4	As the Company generally enters into transactions using the WSPP, ISDA and NAESB master agreements, it believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because they provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments and, in the event of counterparty default, termination payments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty (i.e., WSPP, ISDA, or NAESB).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P185_S1	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P185_S2	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P185_S3	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P186_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P186_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P187_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P187_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P188_S0	Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P188_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P189_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P189_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P189_S2	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P190_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company's derivative activity at December 31, 2014 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P191_S0	__________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P191_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P192_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P192_S1	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in the forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P193_S0	ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P193_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P193_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P194_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P194_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P194_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P195_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P196_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P196_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P197_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P198_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P198_S1	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P199_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P199_S2	Inputs used to estimate the fair value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and discount factors.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P199_S3	Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P200_S0	Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P201_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	For interest rate swaps, the Company obtains monthly mark-to-market values from an independent external pricing service for LIBOR forward rates, which is a significant input.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P201_S2	Some of the inputs of the interest rate swap valuations, which are less significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties, assumptions for time value and the impact of the Company's nonperformance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash as Level 1 financial instruments due to cash being at stated value, and cash equivalents at quoted market prices.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	The Company considers its electric, natural gas and interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	Management's assessment was based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices (e.g., Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	However, certain energy derivative instruments with maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P205_S0	The following table presents the carrying value for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable and short-term debt by level, within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P205_S1	The carrying values below are representative of fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P206_S0	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P206_S1	Carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P207_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P208_S0	_______________ Income Statement location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P208_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $(9.6) million , $(13.4) million , and $(15.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P208_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P209_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P209_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P210_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P211_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P211_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P212_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P212_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P213_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P213_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2014 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P214_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P215_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P215_S1	Consequently significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P216_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P217_S0	At December 31, 2014 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $3.9 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P218_S0	At the time of merger, Puget Energy recorded the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P218_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P218_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P220_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P221_S0	At December 31, 2014 , Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test of its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P221_S1	The valuation indicated a fair value of $437.6 million with an impairment to the Wells hydro contract.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P221_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the carrying value for this contract was $65.3 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was $62.1 million , thereby requiring a write-down of $3.2 million to this intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P221_S3	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the impaired long term power purchase contract's fair value on December 31, 2014 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	At June 30, 2013 , Puget Energy completed a valuation and impairment test of its purchased power contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P222_S1	The valuation indicated a fair value of $484.1 million with an impairment to the Priest Rapids Reasonable Portion intangible asset contract.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P222_S2	As of June 30, 2013 , the carrying value for this intangible asset contract was $47.1 million and its fair value on a discounted basis was determined to be an asset of $33.6 million , thereby requiring a write-down of $13.5 million to the intangible asset with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory liability.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the impaired long term power purchase contract's fair value on June 30, 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	The valuations were measured using the income approach.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P224_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract pricing which provided future net cash flow estimates which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P224_S2	A less significant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company's Investment Plan is a qualified employee 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P225_S1	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $14.9 million , $14.6 million and $14.5 million for the years 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P226_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P226_S1	Non-represented employees and United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (UA) represented employees hired before January 1, 2014, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 (IBEW) represented employees hired before December 12, 2014, have the following company contributions:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P227_S0	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P228_S0	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55% of an employee s contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P229_S0	UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 will have access to the 401k Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P229_S1	Non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will have access to the 401(k) plan and will choose how they want to accumulate funds for retirement, with two contribution sources from PSE:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P230_S0	401(k) Company Matching: New non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive company match each paycheck based on a new schedule- 100% match on the first 3% of pay contributed and 50% match on the next 3% of pay contributed.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P230_S1	An employee who contributes 6% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P230_S2	Company matching will be immediately vested.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P231_S0	Company Contribution: New UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P231_S1	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Retirement Plan (Cash Balance retirement plan).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P231_S2	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P231_S3	The Company s 4% contribution will vest after three years of service.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P232_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all PSE employees.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P232_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary, years of service and, in the case of employees in the cash balance formula plan, the applicable annual interest crediting rates.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P232_S2	Beginning in 2014, all new UA employees and those new non-represented employees who elect to accumulate the Company contribution in the Cash Balance pension, (effective January 1, 2014) and all new IBEW (effective December 12, 2014), will receive annual pay credits of 4% each year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P232_S3	They will also receive interest credits like other participants in the Cash Balance pension, which are at least 1% per quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P233_S0	When a newly-hired employee with a vested Cash Balance benefit leaves PSE, he or she will have annuity and lump sum options for distribution, with annuities calculated according to the Pension Protection Act.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P233_S1	Those who select the lump sum option will receive their current cash balance amount.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P233_S2	Participation by continuing employees in the Cash Balance pension plan is not affected.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S0	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S1	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides group health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S2	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S3	The insurance premiums, paid primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S4	The 2009 merger of Puget Energy with Puget Holdings triggered a new basis of accounting for PSE s retirement benefit plans in the Puget Energy consolidated financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S5	Such purchase accounting adjustments associated with the re-measurement of the retirement plans are recorded at Puget Energy.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P234_S6	The following tables summarize the Company s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets and amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P235_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's pension benefit amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P236_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and Puget Sound Energy's net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P237_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and Puget Sound Energy's benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S0	The estimated prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 by Puget Energy is $3.9 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S1	The estimated net (loss) gain for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 is $1.6 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S2	The estimated prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 is immaterial .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S3	The estimated net (loss) gain, prior service cost (credit) and transition (obligation) asset for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 are immaterial .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S4	The estimated net (loss) gain and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 by Puget Sound Energy are $20.5 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S5	The estimated net loss (gain) and prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 are $2.1 million .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S6	The estimated prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 is immaterial .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S7	The estimated net (loss) gain for the other postretirement plan that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2015 is $0.3 million and prior service cost (credit) and transition (obligation) asset for the other postretirement plans are immaterial.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P238_S8	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the qualified pension plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2015 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $4.4 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P239_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P240_S0	_______________ The Company calculates the present value of the pension liability using a discount rate of 4.25% which represents the single-rate equivalent of the AA rated corporate bond yield curve.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P241_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 6.70% in 2015 grading down to 4.30% in 2016 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P241_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P242_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P242_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P243_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P243_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P243_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P243_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P244_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P244_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P245_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P245_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P245_S2	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P245_S3	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P246_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid under the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P247_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P247_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P248_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P248_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P249_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P250_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P251_S0	Plan Fair Value Measurements ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P251_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P252_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P252_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P253_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_15_ITEM8_P254_S0	_________________ Non US Equity investments are comprised of a (1) mutual fund; and a (2) commingled fund.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P257_S0	The tactical asset allocation investment is comprised of a commingled fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of the measurement date.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P258_S0	Fixed income securities consist of a mutual fund.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P258_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued using quoted market prices multiplied by the number of shares owned as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P259_S0	As of December 31, 2014 absolute return investments consist of two partnerships.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P259_S1	The partnerships are valued using the financial reports as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P259_S2	These investments are a Level 3 under ASC 820 because the significant valuation inputs are primarily internal to the partnerships with little third party involvement.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P260_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund, which is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_15_ITEM8_P260_S1	The money market fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P261_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value:
1085392_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P269_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_15_ITEM8_P269_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P269_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P269_S3	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P269_S4	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2026 through 2034.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P271_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P272_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P272_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P273_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P273_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P275_S1	One claim relates to the alleged failure to update the Title V permit to reflect the major modifications alleged in the first thirty-six claim, another claim alleges that the previous Title V compliance certifications have been incomplete because they did not address the alleged major modifications, and the last claim alleges opacity violations since 2007.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P276_S0	The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District of Montana, Billings Division, requesting injunctive relief and civil penalties, including a request that the owners remediate environmental damage and that $100,000 of the civil penalties be used for beneficial mitigation projects.

1085392_15_ITEM8_P283_S1	The transportation and storage contracts, which have remaining terms from less than one year to 30 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual usage.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P283_S2	The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery obligation to ensure service to PSE s customers and generation requirements.
1085392_15_ITEM8_P284_S0	The Company incurred demand charges in 2014 for firm transportation service and firm storage and peaking service of $155.0 million and $6.6 million , respectively.

1085392_15_ITEM11_P1_S0	Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P2_S0	For 2014, the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were: Kimberly J. Harris, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO); Daniel A. Doyle, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO); Paul M. Wiegand, Senior Vice President, Energy Operations; Marla D. Mellies, Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer; and Steve R. Secrist, Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P3_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P4_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P4_S1	Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of Company goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P5_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P5_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of its executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (Cook Co.).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P5_S2	The Committee recommends to the full Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Cook Co., and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P5_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P6_S0	In 2014, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P7_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P7_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P7_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets base salary and target total direct compensation (the sum of base salary and annual and long-term incentive target award opportunities) to the 50th percentile of the market data.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P7_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P7_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P9_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P10_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P10_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P12_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P13_S0	Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P13_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P13_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P13_S3	Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P13_S4	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P14_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P14_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P14_S2	Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P15_S0	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group and to drive the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P15_S1	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P15_S2	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P15_S3	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2014 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P16_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness To help inform the Committee s recommendations on base salary, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive programs, for 2014 compensation the Committee reviewed both market data obtained from industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation benchmarking peer group.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P16_S1	The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Towers Watson 2013 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P16_S2	The list of the 22 companies comprising the custom market survey cut used to inform compensation decisions for 2014 is:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P17_S0	As noted, the market survey data were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 15 companies, many of which overlapped with companies included in the market survey data.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P17_S1	The resulting median revenue of the executive compensation peers was $3.4 billion, which is comparable to PSE s annual revenues of $3.1 billion at the time the peer group was developed.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P17_S2	The peer companies that comprised the Company s executive compensation benchmarking peer group to inform 2014 compensation decisions are shown below:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P18_S0	Alliant Energy NiSource Portland General Electric 2.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P18_S1	Great Plains Energy NV Energy Vectren 4.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P18_S2	Integrys Energy Group Pepco Holdings Westar Energy 5.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P19_S0	As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of industry practice, with deviations by individual executive as described below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P19_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, actual compensation is expected to be below this targeted level and if Company performance significantly exceeds target, actual compensation is expected to be above this targeted level.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P20_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P20_S1	Despite the median philosophy, the Company may choose to target an executive s compensation above or below the 50th percentile of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P20_S2	In addition to the foregoing survey data, the Committee generally also received advice from Cook Co. in connection with 2014 compensation decisions.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P21_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P22_S0	percentile of the comparator group and are reviewed annually by the Committee on an individual basis using as a guideline, the 50th percentile salary levels of our comparator group, as well as internal pay equity among our executives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P22_S1	Actual salaries vary by individual and depend on additional factors, such as an individual s expertise, level of performance achievement, level of experience and level of contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P23_S0	Base Salary Adjustments for 2014 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2014 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P23_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries as shown in the table below, and base salaries for 2014 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P23_S2	Effective March 1, 2014, the Board increased the base salary of Ms. Harris, President and CEO, from $875,000 to $900,000.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P23_S3	In establishing the salary amount for Ms. Harris, the Committee recommended and the Board approved a base salary that continued to be slightly below the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P23_S4	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were in a range of 2% to 5%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P24_S0	2014 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P24_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P25_S0	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P25_S1	For 2014, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against 9 SQIs covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P25_S2	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P25_S3	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P25_S4	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards .
1085392_15_ITEM11_P26_S0	In 2014, to continue emphasizing the Company's commitment to employee safety, the Company retained a safety performance measure in the annual incentive plan funding.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P26_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the 9 SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P26_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P27_S0	The safety performance measure contains four targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P27_S1	The four targets for 2014 were:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P28_S0	All employees attend a monthly safety meeting in a box presentation, or complete the same content online.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P28_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95%.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P29_S0	All employees complete two classes on safety, disaster preparedness, or wellness, choosing from in person or on-line courses.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P29_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95% for all new hires.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P30_S0	The Company Total Incident Case Rate (TICR) not to exceed a rate of 1.40 in 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P30_S1	The Company Lost Workday Case Rate (LWCR) not to exceed a rate of 0.29 in 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P31_S0	In 2014, 100% funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all 9 SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P31_S1	In total, all 10 customer service and safety measures were met or deemed met.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P32_S0	Funding levels at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P33_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not exclude any items for 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P34_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on a subjective evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P35_S0	2014 Corporate Goals In 2014, the Company introduced the Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) to summarize for employees the direction and overall goals of the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P35_S1	The plan has five objectives which capture our 2014 goals and which have been communicated to our employees as shown below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P35_S2	Each employee, including the Named Executive Officers, has specific goals linked to driving strategies that meet one or more of the objectives:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P36_S0	Safety -- Our Safety Objective is our foundation: If Nobody Gets Hurt Today, we will feel safe and secure and be able to perform at our best.

1085392_15_ITEM11_P41_S0	2014 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2014 was at 99% of target for EBITDA, and at target for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P41_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,146.4 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 10 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2014 of 95.2% under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P42_S0	For 2014, individual target incentive levels for this plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2014 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the individual executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P42_S1	Target annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for participating executives remained unchanged from 2013 levels except for Mr. Secrist, who was promoted to Senior Vice President.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P42_S2	In connection with Mr. Secrist s promotion, the Board approved an increase in his 2014 target award opportunity from 40% to 45% of base salary.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P42_S3	The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P43_S0	As described above, an executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on a subjective assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P43_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met or exceeded by each executive, small adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of the Named Executive Officers other than the CEO in 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P43_S2	The Committee similarly recommended an award amount for the CEO which included a small adjustment for individual performance in 2014 and to recognize that the Company nearly met 2014 annual incentive goals at target.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P43_S3	The adjustments for individual performance did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2014 achievement of the corporate goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P43_S4	The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below, which were paid in March 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P44_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P44_S1	Long-term incentive plan (LTI Plan) awards are denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P45_S0	Performance measures are based on two financial goals, total return (Total Return) and Return on Equity (ROE), measured over a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P46_S0	Total return reflects the annual change in the value of the Company plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P47_S0	Achievement of one performance measure during the performance cycle is evaluated independently of the other.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P48_S0	The Committee annually approves a targeted LTI grant value for each executive, which is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P48_S1	The target LTI grant value is then converted into a target number of units, allocated equally among the two financial goals, based on the unit value on the grant date.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P48_S2	The per-unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings level and is calculated annually by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P48_S3	The number of units ultimately earned may range from 0% to 200% of target depending on performance, with the payout being made in cash based on the number of units earned and the per-unit value at the end of the performance period.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P48_S4	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P49_S0	The Committee determines the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating long-term incentive grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P49_S1	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when granting annual incentive awards or making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P49_S2	Half of the target units are earned based on Total Return and the other half are earned based on ROE, each over a 3-year performance period.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P49_S3	These metrics and weightings have remained unchanged since the 2012 - 2014 grant.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P50_S0	2014-2016 LTI Plan Target Awards and Performance Goals Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2014-2016 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P50_S1	Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2014-2016 performance cycle were 170% of base salary for Ms. Harris and 95% for Mr. Doyle, Mr. Wiegand, Ms. Mellies and Mr. Secrist, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2013-2015 performance cycle, except for Mr. Secrist.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P50_S2	Mr. Secrist s target award was increased from 50% to 95% as a result of his promotion during 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P51_S0	The total number of LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer for the 2014-2016 performance cycle is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $41.25, as adjusted as described below under Total Return Model Corrections.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P51_S1	Details of the number of units granted and expected values at target, threshold and maximum performance levels can be found in the 2014 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P52_S0	Effective February 27, 2015, the Board approved an increase in LTI target for Ms. Harris from 170% to 200% of base salary effective with the 2015-2017 LTI grant.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P52_S1	Targets for the other Named Executive Officers were not changed.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P53_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P53_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P54_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P54_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S0	The Company uses an internally managed financial model to track and forecast Total Return, a key measure in the LTI Plan, and periodically reviews the assumptions within the model.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S1	This financial model is provided as an input to the independent valuation firm which determines Total Return for the calculation of LTI Plan awards, subject to Board approval.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S2	During 2012 and again in 2014, certain model inputs were adjusted with Board approval, and these changes impacted the 2012 and 2014 calculations of Total Return achieved.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S3	LTI grant payments in 2012 and 2013 were not impacted, as the performance threshold was not met.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S4	The adjustments to Total Return, if they had been implemented in the model prior to the 2012-2014 LTI cycle, would have resulted in changes to the initial unit prices for the 2012-14, 2013-15, and 2014-16 LTI performance cycles.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S5	In 2014, the Board approved the model changes and approved adjusted initial performance unit prices for each of the 2012-14, 2013-15 and 2014-16 LTI performance cycles.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S6	To preserve the same initial grant value to each executive, the Board approved corresponding adjustments to the number of units granted to each executive in each of the foregoing performance cycles.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P55_S7	The Board took this action because it believes that LTI Plan participants should not be penalized or benefit from these changes which did not reflect differences in actual performance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P56_S0	The table below summarizes the initial performance unit grants and the adjusted grants (rounded to whole units), each of which provided identical grant value to the executive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P56_S1	As a result, this adjustment had a neutral economic effect under the LTI Plan for outstanding performance cycles.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P57_S0	LTI Plan Performance 2012-2014 Performance Cycle The 2012-2014 performance cycle has now ended.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P58_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the table below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P58_S1	Units granted have been adjusted as described above.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P59_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the combined three-year average was a compounded annual rate of 7.59%, below the three-year average target but above the threshold needed for payment.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P59_S1	The Total Return Component funded at 51.8% of target units.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P60_S0	Performance on the ROE Component of the grant was an average of target plus 15.7 basis points for funding at 106.27% of target units.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P61_S0	The table below summarizes the status of the two other outstanding performance cycles from the initial grant date to December 31, 2014, with the projected payout assuming this same performance for the full three-year cycle (the payout scales for Total Return and ROE above also apply to both of these grants):
1085392_15_ITEM11_P62_S0	The Company maintains the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P62_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P63_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P63_S1	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2014 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P64_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P64_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P64_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P65_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P65_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P65_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2014 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P66_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company) and Mr. Secrist (who was not then an officer), which amended and restated then existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the executives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P66_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provided for an employment period of two years following the completion of a merger and otherwise generally provide severance benefits similar to those under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P66_S2	Since 2009, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P67_S0	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P67_S1	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the current arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P68_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services, business club memberships and executive physicals up to an annual limit.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for individual personal use of club facilities.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P69_S8	Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P70_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P71_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value incentive opportunity for annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target level award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P71_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P72_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P73_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P74_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P74_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P75_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for achievement of Company goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P75_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P75_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P75_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P76_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P76_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P76_S2	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P76_S3	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P77_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P78_S0	The following information is provided for the year ended December 31, 2014 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P78_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Mr. Wiegand and Ms. Mellies are executives of PSE only.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P78_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P79_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P80_S0	___________________ For 2014, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2014 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2012-2014 performance cycle.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P80_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2015 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P80_S2	The 2014 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2015.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P81_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P81_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P81_S2	In 2014, low interest rates and improved mortality assumptions have increased the actuarial value of the underlying retirement benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P81_S3	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2014 Pension Benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P81_S4	The change in pension value amounts for 2014 are: Ms. Harris, $2,331,156; Mr. Doyle, $336,575; Mr. Wiegand, $367,992; Ms. Mellies, $388,644; and Mr. Secrist, $621,610.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P82_S0	Also included in this column are the portions of Deferred Compensation Plan earnings that are considered above market.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P82_S1	These amounts for 2014 are: Ms. Harris, $2,190; Mr. Doyle, $0; Mr. Wiegand, $2,466; Ms. Mellies, $306; and Mr. Secrist $0.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P82_S2	See the 2014 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table for all Deferred Compensation Plan earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P82_S3	All Other Compensation for 2014 is shown in detail in the table below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P83_S0	Ms. Harris was promoted to President and CEO from President on March 1, 2011.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P83_S1	Mr. Doyle joined PSE and Puget Energy as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on November 28, 2011.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P84_S0	_______________ After an initial reimbursement up to $7,500, annual reimbursement for financial planning, tax planning, and/or legal planning, up to a maximum of $5,000 for Ms. Harris and $2,500 for the other Named Executive Officers.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P84_S1	This column also includes club use which is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P84_S2	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P85_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P86_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2014 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P87_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2014-2016 performance cycle were equally allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P87_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings during the three-year performance cycle, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P88_S0	2014 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P88_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P89_S0	using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P89_S1	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P90_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P90_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2014 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are 4.0% for 2014 and are assumed to be 4.0% through 2019, and 5.0% annually thereafter.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S2	The discount assumption is 4.25%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2015 417(e) unisex mortality table adjusted to reflect RP-2014 with MP-2014 improvements.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S3	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of % 1.15%, 4.06%, and 5.15% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2014).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S4	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S5	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2013 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2013.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S6	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0% annual through 2017 and 5.0% annually thereafter, a discount assumption of 5.10% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2014 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S7	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.37%, 4.05% and 5.06% (the 24 month average of the underlying rates as of September 2013).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P91_S8	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2013 were the same as those used for December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P92_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P92_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P93_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P93_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Mr. Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S3	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014 will receive pay credits equal to 4% (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S4	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S5	For 2014, the limit was $260,000.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S6	For 2015, the limit is $265,000.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S7	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S8	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S9	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P94_S10	For 2014 and 2015, the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S4	This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P95_S7	As of December 31, 2014, all the Named Executive Officers were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P96_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P96_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P97_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P97_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P97_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P97_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P97_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P98_S0	If a participant in the cash balance portion of the Retirement Plan dies while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates, then his or her Retirement Plan benefit will be immediately vested.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P98_S1	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P98_S2	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S2	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S3	However, SERP participants as of December 31, 2014, who had not yet attained age 55 at that date, including Ms. Harris, Ms. Mellies, and Mr. Secrist, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S4	All the participating Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P99_S5	However, Ms. Harris must continue Company service through December 31, 2016 in order to vest additional SERP benefit value after December 31, 2012.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P100_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a Named Executive Officer (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below: (1) One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P100_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P100_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P101_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P101_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P101_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P102_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P102_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P103_S0	(2) The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P103_S1	(3) The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P103_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2014 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S4	An executive may also elect to have his or her SERP benefit transferred to the Deferred Compensation Plan and paid in accordance with his or her elections under that plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S5	An executive may elect to have his or her SERP benefit paid, or commence to be paid, upon termination of employment after attaining age 55 but prior to attaining age 62.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S6	The SERP benefit of any executive who receives such early retirement benefits will be reduced by 1/3% for each month that the early commencement date precedes the beginning of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the executive attains age 62.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S7	Mr. Wiegand is the only Named Executive Officers eligible for early retirement benefit payments under the SERP as of December 31, 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S8	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S9	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S10	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P104_S11	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P105_S0	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding aggregate executive and Company contributions and aggregate earnings for 2014 and year-end account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S0	_______________ The amount in this column reflects elective deferrals by the executive of salary, annual incentive compensation or LTI Plan awards paid in 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S1	Deferred salary amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $23,806; Mr. Wiegand, $18,316; Ms. Mellies, $7,318; and Mr. Secrist, $0.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S2	Deferred incentive compensation amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $0; Mr. Wiegand, $0; Ms. Mellies, $0; and Mr. Secrist $0.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S3	The amounts are also included in the applicable column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S4	The amount reported in this column reflects contributions by PSE consisting of the annual investment plan restoration amount and annual cash balance restoration amount described below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S5	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S6	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P106_S7	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2014.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P107_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P107_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P107_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P107_S3	The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P107_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P108_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P108_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P108_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P108_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P108_S4	The 2014 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P109_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P109_S1	Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P110_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P111_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P112_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P112_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P112_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P112_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P113_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P113_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P113_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P113_S3	Mr. Wiegand is the only Named Executive Officer currently retirement eligible under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P114_S0	Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) an involuntary termination without cause or by the executive for good reason not in connection with a change in control; (ii) a change in control; (iii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iv) retirement; (v) disability; or (vi) death.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P115_S0	Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P115_S1	In addition, each Named Executive Officer, other than Mr. Doyle and Mr. Secrist, entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with the Company in March 2009, which provides for benefits or payments upon certain qualifying terminations of employment from the Company following a change in control.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P115_S2	The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, described below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P116_S0	Disability and Life Insurance Plans If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P116_S1	These disability and life insurance amounts are not reflected in the table below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P116_S2	The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P116_S3	The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65% of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P116_S4	The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P117_S0	LTI Plan Awards If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P117_S1	In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based on performance through the prior year.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P117_S2	In the event of a change in control, outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change of control.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P118_S0	Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers In March 2009, PSE entered into Executive Employment Agreements (Employment Agreements) with each of the Named Executive Officers except Mr. Doyle and Mr. Secrist (collectively, individual parties to such Employment Agreements, the Covered Executives), the terms of which are the same for all the Covered Executives and which amended and restated then existing Amended and Restated Change of Control Agreements between the Company and each of the Covered Executives.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P118_S1	The Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following completion of a merger, and generally provides benefits similar to those provided under the previous Change of Control Agreements.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P118_S2	In the event of a termination of employment within two years of a change in control (a Covered Termination), a Covered Executive is eligible to receive the payments described below.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P119_S0	outstanding immediately after such acquisition (other than through a registered public offering) or (ii) all or substantially all of the Company s assets.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P120_S0	Payments upon Involuntary Termination without Cause or for Good Reason If a Covered Executive s employment is terminated without cause by the Company or is terminated by the Covered Executive for good reason within two years of a change in control, the Covered Executive is eligible to receive the following compensation and benefits:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P121_S0	Pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs (Annual Bonus).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P122_S0	Continued group medical, dental, disability and life insurance benefits to the Covered Executive and his or her family for the remainder of the two-year protection period.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P122_S1	Benefits will be paid by the Company while the Covered Executive is eligible for COBRA and thereafter by reimbursement of payments made by the Covered Executive for such coverage (including related tax amounts), except that if the Covered Executive becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits under the Employment Agreement will become secondary to those provided by the other employer (the foregoing benefit is referred to as Health and Welfare Benefit Continuation).
1085392_15_ITEM11_P123_S0	Under the Employment Agreements, cause and good reason have the following meanings:
1085392_15_ITEM11_P124_S0	Cause generally means (i) the willful and continued failure by the Covered Executive to substantially perform the Covered Executive s duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 30 days after written notice of demand for substantial performance has been delivered to the Covered Executive or (ii) the Covered Executive s willfully engaging in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, as determined by the Board after notice to the executive and opportunity for a hearing.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P124_S1	No act or failure to act on the Covered Executive s part is considered willful unless the Covered Executive has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that the Covered Executive s action or failure to act was in the best interests of the Company.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P125_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P126_S0	Payments upon Retirement, Disability or Death In the event of a Covered Termination due to voluntary retirement after having attained age 55 with a minimum of five years of service to the Company, a pro-rated Annual Bonus is payable to the Covered Executive.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P126_S1	The bonus is payable at the time the Covered Executive otherwise would have received the payment had employment continued, based on the Company s actual achievement of performance goals.
1085392_15_ITEM11_P126_S2	In the event of a Covered Termination due to disability or death, the Covered Executive is eligible to receive the following compensation and benefits: Pro-rated Annual Bonus; and Health and Welfare Benefit Continuation.

1085392_15_ITEM13_P0_S0	Transactions with Related Persons Our Boards of Directors have adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of related person transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P0_S1	Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P1_S0	A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction reported to the Chief Compliance Officer will be reviewed according to the following procedures:
1085392_15_ITEM13_P3_S0	If the Chief Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P4_S0	If disclosure is required, the Chief Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P4_S1	The Chair is authorized to approve or ratify any related person transaction involving an aggregate amount of less than $1.0 million or when it would be impracticable to wait for the next Audit Committee meeting to review the transaction.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P5_S0	If the transaction is outside the Chair s authority, the Chair will submit the transaction to the Audit Committee for review and approval or ratification.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P6_S0	When determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Chair of the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee, as applicable, will review relevant facts regarding the related person transaction, including:
1085392_15_ITEM13_P7_S0	Whether the related person transaction is consistent with the best interests of the Company.

1085392_15_ITEM13_P12_S0	Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Independence of the Board The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P12_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, Steven Hooper (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Mary McWilliams (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Melanie Dressel (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), and Herbert Simon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P13_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P13_S1	The Company s definition of Independent Director is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P14_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P14_S1	The Board has also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P14_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P14_S3	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P15_S0	Messrs, Hooper and Simon, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P15_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P15_S2	In addition, PSE has entered into transactions with entities for whom Mr. Simon serves as a director, or in which he otherwise has a financial interest, that involve amounts that are less than the greater of $1.0 million or 1% of those entities consolidated gross revenue.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P15_S3	These transactions fall within the second categorical standard described above.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P15_S4	Because these relationships either fall within the Board s categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P16_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_15_ITEM13_P16_S1	Ms. Dressel, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.

1085392_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	GENERAL Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	All of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P0_S2	Puget Energy has no significant assets other than the stock of PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	All of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Corporate Strategy Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	Customers and Revenue Overview PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P4_S1	The following tables present the number of PSE customers and revenue by customer class for electric and natural gas as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P5_S2	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P5_S3	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently often higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and subsequently lower power costs in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P5_S4	While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	Capital Expenditures In the five-year period ended December 31, 2015 , PSE s gross electric utility plant additions were $3.4 billion and retirements were $424.5 million .
1085392_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	In the same five-year period, PSE s gross natural gas utility plant additions were $748.4 million and retirements were $100.0 million and PSE s gross common utility plant additions were $360.6 million and retirements were $228.3 million .
1085392_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	Gross electric utility plant at December 31, 2015 was approximately $9.6 billion , which consisted of 36.0% distribution, 41.1% generation, 14.1% transmission and 8.8% general plant and other.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	Gross natural gas utility plant at December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.4 billion , which consisted of 93.0% distribution and 7.0% general plant and other.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	Gross common utility general and intangible plant at December 31, 2015 was approximately $548.7 million .
1085392_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	Employees At December 31, 2015 , PSE had approximately 2,800 full-time employees.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	Approximately 1,100 PSE employees are represented by the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	The current contracts with the UA and the IBEW expire on September 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	Puget Energy does not have any employees.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE's employees provide employment services to Puget Energy and charges for their related salaries and benefits at cost.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	Segment Information Puget Energy operates one reportable business segment referred to as the regulated utility segment.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	For more information on this segment, see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Corporate Location PSE s and Puget Energy's principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Item 10 Part III of this annual report.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	REGULATION AND RATES PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (1) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (2) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the NERC, the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, which standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S2	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S3	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S4	In addition, the rate plan increased allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs which will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next general rate case (GRC), which will be filed before April 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P15_S5	In the rate plan, rate increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of total revenue for customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	Order No. 8 in the TransAlta Centralia proceeding granted in part and denied in part PSE's Petition for Reconsideration, clarifying certain portions of the Washington Commission's original order regarding TransAlta Centralia.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	Rate mechanisms include: (1) trackers that typically track costs regarding a single specific costs during the previous 12-month period, and: (2) riders that project cost recovery during a forward looking 12-month period.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	Both allow rapid recovery of an expenditure without the lengthy process of a full GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to eliminate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	The energy supply costs, which are part of the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) and Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanisms are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers during the following May to April time period.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	The allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	The decoupling mechanism will end on February 28, 2017 unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in PSE s next GRC filing which PSE is required to file by April 1, 2016 at the latest.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	On April 22, 2015, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	As part of this filing, PSE also requested to change the methodology of how decoupling deferrals are calculated going forward and adjust deferrals calculated in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	The change was requested, approved and implemented to eliminate the amortization of prior years accumulated decoupling deferrals from the calculation of the current year decoupling deferrals.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	The effect of the methodology change was a reduction of approximately $12.0 million previously recognized revenue from May through December of 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	As noted earlier, the Company is also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	This limitation was triggered for certain rate classes.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P21_S2	The resulting amount of deferral that was not included in the 2015 rate increase is $1.9 million for electric revenue and $8.2 million for natural gas revenue that was accrued through December 31, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	The rate change incorporated the effects of an increase to the allowed delivery revenue per customer as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric customers of $10.6 million , or 0.5% annually, and a rate decrease for natural gas customers of $1.0 million , or 0.1% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S3	In addition, PSE exceeded the earnings test threshold for its natural gas business in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S4	As a result, PSE recorded a reduction in natural gas decoupling deferral and revenue of $1.3 million.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P22_S5	This was reflected as a reduction to the natural gas rate increases noted above.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The customers share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12-month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Electric Rate Filings Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The Federal Incentive tracker tariff passes the benefits associated with treasury grants received by the company and production tax credits available through to its customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	The filing results in a credit back to customers of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P24_S2	The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P24_S3	The following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline included in revenue requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	The power cost baseline is set in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	The graduated scale currently applicable is as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	The settlement agreement will not take effect until January 1, 2017.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	Key components of the settlement will result in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues as part of the next GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA/PCORC.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	PSE had an unfavorable PCA imbalance during the year ended December 31, 2015 , due to under recovering $8.7 million of power costs that exceeded the power cost baseline level of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P30_S1	This compares to an unfavorable imbalance of $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 of which $10.1 million was apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case A limited-scope proceeding was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P31_S3	The following table sets forth PCORC rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates for inclusion in the tracker mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the actual amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	Natural Gas Rate Filings Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P34_S2	A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an underrecovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P34_S3	The following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	The purpose of the Cost Recovery Mechanism (CRM) is to recover depreciation expense and return on the investment in the Company's pipeline replacement program to enhance the safety of the natural gas distribution system until included in base rates for gas service.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P35_S1	The following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P36_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates for inclusion in the tracker mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P36_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the actual amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P36_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P36_S4	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	For additional information on electric and natural gas rates, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	_______________ Includes amortization of prior year collection/refund, reduction related to excess rate of return, and a reduction related to amounts that will not be collected within 24 months.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	_______________ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Average Megawatt (aMW) usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	ELECTRIC SUPPLY At December 31, 2015 , PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,887 megawatts (MW).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P42_S2	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	At December 31, 2015 , PSE owns the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 3,575 MW:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	_______________ Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts During 2015 , approximately 13.9% of PSE s energy supply requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P45_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P45_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P46_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P46_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P47_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) (for 44 aMW of capacity), and with Pacific Gas Electric Company (for 300 MW of capacity).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P47_S1	PSE expects to participate in an Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator (ISO) effective October 1, 2016, which is expected to reduce costs for PSE customers, enhance system reliability, integrate variable energy resources, and leverage geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S0	PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S1	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S2	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S3	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S4	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S5	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S6	In 2015 , PSE had 4,646 MW and 695 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P48_S7	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P49_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	During 2015 , approximately 77% of natural gas purchased for the power portfolio originated in Canada and 23% originated in the United States.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P51_S1	The 2015 IRP was filed on November 30, 2015 and identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2015 IRP.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	In 2015, PSE renewed all the Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) transmission available for renewal during the year to meet peak capacity needs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	PSE projects that beginning in 2021 its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The IRP identifies declining regional surpluses, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P53_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P54_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale market, subject to the sharing bands of the PCA mechanism, at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P55_S0	_____________ Includes amortization of prior year collection/refund, reduction related to excess rate of return, and a reduction related to amounts that will not be collected within 24 months.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P56_S0	NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P56_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P57_S0	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P57_S1	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P58_S0	_______________ All peak firm gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P59_S0	For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P59_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s gas system.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s liquefied natural gas (LNG) peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S4	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S5	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P60_S6	During 2015 , approximately 57.0% of natural gas purchased by PSE for its natural gas customers originated in British Columbia, 24.0% originated in Alberta and 19.0% originated in the United States.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P61_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P61_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P61_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S2	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S3	Of this total, PSE holds 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers, which represents nearly 44% of PSE's expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S4	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S5	Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 641,000 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P62_S6	In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P63_S1	PSE holds over 12.8 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of two and four years and has rights to extend such agreements.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P63_S2	PSE has temporarily released a portion of its Clay Basin storage services to third parties, and its net storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin is 8.9 million Dth and over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P64_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P64_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S0	During 2014, PSE, working with NWP determined that the pipeline redelivery service to PSE from NWP s Plymouth LNG facility could no longer be considered firm during peak conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S1	As a result, PSE terminated the service agreement effective October 31, 2015 and removed the resource from its natural gas firm portfolio.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S2	In 2015, PSE and NWP negotiated a new contract for Plymouth LNG service for PSE s generation fleet, which provides for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S3	PSE will use the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S4	In addition, PSE acquired 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity for the generation fleet.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P65_S5	The balance of the LNG capacity will be delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE s generation fleet.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P66_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P66_S1	This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system, however, it is temporarily not in-service pending planned environmental, safety, efficiency and reliability upgrades.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P67_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P68_S0	Natural Gas Transportation Capacity PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Spectra's Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P68_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S1	PSE holds approximately 539,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S2	In addition, PSE holds approximately 453,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S3	PSE holds approximately 253,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S4	In addition PSE holds over 34,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S5	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from one to 29 years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P69_S6	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P70_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is 130,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to four years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P71_S0	for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P72_S0	PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to eight years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P72_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 40,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of five to eight years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P72_S2	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of eight years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P72_S3	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of five to eight years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S3	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S4	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P73_S5	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S0	ENERGY EFFICIENCY PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S3	PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S4	However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P74_S5	To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2013 from the Washington Commission for electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P75_S0	Since 1997, PSE has recovered direct electric energy efficiency (or conservation) expenditures through an electric rider mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P75_S1	To recover natural gas expenditures, from 1997 to 2011, PSE used a tracker mechanism, which recovered actual natural gas expenditures in the year following the year in which the expenditures were incurred.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P75_S2	In 2012, the Washington Commission directed PSE to convert natural gas expenditure recovery to a rider mechanism, consistent with the electric expenditure recovery methodology.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P75_S3	The rider mechanism allows PSE to defer the efficiency expenditures and amortize them to expense as PSE collects them in rates over a one-year period.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P76_S0	ENVIRONMENT PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P76_S1	The primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs include:
1085392_16_ITEM1_P77_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of a coal plant in Colstrip, Montana coal-fired steam electric generation facility (Colstrip), Montana.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P77_S1	All these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P77_S2	This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P77_S3	PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P78_S0	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P79_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P80_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P80_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P81_S0	of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P82_S0	Remediation PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P82_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P83_S0	The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P83_S1	PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P83_S2	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P84_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P84_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal), and dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P85_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P85_S1	This includes most generation facilities (and all those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P86_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P86_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P87_S0	RECENT AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND REGULATION Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P87_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P87_S2	Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P88_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P88_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P88_S2	As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P88_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P88_S4	PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P89_S0	PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting Each year, PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P89_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P89_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P89_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P90_S0	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2014 were 9.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P90_S1	Approximately 41.4% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.1 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P90_S2	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an important part of the existing diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P90_S3	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S0	On January 8, 2014, the EPA issued a proposed New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S1	The EPA first proposed a NSPS for emissions for CO 2 from new power plants in April 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S2	However, after more than 2.5 million comments on the original proposal, the EPA decided that a new approach was warranted and rescinded the April 2012 proposal.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S3	The EPA is currently proposing an emissions limit for coal-fired sources of 1,100 lb.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S4	CO 2 /MWh, and proposes standards for natural gas combined cycle sources from 1,000 to 1,100 lb.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P91_S5	CO 2 /MWh depending on the size and type of unit.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S0	Under the January 8, 2014 NSPS proposal, the Agency concluded that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been adequately demonstrated as a technology for controlling CO 2 emissions in full-scale commercial applications at coal-fired electrical generating units (EGUs), while reaching the opposite conclusion, that CCS is not adequately demonstrated, in the case of gas-fired generators.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S1	PSE submitted comments by the end of the comment period on May 9, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S2	On August 3, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule combining its new and modified proposals into one rulemaking and making several changes.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S3	The rule was published on October 23, 2015, and separates standards for new power plants fueled by natural gas and coal.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S4	New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S5	of CO 2 /MWh which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S6	New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S7	of CO 2 /MWh, which is less stringent than the draft rule.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S8	The standard for coal plants would not specifically require CCS but CCS was reaffirmed by the EPA as the best system of emission reductions (BSER).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P92_S9	These 111(b) standards are implemented by the states, but states do not have much flexibility to alter the standards set by the EPA.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P93_S0	On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed a rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act for the control of CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P93_S1	The proposed rule was estimated by the EPA to reduce total power sector carbon emissions 30% from 2005 levels by 2030 through the setting of individual emissions targets for each state.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S0	The EPA applied its BSER approach for reducing CO 2 emissions from the electric power sector, consisting of increasing the efficiency of power generation and substituting higher emitting plants with lower emitting technologies.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S1	The EPA announced the final rule for 111(d), the Clean Power Plan rule, on August 3, 2015 and published it on October 23, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S2	The rule included several changes from the draft rule.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S3	Specifically, the EPA excluded energy efficiency from one of four "building blocks" identified in the draft rule, leaving just three building blocks (i) increased efficiency for coal plants, (ii) greater utilization of natural gas plants and (iii) increased renewable sources.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S4	In the final rule, the EPA provided more flexibility in achieving interim goals by phasing in the reduction and giving states the option to set their own interim compliance glide path and pushing the start of compliance to 2022.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S5	The EPA also adjusted the 2012 baseline to address hydroelectricity variability and provided specific CO 2 mass targets by year for each state.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S6	States have broad flexibility to pick a rate-based or mass-based approach and can design compliance options and decide how to allocate credits and whether to allow trading.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S7	The EPA also gave states the option of seeking additional time, if necessary, to formulate a state plan.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S8	States must submit something within one year but can request up to an additional two years for development of a state plan.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S9	Thus, states must submit a plan for implementing CO 2 reductions to the EPA one to three years following issuance of the final rule.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S10	Based on the October 2015 final version of the rule, the final CO 2 goal for Montana became 26% more stringent than the draft version and the final CO 2 goal for Washington became 35% less stringent.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S11	By 2030 Montana must reduce CO 2 emissions from coal plants from 20.5 million tons of CO 2 to 11.3 million tons of CO 2 which is a 45% reduction in CO 2 emissions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P94_S12	For reference, Colstrip Units 1, 2, 3 and 4 combined emit 18 million tons of CO 2 .
1085392_16_ITEM1_P95_S0	On January 6, 2016 the Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) published a draft Clean Air Rule that establishes GHG emission reduction standards for certain stationary sources, petroleum fuel producers or importers, and natural gas distributors operating in Washington state.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P95_S1	The certain stationary sources covered include power plants, petroleum refineries, metal manufacturers, waste facilities and certain organizations responsible for 100,000 metric tons CO 2 emissions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P96_S0	Natural gas distribution emissions are covered from the combustion of natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P96_S1	Natural gas distributors are not responsible for CO 2 emissions from natural gas supplied to another covered party (i.e., a party that emits greater than prescribed thresholds, see below).
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S0	As proposed, when the rule goes into effect in 2017 the Ecology will set a baseline for each source based on at least a three-consecutive-year average between 2012 and 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S1	The Ecology will then set a compliance pathway for each source that requires a 1 2/3% (one and two-thirds percent) reduction in CO 2 emissions per year (5% every three years) from the baseline.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S2	Covered parties under this rule must (1) reduce their covered GHG emissions to meet the reduction pathway or (2) obtain emission reductions from (a) other covered parties, (b) GHG emission reduction projects or (c) external emission market programs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S3	The starting compliance threshold for covered parties is 100,000 metric tons/year (MT/yr) CO 2 emissions, and this will decrease by 5,000 tons every year from 2017 to 2035.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S4	By 2035, sources emitting 70,000 tons and over must comply with the rule.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P97_S5	PSE will continue to monitor and participate in the rulemaking process associated with this measure.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P98_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P98_S1	Compliance, based on a rolling 12-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P99_S0	The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P99_S1	Generating units were given 3 years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P99_S2	Colstrip meets, or is expected to meet the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases by April 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P100_S0	Additional Colstrip Emission Controls On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P100_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P101_S0	The final Federal Implementation Plan for Montana (FIP) for Regional Haze was issued in September 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P101_S1	There are no immediate requirements for Units 3 4, but Units 1 2 will need to upgrade pollution controls to meet new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P102_S0	The Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) on November 15, 2012 and PPL Montana also filed an appeal as the Colstrip operator.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P102_S1	The case was heard on May 15, 2014 in Seattle, Washington, and the final decision by the Ninth Circuit was issued June 9, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P102_S2	The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the EPA s first phase requirements for Colstrip and found that the EPA had not adequately justified the need for two of the control technologies and remanded these two issues back to the EPA.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P102_S3	The ruling in no way affects the future planning periods for the Regional Haze program or the glide path.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P102_S4	The current EPA assessment is that the state of Montana will require significant emission reductions to meet the natural visibility goal by 2064 which means that additional emission reductions will be necessary in future 10-year planning periods, beginning in the 2018-2028 period, and there is risk and uncertainty regarding potential costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P103_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates CCRs under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P103_S1	The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P103_S2	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P104_S0	In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P104_S1	The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P104_S2	The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015 but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P104_S3	The EPA recently updated its schedule once again and the proposal is now slated for publication in June 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P104_S4	At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this ANPRM will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P105_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of February 26, 2016 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P106_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P107_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of February 26, 2016 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_16_ITEM1_P108_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	PSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	PSE's regulatory risks include, but not limited to, the following:
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P3_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	In addition, proceedings with the Washington Commission typically involve multiple stakeholder parties, including consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or decreasing rates.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Power costs on the other hand, are normalized for market, weather and hydrological condition during the applicable rate year, the ensuing 12-month period before rates become effective.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its natural gas customers based on historic costs during a particular test year.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE is currently subject to a Washington Commission order that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Washington Commission previously approved an electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs, along with an ERF, a rate plan and an earnings sharing mechanism that requires PSE and its customers to share in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.77% during the term of the rate plan.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the threshold, even if the other service did not meet the earnings test.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	PSE has been in a stay out period, during which time it could not file for general rate increases (unless for emergency rate relief).
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	PSE must file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016, at which time the decoupling mechanism will be subject to continuation pending the result of the 2016 GRC, which PSE plans to file in March 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including:
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	If PSE is unable to protect its physical assets from terrorist attacks or its information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S1	Despite PSE's implementation of security measures, its physical assets and technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S2	If our technology systems were to fail or be breached and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, these physical asset or cyber-based attacks could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P19_S4	As a result, PSE endeavors to maintain vigilant security programs and procedures to protect against the continuous threat of physical asset and cyber-based attacks, and as a result, PSE may be required to expend significant dollars and other resources to protect against existing and ensuing threats.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P20_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	To fulfill these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including an emission performance standard provision and the EPA set CO 2 emission standards with specific state goals.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Recent decisions related to climate change by the United States Supreme Court and the EPA, together with efforts by Congress, have drawn greater attention to this issue at the federal, state and local level.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P25_S1	PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and gas infrastructure system.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers and also require significant expenditures by PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P27_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to an aging workforce, loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S3	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P29_S2	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Potential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	When a town or city in our service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires our assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that we provide.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Although PSE is compensated in connection with the town or city's acquisition of its assets, any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Technological developments may have an adverse impact on PSE's financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of April 15, 2018.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	No amount was outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Puget Energy's credit facility includes an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	PSE also has two credit facilities, which provide PSE with access to $1.0 billion in short-term borrowing capability, and include an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The two PSE credit facilities mature on April 15, 2019.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P37_S4	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.8 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2015 had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one .
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeals issues related to these taxes.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2016 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Potential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	While management believes the Company has reasonable and prudent insurance coverage and accrues loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	As a holding company, Puget Energy depends on PSE s ability to pay dividends.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0% or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S7	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its' corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S8	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2015 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.9 to 1.0 for the 12 months then ended.
1085392_16_ITEM1A_P49_S9	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Natural Gas Supply.
1085392_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings relating to its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of pending proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_16_ITEM3_P1_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S0	On March 6, 2013, the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S1	Based on a second amended complaint filed in August 2014, plaintiffs' lawsuit currently alleges violations of permitting requirements under the New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act and the Montana State Implementation Plan arising from seven projects undertaken at Colstrip during the time period from 2001 to 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S2	Plaintiffs have since indicated that they do not intend to pursue claims with respect to three of the seven projects, leaving a total of four projects remaining subject to the lawsuit.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S3	The lawsuit claims that, for each of the four projects, the Colstrip plant should have obtained a permit and installed pollution control equipment at Colstrip.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S4	The Plaintiffs' complaint also seeks civil penalties and other appropriate relief.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S5	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S6	The liability trial is currently set for May 2016, and a date for the remedy trial has yet to be determined.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P2_S7	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the complaint, and as such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the outcome of this matter.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P3_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates CCRs under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P3_S1	The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P3_S2	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P3_S3	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P4_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P4_S1	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environment Obligations (ARO).
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S0	In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S1	The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S2	PSE filed comments on this rule in December 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S3	The EPA issued a pre-publication version of the final Clean Power Plan rule under Section 111(d) on August 3, 2015 and published a final rule on October 23, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S4	PSE is reviewing the final rule and working with key stakeholders in preparation towards implementation.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P5_S5	PSE cannot yet provide a determination of how the final rule may impact PSE or its existing generation facilities, if at all.
1085392_16_ITEM3_P6_S0	For more information on litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings, see Item 1, Business, Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation, and Note 14 under Item 8.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings, and are not publicly traded.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P0_S3	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P0_S4	For further discussion, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, Risks Relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	From time to time, when deemed advisable and permitted, each of PSE and Puget Energy pay dividends on its common stock.
1085392_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , PSE paid dividends to its parent, Puget Energy, and Puget Energy paid dividends to its parent, Puget Equico, in the amounts shown in Puget Energy's and PSE's Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity, included in this report.
1085392_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables show selected financial data.
1085392_16_ITEM6_P0_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes, included in Items 7 and 8 of this report, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S0	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S1	The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as Puget Energy's and PSE's objectives, expectations and intentions.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S2	Words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, continues, could, estimates, expects, future, intends, may, might, plans, potential, predicts, projects, should, will likely result, will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward-looking statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S3	However, these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S4	In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S5	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S6	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S7	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S8	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P0_S9	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P1_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P1_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P1_S2	Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P1_S3	All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P2_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P2_S1	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S1	PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S2	The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S3	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year, PSE s net income was affected by the following four factors: (1) changes in unrealized gain and loss in derivative instruments for energy contracts; (2) increased electric margins driven by increased electric revenues; (3) decreased utility operations and maintenance expense due to reduced bad debt expense and meter reading expense; and (4) a reduction in interest expense related to regulatory liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P3_S5	Further detail on each of these primary drivers, as well as other factors affecting performance, is set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P4_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P5_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P5_S1	The Company believes that return on AMA equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P6_S0	The return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P7_S0	ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P7_S1	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P7_S2	The following table presents PSE s GAAP ROE, its return on AMA equity, and its authorized regulated ROE for 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	The Company s 2015 return on AMA equity was 8.3% , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	Regulated equity (rate base times equity percent) was $256.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	The variance was primarily driven by the unanticipated impacts on rate base of bonus depreciation and lower than anticipated capital spending due to slower than anticipated growth in PSE s service territory.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The impact on ROE for this variance was $40.5 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	Utility margins were $6.1 million lower than allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the impacts of warmer than normal weather conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	Depreciation expense was $5.2 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The Company s 2014 return on AMA equity was 8.2%, which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	Utility operations and maintenance expense was $22.1 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	The increase was driven by higher costs in electric production, general and administration, bad debt and customer service expenses.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	Depreciation expense was $5.3 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	The increase was primarily due to additional electric capital expenditures placed into service.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2015 and will continue to do so in future years.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	Further, PSE s financial performance is heavily influenced by general economic conditions in its service territory, which affect customer growth and use-per-customer and thus utility sales.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	Accordingly, the Company will need to seek rate relief on a regular and frequent basis in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	If the Washington Commission determines that a capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	During 2013, PSE completed an ERF, which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S2	The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the annual cash payments for the year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S3	The decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S4	Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S5	The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE s allowed electric and natural gas revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S6	This plan, with limited exceptions (i.e., power cost only rate cases (PCORC) or emergency rate relief), requires PSE to file a GRC no sooner than April 1, 2015 and no later than April 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S7	Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue conservation initiatives that promote efficient use of energy.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S8	PSE s mandate to pursue conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P19_S9	This mandate, however, will only have a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P20_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the ERF which includes the property tax tracker.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_16_ITEM7_P21_S1	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P21_S2	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and it approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P21_S3	In addition, the rate plan increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs which will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next GRC which will be filed before April 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P21_S4	In the rate plan, rate increases are subject to a cap of 3% of total revenue for customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	Order No. 8 in the TransAlta Centralia proceeding granted in part and denied in part PSE's Petition for Reconsideration, clarifying certain portions of the Washington Commission's original order regarding TransAlta Centralia.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms, are expected to mitigate the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S1	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to eliminate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where PCA is not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S2	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S3	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S4	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S5	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers during the following May to April time period.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P23_S6	The decoupling mechanism will end on February 28, 2017 unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in PSE s next GRC filing which PSE is required to file by April 1, 2016 at the latest.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	On April 22, 2015, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	As part of this filing, PSE also requested to change the methodology of how decoupling deferrals are calculated going forward and adjust deferrals calculated in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	The change was done to ensure that the amortization of prior years accumulated decoupling deferrals were not included in the calculation of the current year decoupling deferrals.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S3	The effect of the methodology change in the first quarter of 2015, was a reduction of approximately $12.0 million previously recognized revenue from May through December 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S4	The overall changes represent a rate increase for electric customers of $53.8 million, or 2.6%, annually, and a rate increase for natural gas customers of $22.0 million, or 2.1%, annually, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S5	In addition, PSE exceeded the earnings test threshold for its natural gas business in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S6	As a result, PSE recorded a reduction in natural gas decoupling deferral and revenue of $1.3 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P24_S7	The customers' share of the over earnings will be returned to customers over the subsequent 12-month period beginning May 1 of each year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The 3.0% annual decoupling related cap was triggered for certain rate classes.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The resulting amount of deferral that was not included in the 2015 rate increase is $1.9 million for electric revenue and $8.2 million for natural gas revenue that was accrued through December 31, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	These amounts may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2016, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the 3.0% cap on decoupling related rate increases.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Due to the 3.0% cap on annual decoupling increases noted above and the growing size of decoupling deferrals, PSE performed an analysis as of December 31, 2015 to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P26_S1	The analysis indicated $10.0 million of natural gas decoupling revenue will not be collected within 24 months, therefore PSE did not recognize this portion of decoupling revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P26_S2	However, once it is determined to be collectible within 24 months it will be recognized.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	On August 11, 2015, PSE filed with the Washington Commission, a petition for approval of a special contract for the LNG fuel service with Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc. (TOTE) which upon the Washington Commission approval, has a delivery term that commences January 1, 2019.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	Additionally, the filing contained a request for a declaratory order approving the methodology for allocating costs between regulated and non-regulated LNG services.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P27_S2	A prehearing conference was held on October 13, 2015, which provided for simultaneous briefs on November 20, 2015 and hearings on January 29, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P27_S3	The January hearing date was subsequently stayed.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Commission issued an order on December 18, 2015, provisionally determining jurisdictional questions and setting further process including briefing and oral argument.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	The Commission provisionally determined that it can regulate the sale of LNG to marine shippers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	However, the Commission ruled that it cannot exercise its jurisdiction over the sale of LNG by PSE to TOTE as set forth in PSE s petition because PSE is not offering to provide LNG as a marine fuel to all marine shippers and therefore it is not offering a public service which the Commission regulates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	PSE is reviewing its options related to the LNG service.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	Electric Rates Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	The graduated scale currently applicable is as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	The settlement agreement will not take effect until January 1, 2017.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	Key components of the settlement will result in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues as part of the next GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P34_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA/PCORC.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P35_S0	PSE had an unfavorable PCA imbalance during the year ended December 31, 2015 , due to under recovering $8.7 million of power costs that exceeded the power cost baseline level of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P35_S1	This compares to an unfavorable imbalance of $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 of which $10.1 million was apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P36_S0	On March 26, 2015, PSE filed a request with the Washington Commission to change rates under its electric property tax tracker mechanism, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	PSE filed a substitute filing with the Washington Commission on April 15, 2015 for the electric property tax tracker mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	The proposed rate change incorporates the effects of an increase to property taxes paid as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	This represents a rate increase for electric customers of $8.4 million, or 0.4% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P37_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff On December 30, 2015, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker tariff, effective January 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P37_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $57.3 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P37_S2	Of the total credit, $39.6 million represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $17.7 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2015 rate period.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P37_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate decrease of 0.2%.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P38_S0	The PGA mechanism assures timely recovery of gas costs incurred while balancing the Company's needs to maintain price stability to insulate customers from normal fluctuations in the market price of gas.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P38_S1	On October 29, 2015, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing with an effective date of November 1, 2015, which reflected changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P39_S0	The impact to the PGA rates is an annual revenue decrease of $185.9 million, or 17.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P40_S0	Cost Recovery Mechanism On October 29, 2015, the Washington Commission approved PSE's CRM natural gas tariff filing with an effective date of November 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P40_S1	The purpose of this filing is to recover capital costs related to enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P41_S0	The impact to the CRM rates is an annual revenue increase of $5.3 million, or 0.5% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P42_S0	On March 26, 2015, PSE filed a request with the Washington Commission to change rates under its natural gas property tax tracker mechanism, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P42_S1	PSE made a subsequent substitute natural gas filing with the Washington Commission on May 1, 2015, which changed the rate effective date to June 1, 2015, and represented a rate decrease for natural gas customers of $2.3 million or 0.2% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	For additional information, see Business - Regulation and Rates included in Item 1 of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	Weather Conditions Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	PSE's operating revenue and associated energy supply expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P45_S1	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as a result of weather conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P45_S2	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P45_S3	Varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE also make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	PSE reported lower usage by its residential electric customers in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to Pacific Northwest temperatures being warmer on average as compared to the same period in the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	The actual average temperature during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was 55.89 degrees, or 0.55 degrees warmer than the same period in the prior year, and 3.25 degrees warmer when compared to the historical average.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Customer Demand PSE expects the number of natural gas customers to grow at rates slightly above that of electric customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	PSE also expects energy usage by both residential electric and natural gas customers to continue a long-term trend of slow decline primarily due to continued energy efficiency improvements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Access to Debt Capital PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	PSE's credit facilities expire in 2019 and Puget Energy's senior secured credit facility expires in 2018.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	(See discussion on credit facilities in the section entitled, Financing Program - Credit Facilities ).
1085392_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	These regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier and therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers in its service territory.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P53_S2	Set forth below are the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	The presentation of electric margin and gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P56_S1	Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P56_S2	PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P56_S3	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Electric Margin Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2015 to 2014 and periods 2014 to 2013 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	______________ Includes amortization of prior year collection/refund, reduction related to excess rate of return, and a reduction related to amounts that will not be collected within 24 months.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	2015 compared to 2014 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $44.7 million primarily due to higher residential sales of $57.9 million , higher commercial sales of $43.0 million, partially offset by decreased deferred decoupling revenue and other decoupling revenue of $12.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively and other electric operating revenue of $34.5 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P60_S1	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	Electric retail sales increased $107.9 million due to increases in rates of $113.5 million due primarily to additional $49.1 million credit provided to customers on Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) gain in 2014, $17.0 million of additional Residential Exchange credits, and $12.9 million additional Renewable Energy Credit (REC) credits in 2014, which was partially offset by $5.6 million due to lower retail electricity usage.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	Decoupling revenue resulted in a decrease of $12.1 million due to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer as compared to volumetric revenues in 2015 compared to 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	Other decoupling revenue decreased $22.2 million due to $12.8 million recovery from customers and $9.4 million related to over earnings sharing band of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	Other electric operating revenue decreased $34.5 million primarily due to a reduction of non-core gas sales of $23.8 million and biogas revenues of $10.1 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	Purchased electricity expense decreased $14.6 million primarily due to a $27.4 million decrease in long-term firm and market power purchases, partially offset by $10.1 million related to the PCA customer portion in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $13.6 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices for our combustion turbine generation plants.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $16.6 million resulting from lower Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	The program is administered by the BPA.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	2014 compared to 2013 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues decreased $73.1 million primarily due to lower residential sales of $112.5 million, lower commercial sales of $22.9 million and lower sales to other utilities and marketers of $12.8 million , partially offset by increased decoupling revenue and other operating revenue of $46.3 million and $28.1 million, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P70_S1	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	Electric retail sales decreased $135.6 million primarily due to the JPUD gain of $54.3 million, which was refunded to customers in December 2014, PCORC rate decreases of $10.5 million and lower retail electricity usage of $63.1 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	Sales to other utilities and marketers decreased $12.8 million primarily due to lower wholesale electricity prices which decreased revenue by $3.2 million and a decrease in sales volume of $9.6 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	Decoupling revenue resulted in an additional $31.3 million due to lower volumetric revenues compared to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	This is compared to a decrease of $15.0 million in decoupling revenue in the same period in 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	Other electric operating revenue increased $28.1 million primarily due to an increase in non-core gas sales of $13.5 million and biogas revenues of $10.5 million.

1085392_16_ITEM7_P126_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures are typically funded from a combination of cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P126_S1	PSE s utility construction program expenditures periodically can and do exceed cash flow generated from operations.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P126_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s utility construction program is dependent, in part, on continued access to capital markets.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P127_S0	Puget Sound Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $43.9 million compared to the same period in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P127_S1	The decrease in cash flow was primarily the result of a $66.5 million increase in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue in 2015 compared to a decrease of $153.6 million in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P127_S2	This was partially offset by a $60.7 million increase in cash flow related to the PGA rate increase, a $74.5 million reduction in regulatory asset and liability cash outflows and a $36.6 million increase in deferred income taxes and tax credits.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P128_S0	Puget Energy Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $53.1 million compared to the same period in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P128_S1	The net decrease was primarily impacted by the $43.9 million decrease from cash flow provided by the operating activities of PSE, as previously discussed.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P128_S2	The above decrease was also negatively impacted by Puget Energy's $8.3 million cash outflow related to financing derivatives.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P129_S0	Financing Program The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P129_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P129_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P129_S3	The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months.

1085392_16_ITEM7_P134_S0	In 2006, PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a Demand Promissory Note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P134_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P134_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25%.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P134_S3	On June 30, 2015, PSE repaid in full the $28.9 million outstanding balance under the Note.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P135_S0	The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P135_S1	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P135_S2	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2015 , PSE could issue:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P136_S0	Approximately $434.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $723.3 million of gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P136_S1	At December 31, 2015 , PSE had approximately $6.9 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P137_S0	Shelf Registrations and Long-Term Debt Activity.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P137_S1	PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement under which it may issue, from time to time, up to $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P137_S2	The Company remains subject to the restrictions of PSE s indentures and credit agreements on the amount of first mortgage bonds that PSE may issue.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P138_S0	On May 26, 2015, PSE issued $425.0 million of senior secured notes.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P138_S1	The notes mature in May 2045 and have an interest rate of 4.30%, which is payable semi-annually in May and November.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P138_S2	Net proceeds of the issuance were used to fund the early retirement, including accrued interest and make-whole call premiums, of the Company s $150.0 million 5.197% senior notes maturing in October 2015 and the Company s $250.0 million 6.75% senior notes maturing in January 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P139_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P139_S1	At December 31, 2015 , approximately $464.1 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P140_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P140_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of EBITDA to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P140_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2015 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.9 to one for the 12 months then ended December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P140_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P141_S0	At December 31, 2015, Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility, which expires April 2018.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P141_S1	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P141_S2	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P141_S3	Interest rates may be based on the bank's prime rate or LIBOR, plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P142_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P142_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , there was no amount drawn and outstanding under the facility.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P142_S2	As of the date of this report, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.275% as of the date of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P143_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility or similar variable rate debt (see Part II Item 7A "Interest Rate Risk" section).
1085392_16_ITEM7_P144_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P144_S1	The agreement also contains a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P144_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P145_S0	In June 2014, Puget Energy entered into three bilateral term loans, with two and three year maturities, which in total, equaled $299.0 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P145_S1	The proceeds of the term loans were used to pay off the outstanding Puget Energy revolving credit facility balance, which subsequently allowed the Company to carry the debt with lower interest expense.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P145_S2	All other terms, conditions and covenants are consistent with each other and the credit facility agreements, with the exception of maturity and price.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P146_S0	On May 12, 2015, Puget Energy issued $400.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P146_S1	The notes will mature in May 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.65%, which is payable semi-annually in May and November.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P146_S2	Net proceeds of the issuance were used to repay all amounts outstanding under Puget Energy's three term loans, and to fund a special dividend to shareholders of approximately $96.7 million.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P147_S0	On November 6, 2015, Puget Energy exchanged $400.0 million of its 3.65% senior secured notes that were originally issued in the May 2015 private placement for registered notes of the same amount.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P148_S0	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P148_S1	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P148_S2	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.4 to one for the 12 months then ended December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P148_S3	At December 31, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P149_S0	And Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P149_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P150_S0	Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P151_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P151_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P151_S2	The "current" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P152_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P152_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P152_S2	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P152_S3	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P153_S0	As defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P153_S1	PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P153_S2	Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted, the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the WUTC that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P153_S3	PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P153_S4	However, if the excess amount cannot be collected within 24 months, for GAAP purposes only, the Company will not record any decoupling revenue unless it is within the 24 months of collection, but will collect non-recorded amounts when actually billed.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P154_S0	As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P155_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P156_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P156_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 in the amount of $971.5 million and $663.7 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2014 of $987.4 million and $635.4 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P156_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P157_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P157_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P157_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P158_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P158_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P159_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P159_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Electric Regulation and Rates within Item 1.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P160_S0	Business Regulation and Rates of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P161_S0	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P161_S1	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P162_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P162_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P163_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P163_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P164_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P165_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P166_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P167_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P167_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P167_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P167_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P168_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P168_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (1) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (2) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (3) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (4) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (5) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S2	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $4.6 billion at the October 1, 2015 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S3	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.5 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 30.9% or $1.1 billion.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S4	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $4.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S5	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 2.7% and 6.5%, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P169_S6	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method:
1085392_16_ITEM7_P170_S0	ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P170_S1	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P170_S2	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P170_S3	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P170_S4	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P171_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P171_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P172_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P173_S0	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P173_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P173_S2	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P173_S3	The amount previously recorded in accumulated OCI is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P174_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P174_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P174_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P175_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P176_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P176_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P176_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P176_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P177_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P177_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding originally related to its long-term debt.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P177_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A, Note 9 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P178_S0	ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_16_ITEM7_P178_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P178_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P178_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P179_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P179_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P180_S0	PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P180_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $22.9 million , $13.8 million and $22.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P180_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 58.5%, 61.5% and 60.8% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P180_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $16.7 million and $12.8 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P180_S4	In 2016 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $13.8 million and incremental qualified pension income of $15.2 million, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P181_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_16_ITEM7_P181_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $5.6 million , $4.9 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P181_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.5 million and $0.6 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P181_S3	In 2016 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $4.8 million and incremental pension income of $0.4 million, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S0	PSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S1	PSE recognized income of $0.2 million and $0.4 million and expense of $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.3 million each year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S3	In 2016 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize an immaterial income amount and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S4	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P182_S5	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P183_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P183_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S0	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S1	During 2015 , the Company made a cash contribution of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S2	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S3	At December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company s qualified pension plan was $44.2 million and $64.0 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 93.1% and 90.7% funded, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S4	As of January 1, 2016 , the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P184_S5	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the retirement plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $2.5 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM7_P185_S0	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations increased from 4.25% in 2014 to 4.65% in 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P185_S1	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 5.10% in 2013 to 4.25% in 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P185_S2	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2015 remained unchanged at the 2014 level, or 7.75% .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P185_S3	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits in 2015 also remained unchanged at the 2014 level, or 7.0% .
1085392_16_ITEM7_P186_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_16_ITEM7_P187_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options to manage its electric and gas portfolio risks.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P1_S5	The forward physical electric contracts are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	At December 31, 2015 , the Company had total assets of 29.6 million and total liabilities of 179.2 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P5_S2	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P5_S3	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $11.9 million .
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2015 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Notes 9 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P11_S2	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P11_S3	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P11_S4	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P12_S3	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE held approximately $737.3 million in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had nine counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P14_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P14_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 86% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, were entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P15_S1	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P15_S2	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P16_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P16_S1	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P16_S2	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P16_S3	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P18_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P18_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals by counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P18_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P19_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P19_S2	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P19_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P20_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P20_S1	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties, nor were any of PSE s counterparties required to post additional collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P21_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P21_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P21_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P21_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P21_S4	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's debt instruments:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P22_S0	For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Notes 6 and 10 under Item 8.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P23_S0	From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P23_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2015 was a net loss of $5.7 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P23_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $6.0 million in OCI as of December 31, 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S2	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S4	At December 31, 2015 , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $5.1 million pre-tax loss.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S5	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S6	Currently, all changes in market value are recorded in earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S7	A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the fair value of Puget Energy's interest rate swaps by $0.4 million .
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P24_S8	The following table presents the fair value of Puget Energy s interest rate swaps:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P25_S0	The change in fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2015 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P26_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps at December 31, 2015 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_16_ITEM7A_P27_S0	______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which may utilize broker quotes and internal pricing models.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	Basis of Presentation Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P33_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings), owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiary, PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $234.2 million , $231.7 million and $243.9 million for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Utility Plant Puget Energy and PSE capitalize, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P39_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P39_S2	Replacements of minor items of property are included in maintenance expense.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P39_S3	When the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	Planned Major Maintenance Planned major maintenance is an activity that typically occurs when PSE overhauls or substantially upgrades various systems and equipment on its natural gas fired combustion turbines on a scheduled basis.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	Costs related to planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major maintenance.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P40_S2	This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	Non-Utility Property, Plant and Equipment For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	Replacement of minor items are expensed on a current basis.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired, which were previously recorded in utility plant, are apportioned between regulatory assets/liabilities and earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P42_S1	However, gains and losses on assets sold or retired, not previously recorded in utility plant, are reflected in earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Depreciation and Amortization For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P43_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P43_S2	The depreciation of vehicles and equipment is allocated to the asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P43_S3	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.8% , for each of 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ; depreciable natural gas utility plant was 3.4% , for each of 2015 , 2014 and 2013 ; and depreciable common utility plant was 8.5% , 8.5% and 11.4% in 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P43_S4	The decrease in depreciable common utility plant that occurred between 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to asset retirement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P45_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P50_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P50_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P50_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2015 using an October 1, 2015 measurement date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P52_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P52_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P52_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	Changes in these estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P53_S4	There were no known events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2015 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P54_S1	The cash and cash equivalents balance at Puget Energy was $42.5 million and $37.5 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P54_S2	The 2015 and 2014 balance consisted of cash equivalents, which are reported at cost and approximate fair value, and were $2.4 million and $1.8 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	Fuel and Natural Gas Inventory Fuel and natural gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P56_S2	Natural gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P56_S3	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980 Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P57_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P57_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P57_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term due to the length of the amortization.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	For further details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 3.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending primarily upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to interest expense and as a non-cash item to other income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	The AFUDC rates authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility plant additions are based on the effective dates as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P62_S1	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P62_S2	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	The non-utility subsidiary recognizes revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	Sales of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are deferred as a regulatory liability.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S2	Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery under alternative revenue recognition standard.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S3	To record revenues under this program, the Company must be able to collect the revenue within 24 months based on alternative revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S4	Decoupled rate increases are effective May 1 of each year subject to a 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S5	Any excess revenue above 3.0% will be included in the following year's decoupled rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S6	The Company will be able to recognize revenue below the 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P67_S7	For revenue deferrals exceeding the annual 3.0% rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, the Company will assess the excess amount to determine its ability to be collected within 24 months.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	record any decoupling revenue unless it is within the 24 months of collection, but will collect non-recorded amounts when actually billed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	Revenues associated with energy costs under the Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism and Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P69_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P69_S3	The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $9.8 million and $7.5 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	Self-Insurance PSE is self-insured for storm damage and environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	In addition, PSE is required to meet a deductible for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy's and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings, who is the ultimate tax payer.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P73_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE purchases natural gas for its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the natural gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in other electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	PSE records the benefit of the PTCs as a regulatory liability until such time as PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	Once utilized, PSE will pass the benefit to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P78_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for energy related derivatives due to the PCA mechanism and PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P78_S2	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting in 2009.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P78_S3	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P78_S4	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P79_S1	When these contracts are settled, the contract price becomes part of purchased electricity or electric generation fuel which becomes part of PSE s PCA mechanism and the unrealized gain or loss is listed separately under energy costs, as it represents the non-rate treatment of energy costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding originally related to its long-term debt.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P80_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	As permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P81_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ", which outlines a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P84_S2	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	In addition to the FASB's deferral decision, FASB provided reporting entities with an option to adopt ASU 2014-09 for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, the original effective date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 according to the original effective date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S3	Reporting entities also have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Company initiated a steering committee and project team to evaluate the impact of this standard, update any policies and procedures that may be affected and implement the new revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P85_S5	At this time, the Company cannot determine the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	This new guidance affects only the presentation of debt issuance costs and not the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	ASU 2015-03 is to be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	In accordance with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) meeting about debt issuance costs, ASU 2015-15 amended the accounting guidance updated by ASU 2015-03 to allow reporting entities the option to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P87_S2	Early adoption of the amendments is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P87_S3	The Company plans to adopt the amendments during fiscal year 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	The amount of unamortized debt issuance costs at Puget Energy as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $38.4 million and $35.7 million , respectively.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	ASU 2015-05 requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement to follow internal-use software guidance if both of the following criteria are met: the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the cloud computing arrangement and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	If the customer does not meet both criteria, the cloud computing arrangement is considered a service contract and separate accounting for a license would not be permitted.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-05 during fiscal year 2016 and is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts, if any, of this new guidance on its financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, " Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) ," which removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which their fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	This ASU also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	Instead, those disclosures will be limited to investments for which the Company has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P91_S3	ASU 2015-07 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and requires reporting entities to apply this ASU retrospectively to all periods presented.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P93_S0	Retirement Benefits In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-12, " Plan Accounting:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), and Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	ASU 2015-12 is made up of three parts: Part I, Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts (Part I); Part II, Plan Investment Disclosures (Part II); and Part III, Measurement Date Practical Expedient (Part III).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P95_S0	Part I requires fully benefit-responsive contracts to be measured, presented and disclosed only at contract value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P95_S1	Part II requires both participant-directed and nonparticipant-directed investments of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, and removes the requirement to include the disclosure of (i) the investment strategy of an investment measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and is part of a fund that files a U.S. Department of Labor Form 5500; and (ii) the net appreciation or depreciation for investments by general type.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P96_S0	Part III provides entities that have a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end a practical expedient to permit plans to measure investments and investment-related accounts as of a month-end date that is closest to the plan's fiscal year-end.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P96_S1	All three parts are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted for each part.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	Parts I and II must be applied retrospectively for all financial statements presented.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The amendments in Part III must be applied prospectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-12 during the fiscal year 2016, and is in the process of evaluating the potential impacts, if any, of this new guidance on its financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	ASU 2015-13 allows certain reporting entities that enter into derivative contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity on a forward basis and arrange for transmission through a nodal energy market, to designate those contracts as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, if the physical delivery criterion is met.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	This designation removes the ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requirement to measure those derivative contracts at fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	This amendment was effective upon issuance, and if elected, the guidance must be applied prospectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	ASU 2015-17 requires reporting entities to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P99_S1	This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Regulatory accounting allows PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P101_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P101_S2	Below is a table with the allowed return on the net regulatory assets and liabilities and the associated time periods:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 included the following:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Commission rate proceeding.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P104_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P105_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write-off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P105_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P106_S0	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO), PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $347.5 million and $313.1 million in 2015 and 2014 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P106_S1	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S0	2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the expedited rate filing (ERF) which is limited in scope and rate impact, includes the property tax tracker, and is intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism are to operate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S2	The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S3	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S4	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S5	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S6	In addition, the rate plan increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next GRC which will be filed before April 1, 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P107_S7	In the rate plan, increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P108_S0	Order No. 8 in the TransAlta Centralia proceeding granted in part and denied in part PSE's Petition for Reconsideration, clarifying certain portions of the Washington Commission's original order regarding TransAlta Centralia.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S0	On July 24, 2013, the Public Counsel Division of the Washington State Attorney General's Office (Public Counsel) and the Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities (ICNU) each filed a petition in Thurston County Superior Court (the Court) seeking judicial reviews of various aspects of the Washington Commission's ERF and decoupling mechanism final order.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S1	The parties' petition argued that the order violates various procedural and substantive requirements of the Washington Administrative Procedure Act, and so requests that it be vacated and that the matter be remanded to the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S2	Oral arguments regarding this matter were held on May 9, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S3	On June 25, 2014, the court issued a letter decision in which it affirmed the attrition adjustment (escalating factors referred to as the K-Factor) and the Washington Commission's decision not to consider the case as a GRC, but reversed and remanded the cost of equity for further adjudication consistent with the court's decision.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S4	The remand proceeding evidentiary hearings regarding return on equity (ROE) were held in February 2015 and initial briefs and reply briefs were filed in March 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P109_S5	The Washington Commission issued a final order on remand on June 29, 2015, in which it found that 9.8% is a reasonable ROE for PSE for the term of the rate plan, taking decoupling and other relevant factors into account.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S0	Expedited Rate Filing On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission approved PSE's electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism and ERF tariff filings, effective July 1, 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S1	The estimated revenue impact of the decoupling mechanism for electric and natural gas customers is an increase of $21.4 million , or 1.0% , annually and an increase of $10.8 million , or 1.1% annually, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S2	The estimated revenue impact of the ERF filings for electric and natural gas customers is an increase of $30.7 million , or 1.5% , annually and a decrease of $2.0 million , or a decrease of 0.2% annually, respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S3	In its order, the Washington Commission approved a weighted cost of capital of 7.77% and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a ROE of 9.8% .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S4	Subsequently, certain parties to this proceeding petitioned the Washington Commission to reconsider the order.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S5	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved the settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P110_S6	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P111_S0	On February 4, 2013, PSE filed revised tariffs in an ERF proceeding seeking to update the rates set by the Washington Commission in the final order of May 2012 in PSE's general rate case (GRC).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P111_S1	This ERF filing was limited in scope and rate impact.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P111_S2	This filing was primarily intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms, described below, were proposed to operate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P111_S3	The filing also provided for the collection of property taxes through a property tax tracker mechanism based on cash payments of property tax made by PSE during the year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P111_S4	Any difference between the cash payments and property tax accruals will be deferred and recovered in a property tax tracker.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms, are expected to mitigate the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S1	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to eliminate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer with the exception of the electric business where PCA is not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S2	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S3	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S4	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S5	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers during the following May to April time period.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P112_S6	The decoupling mechanism will end on February 28, 2017 unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in PSE s next GRC filing which PSE is required to file by April 1, 2016 at the latest.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S0	On April 22, 2015, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S1	As part of this filing, PSE also requested to change the methodology of how decoupling deferrals are calculated going forward and adjust deferrals calculated in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S2	The change was done to ensure that the amortization of prior years accumulated decoupling deferrals were not included in the calculation of the current year decoupling deferrals.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S3	The effect of the methodology change was a reduction of approximately $12.0 million previously recognized revenue from May through December of 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S4	The overall changes represent a rate increase for electric customers of $53.8 million , or 2.6% , annually, and a rate increase for natural gas customers of $22.0 million , or 2.1% , annually, effective May 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S5	In addition, PSE exceeded the earnings test threshold for its natural gas business in 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S6	As a result, PSE recorded a reduction in natural gas decoupling deferral and revenue of $1.3 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S7	This was reflected as a reduction to the natural gas rate increases noted above.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S8	As noted earlier, the Company is also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S9	This limitation was triggered for certain rate classes.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S10	The resulting amount of deferral that was not included in the 2015 rate increase is $1.9 million for electric revenue and $8.2 million for natural gas revenue that was accrued through December 31, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P113_S11	These amounts may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2016, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the 3.0% cap on decoupling related rate increases.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P114_S0	On April 24, 2014, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism, effective May 1, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P114_S1	The rate change incorporated the effects of an increase to the allowed delivery revenue per customer as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P114_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric customers of $10.6 million , or 0.5% annually, and a rate decrease for natural gas customers of $1.0 million , or 0.1% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P115_S0	On December 13, 2013, the Washington Commission approved a series of settlement agreements for rates effective January 1, 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P115_S1	These settlement agreements do not materially change the revenues originally approved in June 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P115_S2	As a result, certain high volume natural gas industrial customers rate schedules are excluded from the decoupling mechanism and will be subject to certain effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in customer usage patterns.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Washington Commission issued a GRC order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P116_S1	In 2015 and 2014 , PSE incurred $33.6 million and $29.7 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $22.4 million was deferred in 2015 and $18.0 million was deferred in 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P117_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case A limited-scope proceeding was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P117_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the power cost only rate case (PCORC) proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P117_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P117_S3	The following table sets forth PCORC rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P118_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P118_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs as a component rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P118_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P118_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P118_S4	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P119_S0	The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P119_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S0	Accounting Orders and Petitions PSE completed the sale of its electric infrastructure assets located in Jefferson County and the transition of electrical services in the county to Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) on March 31, 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S1	The proceeds from the sale exceeded the transferred assets' net carrying value of $46.7 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $60.0 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S2	In accordance with a 2010 Washington Commission order, PSE deferred the gain and recorded it as a regulatory liability pending the Washington Commission's determination of the accounting and ratemaking treatment.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S3	On October 31, 2013, PSE filed an accounting petition for a Washington Commission order that would authorize PSE to retain the gain of $45.0 million and return $15.0 million to its remaining customers over a period of 48 months.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S4	On March 28, 2014, intervenors filed response testimonies containing their respective proposals for allocation of the gain, which included a proposal of up to $57.0 million to customers and $3.0 million to PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S5	A final order was rendered on September 11, 2014 which authorized PSE to retain $7.5 million of the gain and return $52.7 million to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S6	The customer portion was booked to a regulatory liability account in other current liabilities and accrued interest at PSE's after-tax rate of return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P120_S7	PSE paid this amount to customers through a bill credit in the month of December 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P121_S0	Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the power cost baseline included in revenue requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P122_S0	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P122_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P122_S2	The graduated scale currently applicable is as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P123_S0	On August 7, 2015 the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P123_S1	The settlement agreement will not take effect until January 1, 2017.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P123_S2	Key components of the settlement will result in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P124_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues as part of the next GRC.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA/PCORC.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	PSE had an unfavorable PCA imbalance during the year ended December 31, 2015 , due to under recovering $8.7 million of power costs that exceeded the power cost baseline level of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P126_S1	This compares to an unfavorable imbalance of $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 of which $10.1 million was apportioned to customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The Federal Incentive tracker tariff passes the benefits associated with treasury grants received by the company and PTCs available through to its customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P127_S3	The following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	The purpose of the Cost Recovery Mechanism (CRM) is to recover depreciation expense and return on the investment in the Company's pipeline replacement program to enhance the safety of the natural gas distribution system until included in base rates for gas service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	The following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs as a component rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P129_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P129_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P129_S4	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P130_S3	The following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P131_S1	The Company has been named by the environmental protection agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	During 1992, the Washington Commission issued orders regarding the treatment of costs incurred by the Company for certain sites under its environmental remediation program.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P133_S1	The orders authorize the Company to accumulate and defer prudently incurred cleanup costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	Per the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly basis.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $32.6 million for gas and $6.1 million for electric.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S1	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S2	The Company is also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and Bellingham, Washington.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S3	The Company has taken the lead for both projects, and as of December 31, 2015 , the Company s share of future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $23.9 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S4	The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are $14.0 million , $13.4 million , and $12.3 million at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P136_S5	The Company's deferred natural gas environmental costs are $52.9 million , $52.6 million , and $45.1 million at December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P137_S1	At December 31, 2015 , approximately $464.1 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3 to one .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P138_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.7% at December 31, 2015 , and the EBITDA to interest expense was 4.9 to one for the twelve months then ended December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P139_S1	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P139_S2	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to one .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P139_S3	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.4 to one for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P139_S4	At December 31, 2015 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost at the Company's ownership share.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P140_S1	The following table indicates the Company s percentage ownership and the extent of the Company s investment in jointly owned generating plants in service at December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P140_S2	These amounts are also included in the Utility Plant table above.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has recorded liabilities for steam generation sites, combustion turbine generation sites, combined cycle generation sites, wind generation sites, distribution and transmission poles, gas mains, and leased facilities where disposal is governed by ASC 410 ARO .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	On April 17, 2015, the U.S. EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash surface impoundments by establishing technical requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P142_S2	The rule also sets out recordkeeping and reporting requirements including requirements to post specific information to a publicly-accessible website.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company s Colstrip, Montana coal-fired steam electric generation facility(Colstrip) operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second and third quarter of 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip, in 2003.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S2	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the ARO.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S3	The actual ARO costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S4	We will continue to gather additional data and coordinate with the plant operator to make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P143_S5	As additional information becomes available, the Company will update the ARO obligation for these changes, which could be material.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	The following table describes the changes to the Company s ARO liability as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, ARO, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2015 due to:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground fuel storage tanks.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	An obligation to pay decommissioning costs at the end of utility service franchise agreements to restore the surface of the franchise area.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if FERC orders the project to be decommissioned, although PSE contends that FERC does not have such authority.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P151_S1	Given the value of ongoing generation, flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and cannot be reasonably estimated.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	____________ Puget Western, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PSE, Promissory Note.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	PSE's senior secured notes will cease to be secured by the pledged first mortgage bonds on the date that all of the first mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under the electric or natural gas utility mortgage indenture have been retired.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P154_S3	Substantially all utility properties owned by PSE are subject to the lien of the Company s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P154_S4	To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE s earnings available for interest must exceed certain minimums as defined in the indentures.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P154_S5	At December 31, 2015 , the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P154_S6	On May 26, 2015, PSE issued $425.0 million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P154_S7	The notes mature in May 2045 and have an interest rate of 4.30% , which is payable semi-annually in May and November.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P155_S4	On or after March 1, 2023, the Company may elect to call the bonds at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof, without premium, plus accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P155_S5	Due to the refinance of the Bonds, Puget Energy wrote off $18.0 million of fair value related to the Bonds that were redeemed to interest expense.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	Each series of the Bonds is collateralized by a pledge of PSE s first mortgage bonds, the terms of which match those of the Bonds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P156_S1	No payment is due with respect to the related series of first mortgage bonds so long as payment is made on the Bonds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	Puget Energy Long-Term Debt In June 2014, Puget Energy entered into three bilateral term loans, with two and three year maturities, which in total, equaled $299.0 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P157_S1	The proceeds of the term loans were used to pay off the outstanding Puget Energy revolving credit facility balance, which subsequently allowed the Company to carry the debt with lower interest expense.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	On May 12, 2015, Puget Energy issued $400.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	The notes mature in May 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.65% , which is payable semi-annually in May and November.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P158_S2	Net proceeds of the issuance were used to repay all amounts outstanding under Puget Energy's three term loans, and to fund a special dividend to shareholders of approximately $96.7 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	On November 6, 2015, Puget Energy exchanged $400.0 million of its 3.65% senior secured notes that were originally issued in the May 2015 private placement for registered notes of the same amount.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2015 and 2014 was 4.24% and 4.05% , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P161_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	Puget Sound Energy Credit Facilities PSE has two unsecured revolving credit facilities which provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P162_S3	The credit facilities also have an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.450 billion .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P162_S4	In April 2014, the Company completed a one-year extension on both of the liquidity and hedging facilities, extending the maturity from February 2018 to April 2019, and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facilities from when they were committed in 2013.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P163_S0	The credit agreements are syndicated among numerous lenders and contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to transact with affiliates, make asset dispositions and investments or permit liens to exist.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P163_S1	The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less.

1085392_16_ITEM8_P163_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenant ratios.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S0	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S1	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S2	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S3	The spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S4	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.25% and the commitment fee is 0.175% .

1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S6	No letters of credit were outstanding under either facility, and $159.0 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P164_S7	Outside of the credit agreements, PSE had a $3.9 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P165_S0	Demand Promissory Note PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a demand promissory note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P165_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P165_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P165_S3	On June 30, 2015, PSE repaid in full the $28.9 million outstanding balance under the Note.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P166_S0	At December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P166_S1	In April, 2014, the Company completed an amendment to the senior secured credit facility, extending the maturity from February 2017 to April 2018, updating the fee structure, eliminating a financial covenant and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P166_S2	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P166_S3	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P166_S4	Interest rates may be based on the bank's prime rate or LIBOR plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P167_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P167_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , there was no amount drawn and outstanding under the facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P167_S2	As a result of Puget Energy's credit rating upgrade in 2014, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.275% as of the date of this report.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P168_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility or similar variable rate debt (see Note 9 for more details).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P169_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P169_S1	The agreement also contains a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P169_S2	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P170_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P170_S1	Certain leases contain purchase options, renewal options and escalation provisions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P170_S2	Operating lease expenses net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P171_S0	Payments received for the subleases of properties were immaterial for each of the years ended 2015 , 2014 and 2013 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P171_S1	Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts are:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P172_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P172_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P172_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and PSE's related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P173_S0	In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P173_S1	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P173_S2	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P173_S3	The forward physical electric agreements are both fixed and variable (at index), while the physical natural gas contracts are variable.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P174_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts with various counterparties.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P174_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P175_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P175_S2	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P175_S3	As of December 31, 2015 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding which extend to January 2017 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P175_S4	Currently, these swap instruments do not hedge any variable interest rate debt.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P176_S0	to monitor the economics of terminating the swaps, and unless the economics of terminating the swaps become more favorable, management intends to let them expire naturally in 2017 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P177_S0	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P177_S1	The following table presents the volumes, fair values and locations of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P178_S0	___________ Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P178_S1	Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P179_S0	Interest rate swap contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P179_S1	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P180_S0	The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P180_S1	Net purchase and sale volumes for electric portfolio derivatives consist of electric generation fuel of 202.1 million One Million British Thermal Units (MMBtus) and purchased electricity of 0.1 million Megawatt Hours (MWhs) at December 31, 2015 and 140.2 million MMBtus and 5.4 million MWhs at December 31, 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P181_S0	For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 10.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P182_S0	It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level, without offsetting assets or liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P182_S1	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P182_S2	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P183_S0	The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P184_S0	The following tables present the potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative assets and liabilities:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P185_S0	___________ All Derivative Contract deals are executed under ISDA, NAESB and WSPP Master Netting Agreements with Right of set-off.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P186_S0	Interest Rate Swap Contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P187_S0	The following tables present the effect and locations of the Company's derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, recorded on the statements of income:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P188_S0	_______________ Differences between Puget Energy and PSE are due to certain derivative contracts recorded at fair value in 2009 and subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P188_S1	These differences occurred through February 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P189_S0	The unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts is reported in the statement of cash flows under the operating activities section.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P189_S1	However, due to purchase accounting requirements, all derivative contracts at Puget Energy were assessed to identify contracts that have a more than an insignificant fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P189_S2	If the fair value was greater than 10% of the notional value, the contract was deemed as having a financing element.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P189_S3	For those contracts, the cash inflows (outflows) are presented in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P189_S4	For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , cash outflows related to financing activities of $8.0 million , $16.3 million and $34.3 million , respectively, were reported on Puget Energy's statement of cash flows.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P190_S0	For derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges (including both commodity and interest rate swap contracts), the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative was recorded as a component of OCI, and then reclassified into earnings in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P190_S1	The Company does not attempt cash flow hedging for any new transactions and records all mark-to-market adjustments through earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	The following tables present the Company's pre-tax gain (loss) on derivatives that were previously in a cash flow hedge relationship, and subsequently reclassified out of accumulated OCI into income:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	_______________ Within the next twelve months, $0.5 million of losses in AOCI will be reclassified into earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P194_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P194_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P194_S2	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial distress.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P194_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P194_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S2	However, as of December 31, 2015 , approximately 99.2% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and 0.8% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S3	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S4	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S5	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S6	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P195_S7	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P196_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P196_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P197_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P197_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P198_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the quarter.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P199_S1	As of December 31, 2015 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P199_S2	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company's derivative activity at December 31, 2015 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	__________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P203_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P203_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P204_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P204_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P206_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P207_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P208_S1	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P209_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P209_S2	Inputs used to estimate the fair value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and discount factors.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P209_S3	Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	For interest rate swaps, the Company obtains monthly mark-to-market values from an independent external pricing service for LIBOR forward rates, which is a significant input.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P211_S2	Some of the inputs of the interest rate swap valuations, which are less significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties, assumptions for time value and the impact of the Company's nonperformance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash as Level 1 financial instruments due to cash being at stated value, and cash equivalents at quoted market prices.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company considers its electric, natural gas and interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P212_S2	Management's assessment was based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices (e.g., Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P213_S1	However, certain energy derivative instruments with maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	The following table presents the carrying value for cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable and short-term debt by level, within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P214_S1	The carrying values below are representative of fair values due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P215_S1	Carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	_______________ Income Statement location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $(7.4) million , $(9.6) million , and $(13.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P217_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P219_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P220_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P220_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P220_S3	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P221_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P221_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P221_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P222_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P222_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2015 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P224_S1	Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	At December 31, 2015 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $1.3 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P227_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P227_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P229_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	During 2015 and 2014, Puget Energy completed valuation and impairment testing of its power purchase contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P230_S1	In 2015 and 2014, due to continued significant decreases in forward power prices, the following impairments were recorded to one of the Company's intangible asset contracts, with corresponding reductions to the regulatory liability as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	The valuations were measured using a discounted cash flow, income-based valuation methodology.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P231_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract pricing which provided future net cash flow estimates which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P231_S2	A less significant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P231_S3	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the impaired long term power purchase contracts' fair value in 2015 and 2014:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Company's Investment Plan is a qualified employee 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P232_S1	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $16.1 million , $14.9 million and $14.6 million for the years 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P233_S1	Non-represented employees and United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (UA) represented employees hired before January 1, 2014, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 (IBEW) represented employees hired before December 12, 2014, have the following company contributions:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55% of an employee s contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 will have access to the 401(k) Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	Non-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014, and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will have access to the 401(k) plan and will choose how they want to accumulate funds for retirement, choosing from one of the two contribution sources from PSE:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	401(k) Company Matching: New non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive company match each paycheck based on a new schedule- 100% match on the first 3% of pay contributed and 50% match on the next 3% of pay contributed.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P237_S1	An employee who contributes 6% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P237_S2	Company matching will be immediately vested.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	Company Contribution: New UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P238_S1	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P238_S2	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P238_S3	The Company s 4% contribution will vest after three years of service.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Pension Benefits) covering the largest portion of PSE employees.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary, years of service and, in the case of employees in the cash balance formula plan, the applicable annual interest crediting rates.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P239_S2	Starting with January 1, 2014, all newly hired non-represented employees, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry employees, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 hired on or after December 12, 2014 who elect to accumulate the Company contribution in the cash balance formula portion of the pension plan, will receive annual pay credits of 4% each year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P239_S3	They will also receive interest credits like other participants in the cash balance pension formula of the pension plan, which are at least 1% per quarter.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	When an employee with a vested cash balance formula benefit leaves PSE, he or she will have annuity and lump sum options for distribution.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	Those who select the lump sum option will receive their current cash balance amount.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides legacy group health care and life insurance benefits (Other Benefits) for certain retired employees.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S2	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S3	The insurance premiums, paid primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S4	Puget Energy records purchase accounting adjustments associated with the re-measurement of the retirement plans.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P241_S5	The following tables summarize the Company s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets and amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :

1085392_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and PSE's net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and PSE's benefit obligations recognized in OCI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	The estimated net (loss) gain and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2016 by PSE are $15.0 million and $1.6 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S1	The estimated net (loss) gain for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2016 is $1.3 million .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S2	The estimated prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2016 is immaterial .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S3	The estimated net (loss) gain and prior service cost (credit) for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2016 is immaterial.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S4	For Puget Energy, the overall amounts expected to be amortized from accumulated OCI into net period benefit cost in 2016 were immaterial.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P245_S5	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the qualified pension plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $2.5 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 7.20% in 2016 grading down to 4.30% in 2017 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P247_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P248_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	PSE market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P251_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P252_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P252_S2	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P252_S3	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid during the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P254_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P255_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P255_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P256_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P256_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	Plan Fair Value Measurements ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P258_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (2) major categories of plan assets; (3) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (4) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (5) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P259_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P260_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_16_ITEM8_P261_S0	_________________ Non US Equity investments are comprised of a mutual fund (at level 1); and a commingled fund (at level 2).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P261_S1	The investment in the mutual fund is valued at the daily closing price as reported by the funds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P261_S2	The investment in the commingled fund is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P262_S0	Domestic large cap equity investments are comprised of common stock (at level 1), and a commingled fund (at level 2).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S0	Investments in common stock traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S1	Securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on that date are valued at the last reported sale or bid price, as available or at values based upon bid quotations for identical or similar instruments.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S2	The investment in the commingled fund is valued at the net asset value per share multiplied by the number of shares held as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S3	Domestic small cap equity investments are comprised of common stock and a mutual fund, please see 1 and 2 above for a description.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S4	Fixed income securities consist of mutual funds and US treasury bonds (at level 1), and government securities and corporate bonds (at level 2).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P263_S5	Please see 1 above for a description of mutual funds.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P264_S0	Government securities and corporate bonds are valued using pricing models maximizing the use of observable inputs for similar securities.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P264_S1	When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar bonds, the bond is valued under a discounted cash flow approach maximizing observable inputs.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P265_S0	As of December 31, 2015 absolute return investments consist of two partnerships.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P265_S1	The partnerships are valued based on the net asset value provided by the Plan's investment custodians, and reported in the funds' financial statements which are audited annually by independent accountants.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P265_S2	These investments are at Level 3 under ASC 820 because the significant valuation inputs are primarily internal to the partnerships with little third party involvement.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P266_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund (at level 1) and a collective trust fund (at level 2).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P266_S1	The money market fund is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P267_S0	The collective trust fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P268_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P269_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P269_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P269_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P270_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund (at level 1) and a collective trust fund (at level 2).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P270_S1	The money market fund is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_16_ITEM8_P271_S0	The collective trust fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P272_S0	The details of income tax (benefit) expense are as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P273_S0	The following reconciliation compares pre-tax book income at the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the actual income tax expense in the Statements of Income:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P274_S0	The Company s net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P275_S0	ASU 2015-17 requires reporting entities to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P275_S1	The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 for year ended December 31, 2015 and the impact to Puget Energy and PSE was a reclass in 2014 from current to noncurrent of $161.4 million and $208.4 million , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P275_S2	Except for changes in Consolidated Balance Sheet presentation, this guidance does not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S3	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S4	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2027 through 2035.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S5	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2033.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P276_S6	No valuation allowance has been provided for PTC or net operating loss carryforwards.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P277_S0	For ratemaking purposes, deferred taxes are not provided for certain temporary differences.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P277_S1	PSE has established a regulatory asset for income taxes recoverable through future rates related to those temporary differences for which no deferred taxes have been provided, based on prior and expected future ratemaking treatment.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P278_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P278_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P279_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P279_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P280_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P280_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P281_S0	For ASC 740 purposes, the Company has open tax years from 2012 through 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P281_S1	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P282_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S0	On March 6, 2013, the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S1	Based on a second amended complaint filed in August 2014, plaintiffs' lawsuit currently alleges violations of permitting requirements under the New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act and the Montana State Implementation Plan arising from seven projects undertaken at Colstrip during the time period from 2001 to 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S2	Plaintiffs have since indicated that they do not intend to pursue claims with respect to three of the seven projects, leaving a total of four projects remaining subject to the lawsuit.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S3	The lawsuit claims that, for each of the four projects, the Colstrip plant should have obtained a permit and installed pollution control equipment at Colstrip.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S4	The Plaintiffs' complaint also seeks civil penalties and other appropriate relief.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S5	The case has been bifurcated into separate liability and remedy trials.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S6	The liability trial is currently set for May 2016, and a date for the remedy trial has yet to be determined.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P283_S7	PSE is litigating the allegations set forth in the complaint, and as such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the outcome of this matter.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P284_S0	Other Proceedings The Company is also involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P284_S1	The Company has recorded reserves of $0.3 million and $1.7 million relating to these claims as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 13.9% of the Company s energy output was obtained at an average cost of approximately $0.022 per Kilowatt Hour (kWh) through long-term contracts with three of the Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project, in proportion to the contractual share of power that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_16_ITEM8_P285_S5	The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31:
1085392_16_ITEM8_P286_S0	As of December 31, 2015 , the Company purchased portions of the power output of the PUDs' projects as set forth in the following table:

1085392_16_ITEM11_P1_S0	Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2015 the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P2_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P3_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P3_S1	Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of short and long-term Company goals.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P4_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of the executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (Cook Co.).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P4_S2	The Committee recommends to the full Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Cook Co., and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P4_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P5_S0	In 2015, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P6_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P6_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with similar companies of similar size and scope of operations so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P7_S1	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P8_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P9_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P10_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P10_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P10_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P11_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P12_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P13_S0	Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P13_S1	The CEO leads the talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P13_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P13_S3	Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P13_S4	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S2	Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S3	The total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group described below and drive the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S4	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S5	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P14_S6	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2015 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P15_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness To help inform the Committee s recommendations for 2015 base salaries, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive programs, the Committee reviewed both market data obtained from industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation benchmarking peer group.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P15_S1	The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Towers Watson 2014 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P15_S2	The 26 companies in the custom market survey cut used to inform compensation decisions for 2015 are:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P16_S0	As noted, the market survey data were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 14 companies, all but one of which overlapped with companies included in the market survey data.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P16_S1	The 2014 median revenue of the executive compensation peers was $3.4 billion, which was comparable to PSE s annual revenues of $3.2 billion at the time the peer group was developed.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P17_S0	As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of industry practice, with deviations by individual executive as described below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P17_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, actual compensation is expected to be below this targeted level and if Company performance significantly exceeds target, actual compensation is expected to be above this targeted level.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P18_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P18_S1	Despite the median philosophy, the Company may choose to target an executive s compensation above or below the 50th percentile of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P18_S2	In addition to the foregoing survey data, the Committee generally also received advice from Cook Co. in connection with 2015 compensation decisions.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P19_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of total compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P20_S0	As mentioned above, base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee based on its median philosophy, internal equity considerations and individual executive considerations such as expertise level of performance achievement, experience in role and contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S0	Base Salary Adjustments for 2015 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2015 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries as shown in the table below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S2	The adjustments were effective March 1, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S3	Base salaries for 2015 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S4	The annual salary for Ms. Harris is unchanged from 2014, given that her current base salary was slightly higher than the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P21_S5	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were in a range of 2% to 4%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P22_S0	2015 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P22_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P23_S0	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P24_S0	For 2015, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against nine Service Quality Indicators (SQIs) covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P24_S1	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P24_S2	Annual incentive funding is decreased if a SQI is not achieved.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P25_S0	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P25_S1	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P25_S2	The SQIs for 2015 were the same as those in 2014 and were as follows:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P26_S0	Customer Satisfaction (3 SQIs) - Customer satisfaction with the telephone access center and natural gas field services and number of Washington Commission complaints.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P26_S1	Customer Service (2 SQIs) - Calls answered live and on-time appointments.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P27_S0	Safety and Reliability (4 SQIs) - Gas emergency response, electric emergency response, non-storm outage frequency and non-storm outage duration.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P28_S0	In 2015, the Company retained a safety performance measure in the annual incentive plan funding to promote its continued commitment to employee safety.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P28_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the nine SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P28_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P29_S0	The safety performance measure contains four targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P29_S1	The four targets for 2015 were:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P30_S0	All employees attend a monthly safety meeting in a box presentation, or complete the same content online.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P30_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95%.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P31_S0	The Company DART ( D ays A way from Work, days of R estricted Work, or Job T ransfer) not to exceed a rate of 0.61 in 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P32_S0	Field employees to attend the Industrial Athlete program, a new training designed to improve mobility and strengthen stability.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P32_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95% of field employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P33_S0	Office employees to complete an on-line training to increase awareness on ergonomic resources and tools available to help reduce sprain and strain injuries.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P33_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95% of office employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P34_S0	In 2015, 100% funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all nine SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P34_S1	In total, eight of the 10 customer service and safety measures were met or deemed met.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P34_S2	The two SQIs not met were SQI 3, System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and SQI 5, Telephone Center Answering Performance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P35_S0	Funding levels for 2015 at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P36_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but did not exclude any items for 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P37_S0	downward based on an evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals that align with the corporate goals described below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P38_S0	2015 Corporate Goals In 2015, the Company continued using the Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) to summarize for employees the direction and overall goals of the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P38_S1	The plan has five objectives which capture our 2015 corporate goals and which have been communicated to our employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P38_S2	Each employee, including the Named Executive Officers, has specific individual and team goals linked to driving strategies that meet one or more of the following objectives:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P39_S0	Safety- Our Safety Objective is our foundation: If Nobody Gets Hurt Today, we will feel safe and secure and be able to perform at our best.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P40_S0	People- When we re Safe, we can achieve our People Objective of being a Great Place to Work, with engaged employees who live our values, embrace an ownership culture and are motivated to drive results for our company and our customers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P41_S0	Process and Tools - Engaged employees take us to our Process and Tools Objective where results start with achieving Operational Excellence, with continuous improvement of our internal processes and tools so that we can increase efficiency, eliminate waste, improve reliability and enhance customer service.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P42_S0	Customer - We now have the fundamentals to achieve our Customer Objective of delivering greater value and being our Customer s Energy Partner of Choice in a competitive marketplace.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P43_S0	Financial- Being our customer s energy partner of choice takes us to our Financial Objective of increasing our Financial Strength, allowing us to sustain further improvement.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P44_S0	2015 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2015 was at 98.9% of target for EBITDA, and below target for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P44_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,222.2 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 8 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2015 of 75.6% under the annual incentive plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P45_S0	For 2015, individual target incentive levels for the annual incentive plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2015 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the executive s level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P45_S1	Target annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for participating executives remained unchanged from 2014 levels.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P45_S2	The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P46_S0	An executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on an assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P46_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met or exceeded by each executive, small adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of the Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P46_S2	The Committee similarly recommended an award amount for the CEO which included a small adjustment for individual performance in 2015 and to recognize that the Company nearly met 2015 annual incentive goals at target.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P46_S3	The adjustments for individual performance did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2015 achievement of the corporate goals.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P46_S4	The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below, which will be paid in March 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P47_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P47_S1	Long-term incentive plan (LTI Plan) awards are denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P48_S0	Performance measures are based on two financial goals, total return (Total Return) and ROE, each measured over a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P48_S1	Total return reflects the change in the value of the Company during the performance cycle plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P49_S0	Achievement of each performance measure during the performance cycle is evaluated independently of the other.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P50_S0	The Committee recommends for Board approval a targeted LTI grant value for each executive, which is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P50_S1	The target LTI grant value is then converted into a target number of units, allocated equally among the two financial goals, based on the unit value on the grant date.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S0	and is calculated annually by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S1	The number of units ultimately earned may range from 0% to 200% of target depending on performance, with the payout being made in cash based on the number of units earned and the per-unit value at the end of the performance period.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S2	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S3	The Committee recommends for Board approval the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating long-term incentive grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S4	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S5	Half of the target units are earned based on Total Return and the other half are earned based on ROE, each over a 3-year performance period.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P51_S6	These metrics and weightings have remained unchanged since the 2012 - 2014 grant cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P52_S0	2015-2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Awards and Performance Goals Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2015-2017 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P52_S1	Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2015-2017 performance cycle were 200% of base salary for Ms. Harris and 95% for Mr. Doyle, Mr. Secrist, Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2014-2016 performance cycle, except for Ms. Harris.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P52_S2	The Board approved an increase in Ms. Harris target award from 170% to 200% to provide a target level of award that was market competitive.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P52_S3	The total number of target LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer for the 2015-2017 performance cycle is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $44.53.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P52_S4	Details of the number of units granted and expected values at target, threshold and maximum performance levels can be found in the 2015 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S0	Effective with the 2015-2017 LTI Plan grants, the Board approved a change in the calculation of performance results.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S1	Under this change, actual performance is measured as a percentage of target performance and plan funding is based on the modified payout scales shown below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S2	Target Total Return will be set annually by the Board prior to the grant date, and was set at 9.8% for the 2015-2017 performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S3	Target ROE remains based on the ROE target in the Board s approved budget for each year.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S4	Prior outstanding LTIP grants continue to have the performance targets and payout scales in effect at the time of grant.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S5	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2015-2017 performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P53_S6	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P54_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P54_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P55_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2013-2015 performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P55_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P56_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year 2013-2015 performance period.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P56_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P59_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the three-year performance cycle was a compounded annual rate of 8.32%, below the target but above the threshold needed for payment.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P59_S1	The Total Return Component funded at 66.3% of target units.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P60_S0	Performance on the ROE component of the grant was an average of target minus 10.7 basis points for funding at 95.73% of target units.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P61_S0	The table below summarizes the status of the two other outstanding performance cycles from the initial grant date to December 31, 2015, with the projected payout assuming this same performance for the full three-year cycle under the applicable payout scales for Total Return and ROE:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P62_S0	The Company maintains the SERP to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P62_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P63_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P63_S1	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2015 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P64_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P64_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P64_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P65_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P65_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P65_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2015 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P66_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company) and Mr. Secrist (who was not then an officer).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P66_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control and provide severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment within two years of a change in control.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P66_S2	Since 2009, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P66_S3	Mr. Bussey was an officer of PSE at March 30, 2009, but left PSE in May 2009 and upon his rehire in March 2012 does not have an employment agreement with the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P67_S0	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P67_S1	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the current arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P68_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services and business club memberships up to an annual limit.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for personal use of club facilities.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P69_S8	Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received, with no corresponding gross-up by the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P70_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P71_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value opportunities for both annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P71_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P72_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P73_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P74_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a significant factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P74_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P75_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of Company goals.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P75_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P75_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P75_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P76_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P76_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P76_S2	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P76_S3	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P77_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P78_S0	The following information is provided for the year ended December 31, 2015 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P78_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey are executives of PSE only.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P78_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P79_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P80_S0	___________________ For 2015, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2015 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2013-2015 performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P80_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2016 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P80_S2	The 2015 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2016.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P81_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P81_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P81_S2	In 2015, updated interest rates and updated mortality assumptions have decreased the actuarial value of the underlying retirement benefits relative to assumptions for 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P81_S3	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2015 Pension Benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P81_S4	The change in pension value amounts for 2015 are: Ms. Harris, $153,818; Mr. Doyle, $360,012; Ms. Mellies, $143,230; Mr. Bussey, $408,937; and Mr. Secrist, $95,399.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P82_S0	Also included in this column are the portions of Deferred Compensation Plan earnings that are considered above market.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P82_S1	These amounts for 2015 are: Ms. Harris, $3,259; Mr. Doyle, $0; Ms. Mellies, $456; Mr. Bussey, $0; and Mr. Secrist $0.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P82_S2	See the 2015 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table for all Deferred Compensation Plan earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P82_S3	All Other Compensation for 2015 is shown in detail in the table below.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P83_S0	Ms. Harris was promoted to President and CEO from President on March 1, 2011.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P83_S1	Mr. Doyle joined PSE and Puget Energy as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer on November 28, 2011.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P83_S2	Mr. Bussey rejoined PSE as Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer on March 19, 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P84_S0	_______________ Annual reimbursement for financial planning, tax planning, and/or legal planning, up to a maximum of $5,000 for Ms. Harris and $2,500 for the other Named Executive Officers.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P84_S1	This column also includes club use which is primarily for business purposes, but Company club expense is included when the executive is also able to use the club for personal use.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P84_S2	Expenses for personal club use are directly paid by the executive, not PSE.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P85_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P86_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2015 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P87_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2015-2017 performance cycle were equally allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P87_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings during the three-year performance cycle, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P88_S0	2015 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P88_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P88_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P88_S3	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P89_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P89_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P90_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2015 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P90_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are assumed to be 4.0% annually.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P90_S2	The discount assumption is 4.65%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2016 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.34%, 4.03%, and 5.06% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2015).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2014 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2014.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S3	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0% through 2019 and 5.0% annually thereafter, a discount assumption of 4.25% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2015 417(e) unisex mortality table adjusted to reflect RP 2014 with MP-2014 improvements.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.15%, 4.06% and 5.15% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2014).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P91_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2014 were the same as those used for December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P92_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P92_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P93_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P93_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Mr. Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S3	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014 will receive pay credits equal to 4% (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S4	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S5	For 2015, the limit was $265,000.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S6	For 2016, the limit is $265,000.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S7	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S8	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S9	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P94_S10	For 2015 and 2016, the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S4	This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P95_S7	As of December 31, 2015, all the Named Executive Officers were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P96_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P96_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P97_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P97_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P97_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P97_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P97_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P98_S0	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P98_S1	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S2	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S3	However, SERP participants as of December 31, 2012, who have not yet attained age 55, including Ms. Harris and Mr. Secrist, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S4	All the participating Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle, are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P99_S5	However, Ms. Harris must continue Company service through December 31, 2016 in order to vest additional SERP benefit value after December 31, 2012.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P100_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a Named Executive Officer (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (1) below minus the sum of (2) and (3) below: (1) One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P100_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P100_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P101_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P101_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P101_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P102_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P102_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P103_S0	(2) The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P103_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2015 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S4	An executive may also elect to have his or her SERP benefit transferred to the Deferred Compensation Plan and paid in accordance with his or her elections under that plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S5	An executive may elect to have his or her SERP benefit paid, or commence to be paid, upon termination of employment after attaining age 55 but prior to attaining age 62.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S6	The SERP benefit of any executive who receives such early retirement benefits will be reduced by 1/3% for each month that the early commencement date precedes the beginning of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the executive attains age 62.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S7	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S8	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S9	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P104_S10	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P106_S6	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P106_S7	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P106_S8	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2015.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P107_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P107_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P107_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P107_S3	The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P107_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P108_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P108_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P108_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P108_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P108_S4	The 2015 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P109_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P109_S1	Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P110_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P111_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P112_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P112_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P112_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P112_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P113_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P113_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P113_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P114_S0	Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) an involuntary termination without cause or by the executive for good reason not in connection with a change in control; (ii) a change in control; (iii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iv) retirement; (v) disability; or (vi) death.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P115_S0	Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P116_S0	Disability and Life Insurance Plans If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P116_S2	The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P116_S3	The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65% of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P116_S4	The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P117_S0	LTI Plan Awards If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P117_S1	In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based on performance through the prior year.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P117_S2	In the event of a change in control in which awards are not assumed or substituted, outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid on a pro-rata basis at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change in control.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P118_S0	Employment Agreements with Certain Named Executive Officers In March 2009, PSE entered into Executive Employment Agreements (Employment Agreements) with each of Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies (the Covered Executives).
1085392_16_ITEM11_P118_S1	The Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P118_S2	In the event of a termination of employment within two years of a change in control (a Covered Termination), a Covered Executive is eligible to receive the payments described below.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P123_S0	Under the Employment Agreements, cause and good reason have the following meanings:
1085392_16_ITEM11_P124_S0	Cause generally means (i) the willful and continued failure by the Covered Executive to substantially perform the Covered Executive s duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 30 days after written notice of demand for substantial performance has been delivered to the Covered Executive or (ii) the Covered Executive s willfully engaging in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, as determined by the Board after notice to the executive and opportunity for a hearing.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P124_S1	No act or failure to act on the Covered Executive s part is considered willful unless the Covered Executive has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that the Covered Executive s action or failure to act was in the best interests of the Company.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P125_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.
1085392_16_ITEM11_P126_S0	Payments upon Retirement, Disability or Death In the event of a Covered Termination due to voluntary retirement after having attained age 55 with a minimum of five years of service to the Company, a pro-rated Annual Bonus is payable to the Covered Executive.

1085392_16_ITEM11_P129_S0	If any payments paid or payable in connection with a change in control while the Company's stock is not traded on an established securities market or otherwise immediately before such change in control, then the Covered Executive will agree to execute a waiver of any excess parachute payments (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), provided that the Company agrees to seek, but is not required to obtain, shareholder approval of the amount payable in connection with termination of employment, in which case the waived amounts will be restored to the Covered Executive.

1085392_16_ITEM13_P13_S0	Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Independence of the Board The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P13_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, Steven Hooper (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Melanie Dressel (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), and Scott Armstrong (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S0	who: (a) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (b) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (c) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (d) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S1	The Company s definition of "Independent Director" is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S2	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S3	The Boards have also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S4	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P14_S5	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P15_S0	Messrs Hooper and Armstrong, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P15_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P15_S2	Because these relationships either fall within the Boards' categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P16_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_16_ITEM13_P16_S1	Ms. Dressel, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.

1085392_17_ITEM1_P0_S0	General Puget Energy is an energy services holding company incorporated in the state of Washington in 1999.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P0_S1	Substantially, all of its operations are conducted through its regulated subsidiary, PSE, a utility company.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	Puget LNG, was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility at the Port of Tacoma, Washington.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	Puget Energy is owned through a holding company structure by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	All of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	Corporate Strategy Puget Energy is the direct parent company of PSE, the oldest and largest electric and natural gas utility headquartered in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P3_S1	Puget Energy s business strategy is to generate stable earnings and cash flow by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Customers and Revenue Overview PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington in 1960.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE furnishes electric and natural gas service in a territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	The following tables present the number of PSE customers and revenue by customer class for electric and natural gas as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage, affecting PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P6_S2	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P6_S3	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and subsequently often higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and subsequently lower power costs in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P6_S4	While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	The following tables present PSE's capital expenditures for the five-year period ended December 31, 2016, and gross utility plant by category and percentages for the year ended December 31, 2016:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	Employees At December 31, 2016 , PSE had approximately 3,000 full-time equivalent employees.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	Approximately 1,100 PSE employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW) and the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P9_S2	The current contracts with the IBEW and the UA expire on March 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	Puget Energy does not have any employees.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	PSE's employees provide employment services to Puget Energy and charges for their related salaries and benefits at cost.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	Segment Information Puget Energy operates one reportable business segment referred to as the regulated utility segment.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P11_S1	For more information on this segment, see Note 17, "Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Corporate Location PSE s and Puget Energy's principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Part III Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance".
1085392_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	Regulation and Rates PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) which includes the property tax tracker.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S2	The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S3	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S4	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long- term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S5	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S6	In addition, the rate plan (K-Factor) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next General Rate Case (GRC), which was to be filed before April 1, 2016 and was later extended to January 17, 2017, as discussed below.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S7	In the rate plan, increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S8	Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous 12-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward looking 12-month period.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P15_S9	Both allow recovery of expenditures without the lengthy process of a full GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	General Rate Case Filing On March 17, 2016, the Washington Commission approved a joint petition postponing the filing of PSE s GRC until no later than January 17, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	As part of the petition, PSE agreed to update power costs on December 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Centralia PPA compliance filing.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	Additionally, PSE agreed to include in its GRC filing a plan for closure of coal fired steam electric generation facility in Colstrip, Montana (Colstrip) Units 1 and 2, of which PSE owns a 50% interest.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	Monthly allowed revenue per customer includes an automatic annual increase and will continue through December 2017 when new rates go into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission which proposed a weighted cost of capital of 7.74%, or 6.69% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	The requested combined electric tariff changes would result in a net increase of $86.3 million, or 4.1%.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	The requested combined natural gas tariff changes would result in a net decrease of $22.3 million, or 2.4%.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	The filing was subsequently suspended, which means that the final rates granted in the proceeding will go into effect no later than December 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	PSE s GRC filing included the required plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings".
1085392_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	Additionally, PSE s filing contains requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	PSE has requested procedures for an ERF that can be used to update PSE s delivery revenues on an expedited basis following a general rate case proceeding.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	PSE also requested approval to establish an electric CRM similar to its existing natural gas CRM which would allow PSE to obtain accelerated cost recovery on specified electric reliability projects.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P19_S1	This monthly adjustment mitigates the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P19_S2	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	The energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S2	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S3	The allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs will subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S4	The decoupling mechanism will end on December 31, 2017 unless the continuation of the requested mechanism is approved in PSE s 2017 GRC which PSE filed on January 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P20_S5	Decoupling over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after December 31, 2017, even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	Electric Rate Filings Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	The power cost baseline is set in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	The graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	The settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues after its review in the 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	PSE had an annual PCA receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016 , due to under recovering $1.0 million of power costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P27_S1	This compares to an annual PCA receivable of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM1_P27_S2	The change was driven by a decrease in actual costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with realized treasury grants and PTCs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P28_S1	The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P28_S2	The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case A limited-scope proceeding was approved in 2002 by the Washington Commission to periodically reset power cost rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P30_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Natural Gas Rate Filings Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The purpose of the CRM is to recover capital costs related to projects included in PSE's pipe replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P34_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	Natural Gas Conservation Rider The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P35_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual versus forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	For additional information on electric and natural gas rates, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 7 of this report and Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	_______________ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	Average megawatt (aMW) usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	Electric Supply At December 31, 2016 , PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,844 megawatts (MW).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	_______________ It is estimated that the Glacier Battery Storage has delivered approximately 250,000 Kilowatt Hour (kWh) since the end of September 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P43_S0	At December 31, 2016 , PSE owns the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 3,614 MW:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P44_S0	_______________ Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P44_S1	The FERC license authorizes the full 54.4 MW; however, the project's water right issued by the State Department of Ecology limits flow to 2,500 cubic feet and therefore output to 47.7MW.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P45_S0	Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts During 2016 , approximately 13.7% of PSE s energy supply requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P45_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P45_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P45_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE was entitled to purchase portions of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P46_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	PSE has seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for 44 aMW of capacity which expires on July 1, 2017 with no provision to renew this agreement.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	PSE will procure more capacity from Mid-Columbia to recover for this loss of capacity, if needed.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P47_S2	PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas Electric Company for 300 MW of capacity which currently has no set expiration.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	Participation is expected to reduce costs for PSE customers, enhance system reliability, integrate variable energy resources, and leverage geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S2	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S3	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S4	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S5	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S6	In 2016 , PSE had 4,646 MW and 695 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P49_S7	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	During 2016 , approximately 64.0% of natural gas purchased for the power portfolio originated in British Columbia, 20.0% in Alberta and 16.0% in the United States.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P52_S1	The 2015 IRP was filed on November 30, 2015 and identified the following capacity needs:
1085392_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2015 IRP.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P53_S1	In 2015, PSE renewed all the Mid-Columbia transmission available for renewal during the year to meet peak capacity needs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	PSE projects that beginning in 2021 its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	The IRP identifies declining regional surpluses, requiring replacement of supplies to meet projected demands.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P54_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources (primarily wind) and additional base load natural gas-fired generation to meet the growing needs of its customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale market, subject to the sharing bands of the PCA mechanism, at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P55_S1	The IRP will be updated in 2017 and is expected to be filed July 15, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline GP (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	_______________ All peak firm natural gas supplies and storage are connected to PSE s market with firm transportation capacity.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s natural gas system.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S4	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S5	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P61_S6	During 2016 , approximately 56.0% of natural gas purchased by PSE for its natural gas customers originated in British Columbia, 21.0% originated in Alberta and 23 .0% in the United States.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P62_S0	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P62_S1	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P62_S2	Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S2	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity in excess of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S3	Of this total, PSE holds 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers, which represents nearly 42% of PSE's expected near-term peak-day requirement.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S4	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S5	Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 641,000 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P63_S6	In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P64_S1	PSE holds over 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,000 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of one and three years and has rights to extend such agreements.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P64_S2	PSE has temporarily released a portion of its Clay Basin storage services to third parties, and its net storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin is 8.9 million Dth and over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P65_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P65_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S0	During 2014, PSE, working with NWP determined that the pipeline redelivery service to PSE from NWP s Plymouth LNG facility could no longer be considered firm during peak conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S1	As a result, PSE terminated the service agreement effective October 31, 2015 and removed the resource from its natural gas firm portfolio.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S2	In 2015, PSE and NWP negotiated a new contract for Plymouth LNG service for PSE s generation fleet, which provides for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S3	PSE will use the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S4	In addition, PSE acquired 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity for the generation fleet.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P66_S5	The balance of the LNG capacity will be delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE s generation fleet.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P67_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P67_S1	This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system, however, it is temporarily not in-service pending planned environmental, safety, efficiency and reliability upgrades.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P68_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P69_S0	In August 2015, PSE filed a proposal with the Washington Commission to develop a LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Tacoma LNG facility will provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and will provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S0	Following a mediation process and the filing of a settlement stipulation by PSE and all parties, the Washington Commission issued an order on October 31, 2016 that allowed PSE s parent company, Puget Energy, to create a wholly-owned subsidiary, named Puget LNG LLC (Puget LNG).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S1	Puget LNG, which was formed on November 29, 2016, will have the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S2	Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility s expected output to other potential customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S3	Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the Tacoma LNG facility is expected to be operational in 2019.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S4	Pursuant to the Commission s order, Puget LNG will be allocated 57% of the capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility and PSE will be allocated the remaining 43% of the capital and operating costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P70_S5	The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P71_S0	Natural Gas Transportation Capacity PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Spectra's Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P71_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S1	PSE holds approximately 543,000 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S2	In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S3	PSE holds approximately 218,000 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S4	In addition PSE holds over 34,000 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S5	PSE s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from two to 28 years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P72_S6	However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S0	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast s pipeline is 132,000 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to four years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S1	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 86,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to four years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S2	PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 80,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of two to seven years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S3	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to seven years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, has a remaining term of seven years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P73_S5	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of four to seven years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S3	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S4	PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity through capacity release.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P74_S5	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S0	Energy Efficiency PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S3	PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S4	However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P75_S5	To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2013 from the Washington Commission for electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P76_S0	Environment PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P76_S1	See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P77_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P77_S1	All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P77_S2	This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P77_S3	PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P78_S0	thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P78_S1	The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P79_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P80_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P80_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P80_S2	Designations of protected species under these two laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P81_S0	Remediation PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P81_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P82_S0	The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P82_S1	PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P82_S2	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P83_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P83_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P84_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P84_S1	This includes most generation facilities (and all of those with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P85_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P85_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P86_S0	Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P86_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P86_S2	Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P87_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P87_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P87_S2	As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P87_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P87_S4	PSE will also consider the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S0	PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S4	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2015 were 11.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S5	Approximately 41.49% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 5.0 million tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S6	While Colstrip remains a significant portion of PSE s GHG emissions, Colstrip is an important part of the existing diversified portfolio PSE owns and/or operates for its customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P88_S7	Consequently, PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S0	Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules On August 3, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S1	The rule was published on October 23, 2015, and separates standards for new power plants fueled by natural gas and coal.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S2	New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S3	of CO 2 /megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S4	New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P89_S5	of CO 2 /MWh, which is less stringent than the draft rule.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S0	The standard for coal plants would not specifically require Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) but CCS was reaffirmed by the EPA as the best system of emission reductions (BSER).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S1	These 111(b) standards are implemented by the states, but states have limited flexibility to alter the standards set by the EPA.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S2	The EPA announced the final rule for 111(d), the Clean Power Plan rule, on August 3, 2015 and published it on October 23, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S3	The rule included several changes from the draft rule.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S4	Specifically, the EPA excluded energy efficiency from one of four "building blocks" identified in the draft rule, leaving just three building blocks (i) increased efficiency for coal plants, (ii) greater utilization of natural gas plants and (iii) increased renewable sources.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S5	In the final rule, the EPA provided more flexibility in achieving interim goals by phasing in the reduction and giving states the option to set their own interim compliance glide path and pushing the start of compliance to 2022.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S6	The EPA also adjusted the 2012 baseline to address hydroelectricity variability and provided specific CO 2 mass targets by year for each state.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S7	States have broad flexibility to pick a rate-based or mass-based approach and can design compliance options and decide how to allocate credits and whether to allow trading.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S8	The EPA also gave states the option of seeking additional time, if necessary, to formulate a state plan.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S9	States must submit something within one year but can request up to an additional two years for development of a state plan.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P90_S10	Thus, states must submit a plan for implementing CO 2 reductions to the EPA one to three years following issuance of the final rule.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P91_S0	Washington Clean Air Rule The Clean Air Rule (CAR) was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities located within Washington State.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P91_S1	Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P92_S0	CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5% every three years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P92_S1	Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P93_S0	CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P93_S1	CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities' 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P94_S0	On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging CAR.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P94_S1	On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to CAR in Thurston County Superior Court.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P94_S2	While awaiting the outcome of the pending litigation, the Company has undertaken steps to comply with the first compliance period of CAR, which began January 1, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P95_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P95_S1	Compliance, based on a rolling 12-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P96_S0	The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P96_S1	Generating units were given three years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P96_S2	Colstrip met the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases as of April 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P97_S0	Regional Haze Rule On June 15, 2005, the EPA issued the Clean Air Visibility rule to address regional haze or regionally-impaired visibility caused by multiple sources over a wide area.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P97_S1	The rule defines Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) requirements for electric generating units, including presumptive limits for sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide controls for large units.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P98_S0	The final Federal Implementation Plan for Montana (FIP) for Regional Haze was issued in September 2012.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P98_S1	There are no immediate requirements for Units 3 and 4, but Units 1 and 2 will need to upgrade pollution controls to meet new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide limits.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S0	The Sierra Club filed an appeal of the FIP with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) on November 15, 2012 and PPL Montana also filed an appeal as the Colstrip operator.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S1	The case was heard on May 15, 2014 in Seattle, Washington, and the final decision by the Ninth Circuit was issued June 9, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S2	The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the EPA s first phase requirements for Colstrip and found that the EPA had not adequately justified the need for two of the control technologies and remanded these two issues back to the EPA.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S3	The EPA informally indicated that it will wait until the next Regional Haze planning period to reissue a FIP.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S4	The ruling in no way affects the future planning periods for the Regional Haze program or the glide path for the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S5	The current EPA assessment is that the state of Montana will require significant emission reductions to meet the natural visibility goal by 2064 which means additional emission reductions will be necessary in future 10-year planning periods, beginning in the 2018-2028 periods, and there is risk and uncertainty regarding potential costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S6	In July 2016, the EPA proposed to delay new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021 and that proposal is currently awaiting approval, however the end date will remain 2028.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P99_S7	In the meantime, Montana has indicated that they plan to work on and submit a State Implementation Plan for the second planning period.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Subtitle D.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S1	The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S2	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S3	The EPA published another rule, which became effective on October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines contained in the original CCR rule.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S4	The initial rule was self-implementing to be enforced by citizen lawsuits rather than the EPA.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S5	On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed legislation amending RCRA to allow a state to take over the CCR program.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S6	Under the amendment, if a state does not seek approval of a permit program or if the EPA denies a state application, the EPA would be required to adopt a permit program in lieu of the current self-implementing rule, as long as Congress grants the funding for the EPA to do so.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S7	This would not eliminate the threat of citizen lawsuits but could provide more certainty regarding interpretations and ultimate compliance.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P100_S8	If no permit program is in effect in a state, the CCR rule will remain self-implementing.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P101_S0	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P102_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P102_S1	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO).
1085392_17_ITEM1_P103_S0	In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P103_S1	The EPA is using this ANPRM to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P103_S2	The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015 but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P103_S3	According to the EPA, the notice of proposed rulemaking is projected to be published in November 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P103_S4	At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group (USWAG) and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P104_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 2, 2017 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P105_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P106_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 2, 2017 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_17_ITEM1_P107_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	RISKS RELATING TO PSE s REGULATORY AND RATE-MAKING PROCEDURES PSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	PSE's regulatory risks include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S3	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S4	In addition, proceedings with the Washington Commission typically involve multiple stakeholder parties, including consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or decreasing rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P3_S5	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Power costs on the other hand, are normalized for market, weather and hydrological conditions projected to occur during the applicable rate year, the ensuing 12-month period after rates become effective.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its natural gas customers based on historic costs during a particular test year.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	PSE is currently subject to a Washington Commission order that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The Washington Commission previously approved an electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs, along with an ERF, a rate plan and an earnings sharing mechanism that requires PSE and its customers to share in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.77% during the term of the rate plan.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the threshold, even if the other service did not meet the earnings test.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P8_S3	The decoupling mechanism will end on December 31, 2017 unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in PSE's GRC which was filed on January 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, wind-powered and oil-fired generating facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including:
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	If PSE is unable to protect its physical assets from terrorist attacks or its information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	Despite PSE's implementation of security measures, its physical assets and technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and PSE were unable to recover in a timely manner, PSE may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	In addition, these physical asset or cyber-based attacks could disrupt its ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	As a result, PSE endeavors to maintain vigilant security programs and procedures to protect against the continuous threat of physical asset and cyber-based attacks, and as a result, PSE may be required to expend significant dollars and other resources to protect against existing and ensuing threats.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S1	To fulfill these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P20_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates at current levels in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including an emission performance standard provision and the EPA set CO 2 emission standards with specific state goals.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and natural gas infrastructure system.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers and also require significant expenditures by PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P25_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S1	PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to an aging workforce, loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S2	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S3	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P26_S4	Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and natural gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s natural gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Potential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	When a town or city in PSE's service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires PSE's assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that PSE provides.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	Although PSE is compensated in connection with the town or city's acquisition of its assets, any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Technological developments may have an adverse impact on PSE's financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P32_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of April 15, 2018.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There was $12.5 million outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Puget Energy's credit facility includes an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	PSE also has two credit facilities, which provide PSE with access to $1.0 billion in short-term borrowing capability, and include an accordion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facilities to $1.5 billion .
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The two PSE credit facilities mature on April 15, 2019.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P35_S4	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.8 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2016 , had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S4	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P38_S5	PSE may not declare or make any dividend distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing audits related to these taxes.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	In connection with the change in administration in Washington, D.C., there may be a higher likelihood of substantive changes in federal law or regulation, including changes to laws and regulations governing corporate tax, environmental protection, healthcare, and other areas, any of which could affect PSE's operations or financial results.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	However, at this time PSE is unable to speculate as to the likely impact of any such changes.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan to PSE employees and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2017 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Potential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	While management believes the Company has reasonable and prudent insurance coverage and accrues loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Puget Energy's ability to pay dividends may be limited.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0% or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S7	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its' corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S8	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.9% at December 31, 2016 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.2 to 1.0 for the 12 months ended.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P48_S9	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Challenges relating to the construction or future operation of the Tacoma LNG facility could adversely affect the Company s operations.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	PSE and Puget Energy s subsidiary, Puget LNG, currently are constructing the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma, a jointly owned facility intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and to provide LNG as fuel primarily to the maritime market.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility s expected output to other potential customers.
1085392_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	Scheduled to be completed in 2019, delays in the facility s construction and operation or in its ability to timely deliver fuel to customers could expose Puget LNG to damages under one or more fuel supply contracts, which could unfavorably impact Puget Energy s return on investment.
1085392_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Natural Gas Supply.
1085392_17_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_17_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_17_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P0_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings relating to its operations in the normal course of business.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P0_S1	The following is a description of pending proceedings that are material to PSE s operations:
1085392_17_ITEM3_P1_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S0	On March 6, 2013, the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S1	Based on a second amended complaint filed in August 2014, the plaintiffs' lawsuit alleged violations of permitting requirements under the New Source Review/Prevention of Significant Deterioration program of the Clean Air Act arising from projects (plaintiffs initially claimed seventy-three projects, but this was reduced to two projects before trial in May 2016) undertaken at Colstrip during the time period from 2001 to 2012.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S2	On July 12, 2016, PSE reached a settlement with the Sierra Club to dismiss all of the Clean Air Act allegations against the Colstrip Generating Station, which was approved by the court on September 6, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S3	As part of the settlement, PSE agreed, along with Talen Energy (the owner of the other 50% interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2), to retire the two oldest units (Units 1 and 2) at Colstrip in eastern Montana by no later than July 1, 2022.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S4	PSE expects that the Washington Commission will allow full recovery in rates of the net book value (NBV) at retirement and related decommissioning costs consistent with prior precedents.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S5	As a result, PSE has reclassified $176.8 million from a plant asset to a regulatory asset, which represents the expected NBV at retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 2, based on the expected shutdown date of July 1, 2022.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P2_S6	Colstrip Units 3 and 4, which are newer and more efficient, are not affected by the settlement, and allegations in the lawsuit against Colstrip Units 3 and 4 were dismissed as part of the settlement.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P3_S0	While PSE has estimated the asset retirement obligation (ARO) for Colstrip Units 1 and 2, the full scope of decommissioning activities and costs are unknown and will vary from the estimates that are available at this time.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P4_S0	Greenwood On March 9, 2016, a natural gas explosion occurred in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle, WA, damaging multiple structures.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P4_S1	The Washington Commission Staff completed its investigation of the incident and filed a complaint September 20, 2016, seeking from PSE $3.2 million in fines.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P4_S2	As a result, the Washington Commission will initiate a hearing before making a final determination.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2016, PSE has accrued $3.2 million for the fine.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P5_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates CCR's under the RCRA, Subtitle D.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P5_S1	The EPA issued another rule, effective October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines under the CCR rule.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P6_S0	The CCR rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P6_S1	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P7_S0	The initial rule was self-implementing to be enforced by citizen lawsuits rather than the EPA.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P7_S1	On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed legislation amending RCRA to allow a state to take over the CCR program.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P8_S0	in lieu of the current self-implementing rule, as long as Congress grants the funding for the EPA to do so.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P8_S1	This would not eliminate the threat of citizen lawsuits, but could provide more certainty regarding interpretations and ultimate compliance.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P8_S2	If no permit program is in effect in a state, the CCR rule will remain self-implementing.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P9_S0	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P10_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P11_S0	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the ARO.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S0	In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S1	The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S2	PSE filed comments on this rule in December 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S3	The EPA published a final rule on October 23, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S4	The rule is being challenged by other states and parties, and the Supreme Court granted a stay of the rule on February 9, 2016 until the litigation is resolved.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S5	PSE began review of the final rule and is working with key stakeholders in preparation for implementation; but due to the stay, many states, including Montana have put off all discussion of implementation.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S6	However, Washington has moved forward with its own Clean Air Rule.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S7	PSE cannot yet determine how the final rule may impact PSE or its existing generation facilities in states where the Clean Power Plan has been stayed, if at all.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P12_S8	The potential impacts of the Washington Clean Air Rule are described, below.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P13_S0	Washington Clean Air Rule The CAR was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities located within Washington State.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P13_S1	Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P14_S0	CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5% every three years.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P14_S1	Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P15_S0	CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P15_S1	CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities' 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P16_S0	On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging CAR.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P16_S1	On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to CAR in Thurston County Superior Court.
1085392_17_ITEM3_P16_S2	While awaiting the outcome of the pending litigation, the Company has undertaken steps to comply with the first compliance period of CAR, which begins January 1, 2017.

1085392_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P1_S5	Puget Energy s and PSE s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P1_S6	Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P1_S7	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P1_S8	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P2_S2	Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P3_S0	Puget LNG was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P4_S0	All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings).
1085392_17_ITEM7_P5_S0	I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P5_S1	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P6_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P6_S1	PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P6_S3	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P6_S4	Factors affecting PSE's performance, are set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P7_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P7_S1	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Company believes that return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P7_S3	The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P8_S0	PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P8_S1	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (net income divided by average common equity) as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P9_S0	The following table presents PSE s ROE, its return on AMA equity, and it's authorized regulated ROE for 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM7_P10_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Company s 2016 return on AMA equity was 8.9% , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P12_S0	Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $360.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P12_S1	The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P12_S2	The impact on ROE for this variance was 1.0%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P13_S0	Depreciation expense was $10.5 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P14_S0	Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities which totaled $4.3 million.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s 2015 return on AMA equity was 8.3% , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P16_S0	Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $256.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P16_S1	The variance was primarily driven by the unanticipated impacts on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment and lower than anticipated capital spending due to slower than anticipated growth in PSE s service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P16_S2	The impact on ROE for this variance was 1.1%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P17_S0	Utility margins were $6.1 million lower than allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the impacts of warmer than normal weather conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P18_S0	Depreciation expense was $5.2 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P19_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2016 and will continue to do so in future years.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P19_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P19_S2	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P20_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P20_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P21_S0	Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P21_S1	Accordingly, the Company will need to seek rate relief on a regular and frequent basis in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P21_S2	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P21_S3	If the Washington Commission determines that an operating expense or capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such operating expense or capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S0	During 2013, PSE completed an ERF, which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for natural gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S1	The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S2	The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the annual cash payments for the year.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S3	The decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S4	Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S5	The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE s allowed electric and natural gas revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S6	This plan required PSE to file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016 which date was later extended by the Washington Commission to January 17, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S7	Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P22_S8	PSE s mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	Although not specified by Washington state law, the Washington Commission also sets natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P24_S0	General Rate Case Filing On March 17, 2016, the Washington Commission approved a joint petition postponing the filing of PSE s GRC until no later than January 17, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P25_S0	Additionally, PSE agreed to include in its GRC filing a plan for closure of coal fired steam electric generation facility in ColstripColstrip Units 1 and 2, of which PSE owns a 50% interest.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P26_S0	Monthly allowed revenue per customer includes an automatic annual increase and will continue through December 2017 when new rates go into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S0	On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission which proposed a weighted cost of capital of 7.74%, or 6.69% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.8%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S1	The requested combined electric tariff changes would result in a net increase of $86.3 million, or 4.1%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S2	The requested combined natural gas tariff changes would result in a net decrease of $22.3 million, or 2.4%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S3	The filing was subsequently suspended, which means that the final rates granted in the proceeding will go into effect no later than December 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S4	PSE s GRC filing included the required plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings".
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S5	PSE also requested that the Washington Commission offset the regulatory liabilities for PTCs and Grants against the future cost of Colstrip shutdown and remediation in order to prevent future rate increases to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P27_S6	Additionally, PSE s filing contains requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P28_S0	PSE has requested procedures for an ERF that can be used to update PSE s delivery revenues on an expedited basis following a general rate case proceeding.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P28_S1	PSE also requested approval to establish an electric CRM similar to its existing natural gas CRM which would allow PSE to obtain accelerated cost recovery on specified electric reliability projects.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P29_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms are expected to mitigate the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S0	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S1	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S2	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S3	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S4	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S5	The decoupling mechanism will end on December 31, 2017 unless the continuation of the requested mechanism is approved in PSE s 2017 GRC which PSE filed on January 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P30_S6	Decoupling over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after December 31, 2017, even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S0	On April 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, effective May 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S1	The overall changes represent a rate increase for electric customers of $20.8 million, or 1.0%, annually, and a rate increase for natural gas customers of $25.4 million, or 2.8%, annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S2	In addition, PSE exceeded the earnings test threshold for both its electric and natural gas businesses in 2016 and 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S3	As a result, PSE recorded a reduction in electric decoupling deferral and revenue of $11.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, and a reduction in natural gas deferral and revenue of $2.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S4	This was reflected as a reduction to the electric and natural gas rate increases noted above.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S5	As noted earlier, the Company is also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S6	This limitation was triggered for the natural gas residential rate class.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S7	The resulting amount of deferral that was not included in the 2016 rate increase is $28.7 million for natural gas revenue that was accrued through December 31, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P31_S8	This amount may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2017, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the 3.0% cap on decoupling related rate increases.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P32_S0	Due to the 3.0% cap on annual decoupling increases noted above and the growing size of decoupling deferrals, PSE performed an analysis as of December 31, 2016 to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P32_S1	The analysis indicated $19.6 million and $1.3 million of natural gas and electric decoupling revenue, respectively, will not be collected within 24 months.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P32_S2	Therefore, PSE did not recognize this portion of decoupling revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P32_S3	However, once it is determined to be collectible within 24 months, it will be recognized.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	Other Proceedings Microsoft PSE and Microsoft have been in conversations to develop a mechanism to provide open access service to satisfy sustainability objectives.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	To that end, PSE filed a tariff that has strong limitations on eligibility, including a stranded cost amount that Microsoft would be required to pay in order to keep all other customers whole.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P33_S2	The proposed tariff is currently suspended while the Washington Commission undertakes discovery.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P34_S0	On September 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's tariff revision to create an additional voluntary renewable energy product, effective September 30, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P34_S1	This will provide customers with energy choices to help them meet their sustainability goals.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P34_S2	Incremental costs of the program will be allocated to the voluntary participants of the program as is the case with PSE s existing Green Power programs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P35_S0	PSE will initially offer this service to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000,000 kWh) and government customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	Electric Rates Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P36_S1	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P36_S2	Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P36_S3	The graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P37_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P37_S1	The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following scale:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P38_S0	The settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P39_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues after its review in the 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P39_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P40_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P41_S0	Pursuant to the PCA Settlement approved on August 7, 2015, effective January 1, 2017, PSE's fixed costs are no longer tracked in PSE's PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P41_S1	Accordingly, on September 30, 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission which requests deferral of the variances, either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed fixed costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P41_S2	The deferral period requested is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 when rates are in effect from PSE's next GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Commission issued Order No. 01 on November 10, 2016 approving PSE s accounting petition.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P43_S0	PSE had an annual PCA receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016 , due to under recovering $1.0 million of power costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P43_S1	This compares to an annual PCA receivable of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P43_S2	The change was driven by a decrease in actual costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P44_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff On December 22, 2016, the Washington Commission approved the annual true-up and rate filing to PSE's Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff, with an effective date of January 1, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P44_S1	The true-up filing resulted in a total credit of $51.7 million to be passed back to eligible customers over the twelve months beginning January 1, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P44_S2	The total credit includes $38.1 million which represents the pass-back of grant amortization and $13.6 million represents the pass through of interest, in addition to a minor true-up associated with the 2016 rate period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P44_S3	This filing represents an overall average rate increase of 0.3% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P45_S0	Power Cost Update Compliance Filing On September 30, 2016, PSE filed with the Washington Commission the update to power costs under Schedule 95, which was allowed for under Order No. 04 in the 2014 PCORC, and required under the joint petition filed March 9, 2016, seeking to postpone the filing of PSE s GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P45_S1	The filing requested a reduction in Schedule 95 rates of $37.3 million or an overall rate decrease of 1.7% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P45_S2	A corresponding reduction in the PCA Mechanism Baseline Rate used to track the PCA imbalance for sharing was also requested in this filing.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P45_S3	PSE s rate filing became effective on December 1, 2016 by operation of law.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	On April 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to change rates under its electric property tax tracker mechanism, effective May 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	The approved rate change incorporates the effects of an increase to property taxes paid as well as true-ups to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	This represents a rate increase for electric customers of $5.7 million, or 0.3% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P47_S0	Electric Conservation Rider On March 1, 2017, PSE filed with the Washington Commission the annual filing to change rates under its electric conservation rider mechanism, effective May 1, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P47_S1	The proposed rate filing requests estimated program year expenditures as well as a true up for actual costs and collections for the conservation program for the prior period which would result in a rate increase for electric customers of $16.5 million, or 0.7% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P47_S2	On April 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to implement changes to rates under its electric conservation rider mechanism, effective May 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P47_S3	The approved rate change incorporates estimated program year expenditures as well as a true up for actual costs and collections for the conservation program for the prior period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P47_S4	This represents a rate decrease for electric customers of $11.7 million, or 0.5% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Natural Gas Rates Purchased Gas Adjustment On October 27, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's PGA natural gas tariff filing with an effective date of November 1, 2016, which reflects changes in wholesale gas and pipeline transportation costs and changes in deferral amortization rates.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P49_S0	The impact to the PGA rates is an annual revenue decrease of $4.1 million, or 0.4% annually, with no impact on net operating income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P50_S0	Cost Recovery Mechanism On October 27, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's CRM natural gas tariff filing with an effective date of November 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	The purpose of this filing is to recover capital costs related to enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P51_S0	The impact to the CRM rates is an annual revenue increase of $5.6 million, or 0.6% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	On April 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to change rates under its natural gas property tax tracker mechanism, effective May 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	This represents a rate increase for natural gas customers of $3.5 million or 0.4% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Natural Gas Conservation Rider On March 1, 2017, PSE filed with the Washington Commission the annual filing to change rates under its natural gas conservation rider mechanism, effective May 1, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P53_S1	The proposed rate filing requests estimated program year expenditures as well as a true up for actual costs and collections for the conservation program for the prior period which would result in a rate decrease for natural gas customers of $1.0 million, or 0.1% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P53_S2	On April 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's request to implement changes to rates under its natural gas conservation rider mechanism, effective May 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P53_S3	The approved rate change reflects estimated program year expenditures as well as a true up for actual costs and collections for the conservation program for the prior period.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P53_S4	This represents a rate increase for natural gas customers of $2.9 million, or 0.3% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P54_S0	For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P55_S0	Access to Debt Capital PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P55_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P55_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P55_S3	For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P55_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P56_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	PSE's credit facilities mature in 2019 and Puget Energy's senior secured credit facility matures in 2018.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	See discussion on credit facilities in Part II in Item 7, Financing Program - Puget Sound Energy - Credit Facilities and Puget Energy - Credit Facility".
1085392_17_ITEM7_P57_S0	Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P57_S1	These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P57_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P57_S3	PSE must spend significant amounts to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P57_S4	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P58_S0	Other Challenges and Strategies Competition PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; and therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P58_S1	However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers in its service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P58_S2	Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P58_S3	Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P58_S4	In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P59_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P59_S2	Set forth below are the consolidated financial results of PSE for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P60_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P61_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P62_S0	The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P62_S1	Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and natural gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P62_S2	PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P62_S3	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P63_S0	Electric Margin Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P63_S1	The following table displays the details of PSE s electric margin changes from periods 2016 to 2015 and periods 2015 to 2014 :
1085392_17_ITEM7_P64_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P64_S1	As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P64_S2	Electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or electric generation operation and maintenance expense.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P65_S0	2016 compared to 2015 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $110.0 million primarily due to higher residential sales of $77.8 million , increased deferred decoupling revenue of $16.3 million and other electric operating revenue of $12.9 million.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P65_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P66_S0	Electric retail sales increased $81.1 million due to increases in rates and residential exchange credits of $86.4 million which was partially offset by $5.6 million due to lower retail electricity usage for non-residential customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P67_S0	Decoupling revenue increased $16.3 million due to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer as compared to volumetric revenues in 2016 compared to 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P68_S0	Other electric operating revenue increased $12.9 million primarily due to a reduction of amortization of PTC deferral credits of $10.1 million and non-core gas sales of $6.8 million.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P69_S0	Electric Power Costs Electric power costs decreased $40.1 million primarily due to a decrease of $42.6 million of residential exchange credits, an increase of $32.1 million of purchase electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $34.5 million of electric generation fuel expense.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P69_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P70_S0	Purchased electricity expense increased $32.1 million primarily due to a $42.3 million increase in long-term firm and market power purchases, $10.0 million increase in PURPA purchases, partially offset by $26.3 million related to reduced wholesale purchases of power.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P71_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $34.5 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices and burn volumes for our combustion turbine generation plants.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P72_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $42.6 million resulting from lower Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P72_S1	The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P73_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P74_S1	The program is administered by the BPA.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P74_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between the BPA and PSE, the BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P75_S0	2015 compared to 2014 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $44.7 million primarily due to higher residential sales of $57.9 million, higher commercial sales of $43.0 million, partially offset by decreased deferred decoupling revenue and other decoupling revenue of $12.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively and other electric operating revenue of $34.5 million.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P75_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P76_S0	Electric retail sales increased $107.9 million due to increases in rates of $113.5 million due primarily to additional $49.1 million credit provided to customers on Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) gain in 2014, $17.0 million of additional Residential Exchange credits, and $12.9 million additional Renewable Energy Credit (REC) credits in 2014, which was partially offset by $5.6 million due to lower retail electricity usage.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P77_S0	Decoupling revenue resulted in a decrease of $12.1 million due to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer as compared to volumetric revenues in 2015 compared to 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P78_S0	Other decoupling revenue decreased $22.2 million due to $12.8 million recovery from customers and $9.4 million related to over earnings sharing band of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P79_S0	Other electric operating revenue decreased $34.5 million primarily due to a reduction of non-core natural gas sales of $23.8 million and biogas revenues of $10.1 million.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P80_S0	Electric Power Costs Electric power costs increased $11.6 million primarily due to an increase of $14.6 million of purchase electricity costs, an increase of $13.6 million of electric generation fuel costs partially offset by a decrease of $16.6 million of residential exchange credits.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P80_S1	The following items are discussed in detail:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P81_S0	Purchased electricity expense decreased $14.6 million primarily due to a $27.4 million decrease in long-term firm and market power purchases, partially offset by $10.1 million related to the PCA customer portion in 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P82_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $13.6 million primarily due to lower natural gas prices for our combustion turbine generation plants.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P83_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $16.6 million resulting from lower REP credits associated with the BPA REP settlement.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P83_S1	The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P84_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P85_S0	Natural Gas Margin Natural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P85_S1	The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P85_S2	PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over and under recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P85_S3	The following table and discussion highlights significant items that impact natural gas operating revenue and natural gas energy costs which are included in natural gas margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_17_ITEM7_P86_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P86_S1	As reported on PSE s Consolidated Statement of Income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P86_S2	Natural gas margin does not include any allocation for amortization/depreciation expense or natural gas operations and maintenance expense.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P87_S0	2016 compared to 2015 Natural Gas Operating Revenue Natural gas operating revenue decreased $57.0 million primarily due to lower natural gas retail sales revenue of $53.7 million due to a decrease of $90.6 million related to the PGA rate reduction, partially offset by an increase of $41.0 million in gas sales due to higher therms sold.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P87_S1	Commercial and residential customers contributed $32.3 and $18.6 million of the net change, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P88_S0	Natural Gas Energy Costs Purchased natural gas expense decreased $89.4 million due to lower natural gas costs included in PGA rates which was partially offset by an increase in usage of 4.6%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P89_S0	2015 compared to 2014 Natural Gas Operating Revenue Natural gas operating revenue decreased $65.3 million due primarily to lower natural gas retail sales revenue of $62.9 million as a result of lower natural gas therm sales, PGA rate reduction and partially offset by decoupling revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P89_S1	These items are discussed in detail below.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P90_S0	Natural gas retail sales revenue decreased $62.9 million primarily due to a decrease of $57.5 million in natural gas sales due to lower therms sold and $5.4 million due to the PGA rate reduction.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P91_S0	Decoupling revenue resulted in an increase of $22.9 million due to lower volumetric revenues compared to the allowed decoupled revenues per customer.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P92_S0	Other Decoupling revenue decreased $28.2 million due to return of over earnings sharing band of the decoupling mechanism of $10.5 million, 24-month exceeding the collection period for decoupling of $10.0 million and collection from customers of $7.8 million.

1085392_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	Dividend Payment Restrictions Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2 to 1.0.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P149_S2	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.5 to 1.0 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P149_S3	At December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	Other Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	The following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P152_S2	The "current" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P153_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P153_S2	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P153_S3	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	As defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S2	Once billing of additional revenues under the decoupling mechanism is permitted, the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S3	PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S4	However, for GAAP purposes only, the Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P154_S5	Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	Regulatory Accounting As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 in the amount of $1,113.2 million and $653.3 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 of $971.5 million and $663.7 million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P157_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P158_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P158_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P160_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 1, "Business Regulation and Rates".
1085392_17_ITEM7_P161_S0	The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customers' bills through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P161_S1	PSE expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P161_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P162_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P162_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P163_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P163_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P164_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P165_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P166_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P167_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P167_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P167_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P167_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P168_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P168_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (i) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, (ii) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business, (iii) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (iv) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (v) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S2	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $5.2 billion at the October 1, 2016 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S3	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.6 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 43.0% or $1.6 billion.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S4	The income approach and the market approach valuations each resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $5.2 billion.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S5	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 2.6% and 5.7%, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P169_S6	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method, using the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital:
1085392_17_ITEM7_P170_S0	Derivatives ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P171_S0	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P171_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P172_S0	is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P172_S1	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P173_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P173_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P174_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P174_S1	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P174_S2	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P174_S3	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P175_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P176_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P176_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P176_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P177_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P178_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P178_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P178_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P178_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P179_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy had interest rate swap contracts outstanding originally related to its long-term debt.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P179_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" and Note 9, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 10 , "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P180_S0	Fair Value ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_17_ITEM7_P180_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P180_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P180_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P181_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P181_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P181_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk".
1085392_17_ITEM7_P182_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P182_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $14.5 million , $22.9 million and $13.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P182_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 55.5%, 58.5% and 61.5% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P182_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $15.5 million and $16.7 million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P182_S4	In 2017 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $12.7 million and incremental qualified pension income of $14.0 million, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P183_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_17_ITEM7_P183_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.8 million , $5.6 million and $4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P183_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.4 million and $0.5 million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P183_S3	In 2017 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $4.8 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P184_S0	PSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P185_S0	PSE recognized income of $0.5 million , $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P185_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million each year.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P185_S2	In 2017 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.6 million and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P185_S3	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P185_S4	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P186_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P186_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P186_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P186_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P186_S4	During 2016 , the Company made cash contributions of $24.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S0	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan given the recent volatility of the financial markets.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S1	At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Company s qualified pension plan was $32.3 million and $44.2 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 95.0% and 93.1% funded, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S2	As of January 1, 2017 , the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S3	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2017 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $1.9 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S4	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.65% in 2015 to 4.50% in 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S5	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense increased from 4.25% in 2015 to 4.65% in 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S6	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits in 2016 remained unchanged at the 2015 level, or 7.75% .
1085392_17_ITEM7_P187_S7	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits in 2016 and 2015 was 6.75% and 7.00% , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7_P188_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_17_ITEM7_P189_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 , "New Accounting Pronouncements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S3	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options to manage its electric and natural gas portfolio risks.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P1_S5	The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index).
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2016 , the Company had total assets of $ 63.1 million and total liabilities of $ 60.4 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P3_S1	As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P3_S3	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P3_S4	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $20.6 million .
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2016 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	_______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Note 9, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P9_S3	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical natural gas contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P9_S4	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P10_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P10_S2	In order to mitigate concentrated credit risk with a subset of counterparties, PSE executed a futures and cleared swaps agreement in November 2016, with the intent to transact power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) beginning in early 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P10_S3	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P10_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE held approximately $321.1 million in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had six counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	PSE monitors counterparties that are experiencing financial problems, have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies or have changes in ownership.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , approximately 80% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, were entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P15_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P15_S1	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P15_S2	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P15_S3	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P15_S4	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P16_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals by counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P16_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P17_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P17_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P17_S2	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P17_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P18_S1	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P19_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P19_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P19_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P19_S4	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's debt instruments:
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P20_S0	_______________ Due to an accounting principle change, the prior year balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 reflect "debt discount, issuance cost and other" in the carrying amount for PE and PSE which was applied retrospectively.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P21_S0	For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Note 6, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P22_S0	From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2016 was a net loss of $5.4 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P22_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $5.7 million in OCI as of December 31, 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding and PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S4	At December 31, 2016 , the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a $0.1 million pre-tax loss, and matured in January 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S5	The fair value considers the risk of Puget Energy s non-performance by using its incremental borrowing rate on unsecured debt over the risk-free rate in the valuation estimate.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P23_S6	Currently, all changes in market value are recorded in earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM7A_P24_S0	The change in fair value of Puget Energy s outstanding interest rate swaps from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2016 is summarized in the table below:

1085392_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	Basis of Presentation Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	In 2009, Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings), owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors, completed its merger with Puget Energy (the merger).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	As a result of the merger, all of Puget Energy s common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P32_S2	The acquisition of Puget Energy was accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), as of the date of the merger.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P32_S3	ASC 805 requires the acquirer to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the merger date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiaries.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P33_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P33_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.

1085392_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and PSE s financial statements do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	Change in Accounting Principle On January 1, 2016, the Company changed its method of presenting unamortized debt issuance costs in the balance sheet.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The new method of presenting debt issuance costs was adopted to comply with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-03, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	ASU 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P36_S3	The prior year comparative balance sheet has been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P36_S4	Due to the change in accounting principle, the December 31, 2015 financial statement line item Other long-term assets decreased and Debt discount, issuance costs and other increased 38.4 million and 30.0 million at Puget Energy and PSE, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Utility Plant Puget Energy and PSE capitalize, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	Replacements of minor items of property are included in maintenance expense.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P37_S3	When the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	Planned Major Maintenance Planned major maintenance is an activity that typically occurs when PSE overhauls or substantially upgrades various systems and equipment on its natural gas fired combustion turbines on a scheduled basis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	Costs related to planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major maintenance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	Non-Utility Property, Plant and Equipment For PSE, the costs of other property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P39_S2	Replacements of minor items are expensed on a current basis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired, which were previously recorded in utility plant, are apportioned between regulatory assets/liabilities and earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P40_S1	However, gains and losses on assets sold or retired, not previously recorded in utility plant, are reflected in earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	Depreciation and Amortization For financial statement purposes, the Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P41_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P41_S2	The depreciation of vehicles and equipment is allocated to the asset and expense accounts based on usage.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P41_S3	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.8% , for each of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ; depreciable natural gas utility plant was 3.4% , for each of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 ; and depreciable common utility plant was 9.7% , 8.5% and 8.5% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated primarily on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (ASC 350), requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a two-step process.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	The first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit with its fair value, with a carrying value higher than fair value indicating potential impairment.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P48_S2	If the first step test fails, the second step is performed.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P48_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2016 using an October 1, 2016 measurement date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P50_S1	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using both discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P50_S2	Such approaches are considered methodologies that market participants would use.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P50_S3	This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Changes in these estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P51_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P51_S4	There were no known events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2016 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P52_S1	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are reported at cost and approximate fair value, due to the short-term maturity.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Fuel and Natural Gas Inventory Fuel and natural gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	Natural gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P54_S3	Puget Energy and PSE record these items at the lower of cost or market value using the weighted-average cost method.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P55_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains and losses that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P55_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term due to the length of the amortization.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	For further details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Puget Energy recorded regulatory assets and liabilities at the time of the merger related to power purchase contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending primarily upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant; the AFUDC debt portion is credited to interest expense, while the AFUDC equity portion is credited to other income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	The current AFUDC rate authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility plant additions as of July 1, 2013 is 7.77% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P59_S2	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P59_S3	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $235.3 million , $234.2 million and $231.7 million for 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	The non-utility subsidiary recognizes revenue when services are performed or upon the sale of assets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery under alternative revenue recognition standard.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	To record revenues under this program, the Company must be able to collect the revenue within 24 months based on alternative revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	Decoupled rate increases are effective May 1 of each year subject to a 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S5	Any excess revenue above 3.0% will be included in the following year's decoupled rate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S6	The Company will be able to recognize revenue below the 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S7	For revenue deferrals exceeding the annual 3.0% rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, the Company will assess the excess amount to determine its ability to be collected within 24 months.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S8	For GAAP purposes only, the Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P64_S9	Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	with energy costs under the power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P66_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P66_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P66_S3	The Company s balance for allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $9.8 million each year.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	Self-Insurance PSE is self-insured for storm damage and environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	In addition, PSE is required to meet a deductible for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The Washington Commission has approved the deferral of certain uninsured qualifying storm damage costs that exceed $8.0 million which will be requested for collection in future rates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy's and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings, who is the ultimate tax payer.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P70_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE purchases natural gas for its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P71_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the natural gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P71_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	PSE records the benefit of the PTCs as a deferred credit until such time as PSE utilizes the tax credit on its tax return.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	Once utilized, PSE will reclassify the credits to a regulatory liability and pass the benefit to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P74_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P75_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P75_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for natural gas related derivatives due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P76_S0	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P76_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P76_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P77_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P77_S1	When these contracts are settled, the contract price becomes part of purchased electricity or electric generation fuel which becomes part of PSE s PCA mechanism and the unrealized gain or loss is listed separately under energy costs, as it represents the non-rate treatment of energy costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P78_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding originally related to its long-term debt.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P78_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 , "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S1	As permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P79_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P80_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P80_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 , "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P81_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P81_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P82_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P82_S1	ASU 2014-09 and the related amendments outline a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P83_S0	The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P83_S1	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date," deferring the effective date for ASU 2014-09 to fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S1	In addition to the FASB's deferral decision, FASB provided reporting entities with an option to adopt ASU 2014-09 for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016, the original effective date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S2	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S3	Reporting entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S4	At this time, the Company has not yet selected a transition method; however, it is in the process of completing its analysis and expects to decide in early 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S5	Additionally, the Company initiated a steering committee and project team to evaluate the impact of this standard, update any policies and procedures that may be affected, and implement the new revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S6	After a substantial evaluation of this standard, the Company does not anticipate significant impacts to its results of operations or on its consolidated financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S7	The Company is still waiting on the resolution of certain industry implementation issues, including contributions in aid of construction (CIAC), to determine the full impact.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P84_S8	The Company is anticipating additional disclosures related to the implementation of the new standard.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P85_S0	Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P85_S1	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S0	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S1	This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S2	Earlier adoption is permitted for all entities upon issuance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S3	Reporting entities must apply a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S4	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P86_S5	At this time, the Company plans to initiate a steering committee and project team to evaluate the impact this standard will have on its results of operations and consolidated financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P87_S0	Derivatives and Hedging In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P87_S1	Topic 815 requires that embedded derivatives be separated from the host contract and accounted for separately as derivatives if certain criteria are met, including the clearly and closely related criterion.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P87_S2	ASU 2016-06 clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P87_S3	An entity performing the assessment under the amendment is required to assess the embedded call or put options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P88_S0	This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P88_S1	Earlier adoption is permitted for all entities upon issuance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P88_S2	Reporting entities must apply a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P88_S3	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-06 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P88_S4	The Company anticipates the new guidance will not have a significant impact on its financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P89_S0	Statement of Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P90_S0	made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distribution received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interest in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P90_S1	Current GAAP is unclear or does not include specific guidance on the eight cash flow classification issues included in the amendments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P90_S2	This update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities upon issuance.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S1	The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-15 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and is in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S3	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S4	The amendments in this update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S5	The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P91_S6	The Company plans to adopt ASU 2016-18 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and does not anticipate the new guidance will have a significant impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P92_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Regulatory accounting allows PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P92_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P93_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 included the following:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P94_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions or awaiting regulatory approval in a future Washington Commission rate proceeding.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P94_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P94_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P95_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P96_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write-off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P96_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P97_S0	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO), PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $369.3 million and $347.5 million in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P97_S1	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S0	2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S1	The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) which is limited in scope and rate impact, includes the property tax tracker, and is intended to establish baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanisms are to operate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S2	The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S3	On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S4	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S5	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S6	In addition, the rate plan (K-Factor) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next General Rate Case (GRC), which was filed on January 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P98_S7	In the rate plan, increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P99_S0	General Rate Case Filing On March 17, 2016, the Washington Commission approved a joint petition postponing the filing of PSE s GRC until no later than January 17, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P99_S1	As part of the petition, PSE agreed to update power costs on December 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Centralia PPA compliance filing.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P99_S2	Additionally, PSE agreed to include in its GRC filing a plan for closure of coal fired steam electric generation facility in Colstrip, Montana (Colstrip) Units 1 and 2, of which PSE owns a 50% interest.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P99_S3	Monthly allowed revenue per customer includes an automatic annual increase and will continue through December 2017 when new rates go into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P100_S0	On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission which proposed a weighted cost of capital of 7.74% , or 6.69% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P100_S1	The requested combined electric tariff changes would result in a net increase of $86.3 million or 4.1% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P101_S0	changes would result in a net decrease of $22.3 million , or 2.4% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P101_S1	The filing was subsequently suspended, which means that the final rates granted in the proceeding will go into effect no later than December 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P101_S2	PSE s GRC filing included the required plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, see Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P101_S3	Additionally, PSE s filing contains requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P102_S0	PSE has requested procedures for an ERF that can be used to update PSE s delivery revenues on an expedited basis following a GRC proceeding.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P102_S1	PSE also requested approval to establish an electric CRM similar to its existing natural gas CRM which would allow PSE to obtain accelerated cost recovery on specified electric reliability projects.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P103_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms are expected to mitigate the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S1	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues will be recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S2	The energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S3	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S4	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover or refund the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue to affected customers over a 12-month period beginning the following May.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S5	The decoupling mechanism will end on December 31, 2017 unless the continuation of the requested mechanism is approved in PSE's 2017 GRC which PSE filed on January 13, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P104_S6	Decoupling over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after December 31, 2017, even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P105_S0	The Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P106_S0	As part of the April 22, 2015 filing, PSE requested to change the methodology of how decoupling deferrals are calculated going forward and adjust deferrals calculated in 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P106_S1	The change was done to ensure that the amortization of prior years accumulated decoupling deferrals were not included in the calculation of the current year decoupling deferrals.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P106_S2	The effect of the methodology change was a reduction of approximately $12.0 million of previously recognized revenue from May through December of 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P106_S3	In addition, PSE exceeded the earnings test threshold in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P106_S4	The amount of the reduction to the 2016 decoupling deferral will not be known until the final earnings test result is filed in PSE's decoupling mechanism filing that will be made on March 31, 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P107_S0	PSE recorded the following reductions in decoupling deferrals to the electric and natural gas rate increases above:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P108_S0	As noted earlier, the Company is also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P108_S1	This limitation has been triggered as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P109_S0	Existing deferrals may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2018, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the 3.0% cap on decoupling related rate increases.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P110_S0	The Washington Commission issued a GRC order that defined deferrable catastrophic/extraordinary losses and provided that costs in excess of $8.0 million annually may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P110_S1	In 2016 and 2015 , PSE incurred $22.0 million and $33.6 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $12.4 million was deferred in 2016 and $22.4 million was deferred in 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P111_S0	Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P111_S1	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P111_S2	Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P112_S0	The graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P113_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P113_S1	The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P114_S0	The settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P115_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues after its review in the 2017 GRC.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P115_S1	If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P116_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P117_S0	PSE had an annual PCA receivable during the year ended December 31, 2016 , due to under recovering $1.0 million of power costs of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P117_S1	This compares to an annual PCA receivable of $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P117_S2	The change was driven by a decrease in actual costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P118_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P119_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case and Update Compliance Filing The following table sets forth PCORC and update compliance filing rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P120_S0	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P121_S0	The following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P122_S0	Accounting Orders and Petitions PSE completed the sale of its electric infrastructure assets located in Jefferson County and the transition of electrical services in the county to Jefferson County Public Utility District (JPUD) on March 31, 2013.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P122_S1	The proceeds from the sale exceeded the transferred assets' net carrying value of $46.7 million resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $60.0 million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P122_S2	A final order was rendered on September 11, 2014 which authorized PSE to retain $7.5 million of the gain and return $52.7 million to customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P122_S3	The customer portion was booked to a regulatory liability account in other current liabilities and accrued interest at PSE's after-tax rate of return.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P122_S4	PSE paid this amount to customers through a bill credit in the month of December 2014.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P123_S0	The following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P124_S0	The following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P125_S0	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P126_S0	The following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding annual impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P127_S1	The Company has been named by the environmental protection agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P128_S0	PSE has implemented an ongoing program to test, replace and remediate certain underground storage tanks (UST) as required by federal and state laws.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P128_S1	The UST replacement component of this effort is finished, but PSE continues its work remediating and/or monitoring relevant sites.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P129_S0	During 1992, the Washington Commission issued orders regarding the treatment of costs incurred by the Company for certain sites under its environmental remediation program.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P129_S1	The orders authorize the Company to accumulate and defer prudently incurred cleanup costs paid to third parties for recovery in rates established in future rate proceedings, subject to Washington Commission review.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P130_S0	The Washington Commission consolidated the natural gas and electric methodological approaches to remediation and deferred accounting in an order issued October 8, 2008.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P131_S0	In accordance with the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly basis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $38.0 million for natural gas and $6.2 million for electric.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S1	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S2	The Company is also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and Bellingham, Washington.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S3	The Company has taken the lead for both projects, and as of December 31, 2016 , the Company s share of future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $24.9 million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S4	The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are $13.8 million , $14.0 million and $13.4 million at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S5	The Company's deferred natural gas environmental costs are $60.7 million , $52.9 million , and $52.6 million at December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P132_S6	In the pending GRC, the Company has requested to ratebase remediation costs incurred, net of insurance, and third party recoveries.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P133_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P133_S1	At December 31, 2016 , approximately $532.9 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P134_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P134_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P134_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.9% at December 31, 2016 , and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.2 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P135_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P135_S1	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P135_S2	Pursuant to the merger order, Puget Energy may not declare or make a distribution unless on such date Puget Energy s ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P135_S3	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.5 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P135_S4	At December 31, 2016 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P136_S0	The following table presents electric, natural gas and common utility plant classified by account:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P137_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost at the Company's ownership share.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P137_S1	The following table indicates the Company s percentage ownership and the extent of the Company s investment in jointly owned generating plants in service at December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P137_S2	These amounts are also included in the Utility Plant table above.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P138_S0	Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has recorded liabilities for steam generation sites, combustion turbine generation sites, wind generation sites, distribution and transmission poles, gas mains, and leased facilities where disposal is governed by ASC 410 ARO .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P139_S0	On April 17, 2015, the United States EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P139_S1	The CCR ruling requires the Company to perform an extensive study on the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P139_S2	The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash surface impoundments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P139_S3	The CCR rule and two new legal agreements which include a consent decree with the Sierra Club and a settlement agreement with the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation in 2016 make significant changes to the Company s Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P140_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation in 2003 under EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P140_S1	Due to the updated Colstrip information, additional disposal costs were added to the ARO.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P140_S2	During the third quarter 2016, PSE entered into two new legal agreements requiring the Company to close the Colstrip 1 and 2 plants on or before July 1, 2022 and to incur additional monitoring costs, water treatment costs, forced evaporation cost, and post closure care costs for all Colstrip Units.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P140_S3	As a result, the Company adjusted the Colstrip ARO ending liability to increase by $45.7 million for Colstrip 1 and 2 and $37.0 million for Colstrip 3 and 4.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P141_S0	The actual ARO costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P141_S1	We will continue to gather additional data and coordinate with the plant operator to make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P141_S2	As additional information becomes available, the Company will update the ARO obligation for these changes, which could be material.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P141_S3	During the first quarter 2016, the Company updated its estimated decommissioning costs due to the timing of its ARO for Lower Snake River and Hopkins Ridge wind generation sites and increased the ARO liability of $19.7 million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table describes the changes to the Company s ARO liability as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, ARO, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2016 due to:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P144_S0	A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P145_S0	An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P146_S0	An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P147_S0	A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground fuel storage tanks.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P148_S0	An obligation to pay decommissioning costs at the end of utility service franchise agreements to restore the surface of the franchise area.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P149_S0	A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if FERC orders the project to be decommissioned, although PSE contends that FERC does not have such authority.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P149_S1	Given the value of ongoing generation, flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and cannot be reasonably estimated.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P150_S0	The following table presents outstanding long-term debt principal amounts and due dates as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P151_S0	PSE's senior secured notes will cease to be secured by the pledged first mortgage bonds on the date that all of the first mortgage bonds issued and outstanding under the electric or natural gas utility mortgage indenture have been retired.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P151_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the latest maturity date of the first mortgage bonds, other than pledged first mortgage bonds, is December 22, 2025.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P152_S0	Puget Sound Energy Long-Term Debt PSE has in effect a shelf registration statement ("the existing shelf") under which it may issue, as of the date of this report, up to $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P152_S1	The existing shelf will expire in November 2019.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P153_S0	Substantially all utility properties owned by PSE are subject to the lien of the Company s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P153_S1	To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE s earnings available for interest must exceed certain minimums as defined in the indentures.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P153_S2	At December 31, 2016 , the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P154_S0	On May 26, 2015, PSE issued $425.0 million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P154_S1	The notes mature in May 2045 and have an interest rate of 4.30% , which is payable semi-annually in May and November.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P154_S2	Net proceeds of the issuance were used to fund the early retirement, including accrued interest and make-whole call premiums, of the Company's $150.0 million 5.197% senior notes maturing in October 2015 and the Company's $250.0 million 6.75% senior notes maturing in January 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P155_S0	Puget Energy Long-Term Debt In May 2015, Puget Energy issued $400.0 million of senior secured notes in a private placement.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P155_S1	The notes mature in May 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.65% , which is payable semi-annually in May and November.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P155_S2	Net proceeds of the issuance were used to repay outstanding Puget Energy indebtedness and to fund a special dividend to shareholders.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P156_S0	In November 2015, Puget Energy exchanged $400.0 million of its 3.65% senior secured notes that were originally issued in the May 2015 private placement for registered notes of the same amount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P157_S0	The principal amounts of long-term debt maturities for the next five years and thereafter are as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P158_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , PSE had $245.8 million and $159.0 million in short-term debt outstanding, respectively, exclusive of the demand promissory note with Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P158_S1	Outside of the consolidation of PSE s short-term debt, Puget Energy had no short-term debt outstanding in either year as borrowings under its credit facilities are classified as long-term.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P158_S2	PSE s weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt, including borrowing rate, commitment fees and the amortization of debt issuance costs, during 2016 and 2015 was 3.21% and 4.24% , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P158_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE and Puget Energy had several committed credit facilities that are described below.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P159_S0	Puget Sound Energy Credit Facilities PSE has two unsecured revolving credit facilities which provide, in aggregate, $1.0 billion of short-term liquidity needs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P159_S1	These facilities consist of a $650.0 million revolving liquidity facility (which includes a liquidity letter of credit facility and a swingline facility) to be used for general corporate purposes, including a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program and a $350.0 million revolving energy hedging facility (which includes an energy hedging letter of credit facility).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P159_S2	The $650.0 million liquidity facility includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $75.0 million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P159_S3	The credit facilities also have an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of these facilities to $1.5 billion .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P159_S4	In April 2014, the Company completed a one-year extension on both of the liquidity and hedging facilities, extending the maturity from February 2018 to April 2019, and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facilities from when they were committed in 2013.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S0	The credit agreements are syndicated among numerous lenders and contain usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, place limitations on PSE's ability to transact with affiliates, make asset dispositions and investments or permit liens to exist.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S1	The credit agreements also contain a financial covenant of total debt to total capitalization of 65% or less.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S2	PSE certifies its compliance with such covenants to participating banks each quarter.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE was in compliance with all applicable covenant ratios.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S4	The credit agreements provide PSE with the ability to borrow at different interest rate options.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S5	The credit agreements allow PSE to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a spread that is based upon PSE's credit rating.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P160_S6	PSE must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P161_S0	spreads and the commitment fee depend on PSE's credit ratings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P161_S1	As of the date of this report, the spread to the LIBOR is 1.75% and the commitment fee is 0.275% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P161_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , no amounts were drawn under either PSE's $650.0 million facility or PSE's $350.0 million energy hedging facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P161_S3	No letters of credit were outstanding under either facility, and $245.8 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P161_S4	Outside of the credit agreements, PSE had a $3.5 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P162_S0	Demand Promissory Note PSE entered into a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy, in the form of a credit agreement and a demand promissory note (Note) pursuant to which PSE may borrow up to $30.0 million from Puget Energy subject to approval by Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P162_S1	Under the terms of the Note, PSE pays interest on the outstanding borrowings based on the lower of the weighted-average interest rates of PSE s outstanding commercial paper interest rate or PSE s senior unsecured revolving credit facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P162_S2	Absent such borrowings, interest is charged at one-month LIBOR plus 0.25% .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P162_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , there was no outstanding balance under the Note.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P163_S0	At December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy maintained an $800.0 million revolving senior secured credit facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P163_S1	In April, 2014, the Company completed an amendment to the senior secured credit facility, extending the maturity from February 2017 to April 2018, updating the fee structure, eliminating a financial covenant and updating or clarifying the definitions of other terms and conditions of the facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P163_S2	The Puget Energy revolving senior secured credit facility also has an accordion feature which, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P163_S3	The revolving senior secured credit facility provides Puget Energy the ability to borrow at different interest rate options and includes variable fee levels.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P163_S4	Interest rates may be based on the bank's prime rate or LIBOR plus a spread based on Puget Energy's credit ratings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P164_S0	Puget Energy must pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P164_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , there was $12.5 million outstanding under the facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P164_S2	As a result of Puget Energy's credit rating upgrade in 2014, the spread over LIBOR was 1.75% and the commitment fee was 0.275% as of the date of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P165_S0	Puget Energy entered into interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate risk associated with the credit facility or similar variable rate debt.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P165_S1	For additional information, see Note 9, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P166_S0	The revolving senior secured credit facility contains usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P166_S1	The agreement also contains a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P166_S2	As of December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P167_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P167_S1	Certain leases contain purchase options, renewal options and escalation provisions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P167_S2	Operating lease expenses net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P168_S0	Payments received for the subleases of properties were immaterial for each of the years ended 2016 , 2015 and 2014 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P168_S1	Future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts are:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P169_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P169_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P169_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and PSE's related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P170_S0	In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P170_S1	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P170_S2	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P171_S0	Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting, and therefore records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S2	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S3	As of December 31, 2016 , Puget Energy had two interest rate swap contracts outstanding which matured January 2017 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S4	Currently, these swap instruments do not hedge any variable interest rate debt.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P172_S5	PSE did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following table presents the volumes, fair values and locations of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P174_S0	_______________ Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P174_S1	Balance sheet location: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P175_S0	Interest rate swap contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P175_S1	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P176_S0	The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P177_S0	It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level, without offsetting assets or liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P177_S1	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements, which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, which standardize financial gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements, which standardize physical gas contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P177_S2	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P178_S0	The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P178_S1	For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P179_S0	The following tables present the potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative assets and liabilities:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P180_S0	_______________ All Derivative Contract deals are executed under ISDA, NAESB and WSPP Master Netting Agreements with Right of set-off.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P180_S1	Interest Rate Swap Contracts are only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P181_S0	The following tables present the effect and locations of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) of the Company's derivatives recorded on the statements of income:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P182_S0	_______________ Differences between Puget Energy and PSE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are due to certain derivative contracts recorded at fair value in 2009 and subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P182_S1	These differences occurred through February 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P184_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P184_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, exposure monitoring and exposure mitigation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P184_S2	The Company monitors counterparties that have significant swings in credit default swap rates, have credit rating changes by external rating agencies, have changes in ownership or are experiencing financial distress.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P184_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P184_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P185_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P185_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P185_S2	However, as of December 31, 2016 , approximately 93.1% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding NPNS transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies and 6.9% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P186_S1	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P186_S2	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P187_S0	that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P187_S1	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P188_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P188_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P188_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P189_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P189_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P190_S0	Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P190_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , the Company was in a net asset position with the majority of counterparties, however, the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P191_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P191_S1	As of December 31, 2016 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P191_S2	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 , nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P192_S0	The table below presents the fair value of the overall contractual contingent liability positions for the Company's derivative activity:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P193_S0	_______________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P193_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P194_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P194_S1	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in the forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P195_S0	ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P195_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P195_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P196_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P196_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P196_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P197_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P198_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P198_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P199_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P199_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P200_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P200_S1	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P201_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P201_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P201_S2	Inputs used to estimate the fair value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves; contract terms and prices; credit-risk adjustments; and discount factors.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P201_S3	Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P202_S0	Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs because substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P203_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P203_S1	For interest rate swaps, the Company obtains monthly mark-to-market values from an independent external pricing service for LIBOR forward rates, which is a significant input.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P203_S2	Some of the inputs of the interest rate swap valuations, which are less significant, include the credit standing of the counterparties, assumptions for time value and the impact of the Company's nonperformance risk of its liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P204_S0	The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash as Level 1 financial instruments due to cash being at stated value, and cash equivalents at quoted market prices.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P204_S1	The Company considers its electric, natural gas and interest rate swap contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P204_S2	Management's assessment was based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P205_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices (e.g., Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P205_S1	However, certain energy derivative instruments with maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P206_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term debt as reported on the balance sheet are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P206_S1	The carrying value of other investments of $49.1 million and $52.8 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, are included in other property and investments on the balance sheet.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P206_S2	These values are also reasonable estimates of their fair value and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on market rates for similar transactions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P206_S3	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P206_S4	Carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P207_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P208_S0	_______________ Income Statement location: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P208_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $2.0 million , $(7.4) million and $(9.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P208_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P209_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P210_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P211_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P212_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P212_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P213_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P213_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2016 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	At December 31, 2016 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $0.2 million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P217_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P217_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	During 2016 and 2015 , Puget Energy completed valuation and impairment testing of its power purchase contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	In 2016 and 2015 , due to decreases in forecasted revenue and cost estimates and continued significant decreases in forward power prices, the following impairments were recorded to the Company's intangible asset contracts, with corresponding reductions to the regulatory liability as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	The valuations were measured using a discounted cash flow, income-based valuation methodology.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract pricing which provided future net cash flow estimates which are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P221_S2	A less significant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P221_S3	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the impaired long term power purchase contracts' fair value in 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Company's Investment Plan is a qualified employee 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $17.2 million , $16.1 million and $14.9 million for the years 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P223_S1	Non-represented employees and United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (UA) represented employees hired before January 1, 2014, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 (IBEW) represented employees hired before December 12, 2014, have the following company contributions:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1% of base pay.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55% of an employee s contribution up to 6% of plan compensation each paycheck.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will have access to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	The two contribution sources from PSE are below:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	401(k) Company Matching: New non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive company match each paycheck based on a new schedule- 100% match on the first 3% of pay contributed and 50% match on the next 3% of pay contributed.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	An employee who contributes 6% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P227_S2	Company matching will be immediately vested.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	Company Contribution: New UA-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay placed in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive an annual company contribution of 4% of eligible pay, placed either in the Investment Plan 401(k) plan or in PSE s Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P228_S2	New non-represented and IBEW-represented employees will make a one-time election within 30 days of hire and direct that PSE put the 4% contribution either into the 401(k) plan or into an account in the Cash Balance retirement plan.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P228_S3	The Company s 4% contribution will vest after three years of service.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P229_S0	PSE has a defined benefit pension plan (Qualified Pension Benefits) covering the largest portion of PSE employees.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P229_S1	Pension benefits earned are a function of age, salary, years of service and, in the case of employees in the cash balance formula plan, the applicable annual interest crediting rates.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P229_S2	Starting with January 1, 2014, all non-represented and UA-represented employees, along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014 who elect to accumulate the Company contribution in the cash balance formula portion of the pension plan, will receive annual pay credits of 4% each year.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P229_S3	They will also receive interest credits like other participants in the cash balance pension formula of the pension plan, which are at least 1% per quarter.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P230_S0	When an employee with a vested cash balance formula benefit leaves PSE, he or she will have annuity and lump sum options for distribution.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P230_S1	Those who select the lump sum option will receive their current cash balance amount.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S0	PSE also maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for its key senior management employees.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S1	In addition to providing pension benefits, PSE provides legacy group health care and life insurance benefits (Other Benefits) for certain retired employees.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S2	These benefits are provided principally through an insurance company.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S3	The insurance premiums, paid primarily by retirees, are based on the benefits provided during the prior year.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S4	Puget Energy records purchase accounting adjustments associated with the re-measurement of the retirement plans.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P231_S5	The following tables summarize the Company s change in benefit obligation, change in plan assets and amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P232_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and PSE's pension benefit amounts recognized in AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P233_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and PSE's net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P234_S0	The following tables summarize Puget Energy's and PSE's benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S0	The estimated net (loss) gain and prior service cost (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 by PSE are $(13.7) million and $(1.6) million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S1	The estimated net (loss) gain for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 is $(1.6) million .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S2	The estimated prior service cost (credit) for the SERP that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 is immaterial .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S3	The estimated net (loss) gain and prior service cost (credit) for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated OCI into net periodic benefit cost in 2017 is immaterial.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S4	For Puget Energy, the overall amounts expected to be amortized from accumulated OCI into net period benefit cost in 2017 were immaterial.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P235_S5	The aggregate expected contributions by the Company to fund the qualified pension plan, SERP and the other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2017 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $1.9 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P236_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P237_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 8.80% in 2017 grading down to 4.30% in 2018 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P237_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P238_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P238_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is as follows.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P240_S0	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P240_S1	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P241_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P241_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P242_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P242_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P242_S2	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P242_S3	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P243_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid during the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P244_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P244_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P245_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P245_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P246_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P246_S1	Interim evaluations are routinely performed with the assistance of an outside investment consultant.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P247_S0	To obtain the desired return needed to fund the pension benefit plans, the Retirement Plan Committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P248_S0	Plan Fair Value Measurements ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits (ASC 715) directs companies to provide additional disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P248_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (i) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (ii) major categories of plan assets; (iii) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (iv) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P249_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P249_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P250_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 :
1085392_17_ITEM8_P251_S0	_______________ In accordance with ASU 2015-07, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)", certain investments that were measured at NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P251_S1	The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the statement of net assets available for benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P252_S0	Investments measured at NAV consist of common/collective trust funds and two partnerships held as of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P253_S0	Mesirow Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund Partnership, L.P. utilizes a combination of long and short strategies through investments in investment funds.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P253_S1	The major strategy allocations of the investment funds include (1) Investments in debt obligations of public and private entities; typically in financial duress, and (2) Investments in equity positions on a global basis utilizing fundamental analysis.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P254_S0	Grosvenor Institutional Partners Fund, L.P invests substantially all of the fund assets available in the Grosvenor Master Fund, a Cayman Islands exempted company which is sponsored, managed and has the same investment objective as the Partnership fund.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P254_S1	In addition to the Master Fund, investments are made primarily in offshore investment funds, investment partnerships, and pooled investment vehicles; collectively referred to as Portfolio Funds, which generally implement "nontraditional" or "alternative" investment strategies.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P255_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P256_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P256_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P256_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P257_S0	The investment consists of a money market fund (at level 1) and a collective trust fund (at level 2).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P257_S1	The money market fund is valued at the net asset value per share of $1.00 per unit as of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_17_ITEM8_P258_S0	The collective trust fund invests primarily in commercial paper, notes, repurchase agreements, and other evidences of indebtedness which are payable on demand or short-term in nature.

1085392_17_ITEM8_P261_S0	_______________ PSE's Wild Horse wind plant and Hopkins Ridge wind plant earned their last PTCs in December 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P262_S0	The Company s net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2016 and 2015 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S0	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes".
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S1	ASU 2015-17 requires reporting entities to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet instead of separating such deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S2	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S3	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S4	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S5	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P263_S6	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2027 through 2036.

1085392_17_ITEM8_P274_S3	These projects are financed through substantially level debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P274_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_17_ITEM8_P274_S5	The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31:

1085392_17_ITEM11_P1_S0	Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2016 the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P2_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P3_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P3_S1	Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of short and long-term Company goals.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P4_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of the executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (Cook Co.).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P4_S2	The Committee recommends to the full Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by Cook Co., and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P4_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P5_S0	In 2016, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P6_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P6_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with companies of similar size and scope of operations so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P6_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation levels to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets each element of target total direct compensation (the sum of base salary and target annual and long-term incentive award opportunities) to the 50th percentile of the market data with variations by individual executive, as appropriate.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P6_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P6_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P8_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s target total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P9_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business direction as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P9_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and rewarded based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P9_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P11_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive results.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P12_S0	Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P12_S1	The CEO leads talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P12_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P12_S3	Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P12_S4	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S1	The Company also provides certain post-termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S2	Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of non-equity compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S3	The target total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group described below and drive the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S4	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S5	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P13_S6	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2016 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P14_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness To help inform the Committee s recommendations for 2016 base salaries, annual incentive programs and long-term incentive programs, the Committee reviewed market data obtained from both industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of public companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation benchmarking peer group.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P14_S1	The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Towers Watson 2015 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P14_S2	The 24 companies in the custom market survey cut used to inform target compensation decisions for 2016 are:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P15_S0	As noted, the market survey data were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 14 companies, all but four of which overlapped with companies included in the market survey data.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P15_S1	The 2015 median revenue of the executive compensation peers was $3.6 billion, which was comparable to PSE s annual revenues of $3.0 billion at the time the peer group was developed.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P16_S0	As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of industry practice, with deviations by individual executive as described below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P16_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, actual compensation is expected to be below this targeted level and if Company performance exceeds target, actual compensation is expected to be above this targeted level.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P17_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P17_S1	Despite the median philosophy, the Company may choose to target an executive s compensation above or below the 50th percentile of market pay when that individual has a role with greater or lesser responsibility than the best comparison job or when our executive s experience and performance exceed those typically found in the market.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P17_S2	In addition to the foregoing market data, the Committee generally also received advice from Cook Co. in connection with 2016 compensation decisions.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P18_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P19_S0	As mentioned above, base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee based on its median philosophy, internal equity considerations and individual executive considerations such as expertise, level of performance achievement, experience in role and contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S0	Base Salary Adjustments for 2016 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2016 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries as shown in the table below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S2	The adjustments were effective March 1, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S3	Base salaries for 2016 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S4	The annual salary for Ms. Harris is unchanged from 2015, given that her current base salary was slightly higher than the 50th percentile of market among the survey peer group.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P20_S5	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were approximately 3%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees, except for Mr. Secrist who received an additional adjustment to better align with the market levels.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P21_S0	2016 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P21_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P22_S0	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P23_S0	For 2016, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against nine Service Quality Indicators (SQIs) covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P23_S1	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P23_S2	Annual incentive funding is decreased if a SQI is not achieved.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P24_S0	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P24_S1	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P24_S2	The SQIs for 2016 were the same as those in 2015 and were as follows:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P25_S0	Customer Satisfaction (3 SQIs) - Customer satisfaction with the telephone access center and natural gas field services and number of Washington Commission complaints.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P25_S1	Customer Service (2 SQIs) - Calls answered live and on-time appointments.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P26_S0	Safety and Reliability (4 SQIs) - Gas emergency response, electric emergency response, non-storm outage frequency and non-storm outage duration.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P27_S0	In 2016, the Company retained a safety performance measure in the annual incentive plan funding to promote its continued commitment to employee safety.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P27_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the nine SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P27_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P28_S0	The safety performance measure contains four targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P28_S1	The four targets for 2016 were:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P29_S0	All employees attend a monthly safety meeting in a box presentation, or complete the same content online.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P29_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95%.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P30_S0	The Company DART ( D ays A way from Work, days of R estricted Work, or Job T ransfer) not to exceed a rate of 0.52 in 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P31_S0	Field employees to attend the Industrial Athlete program, a new training designed to improve mobility and strengthen stability.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P31_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95% of field employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P32_S0	Office employees to complete an on-line training to increase knowledge and skill in CPR and First Aid.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P32_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95% of office employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P33_S0	In 2016, 100% funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all nine SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P33_S1	All 10 customer service and safety measures were met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P34_S0	Funding levels for 2016 at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P35_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P35_S1	For 2016, the Committee adjusted the level of EBITDA at target lower by $1.1 million to reflect the additional 2016 incentive paid based on 2015 SQI results (see section below 2015 Annual Incentive Review during 2016 ) and keep the 2016 EBITDA performance at the same percentage of target that would have applied absent the payment.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P36_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on an evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals that align with the corporate goals described below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P37_S0	2016 Corporate Goals In 2016, the Company continued using the Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) to summarize for employees the direction and overall goals of the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P37_S1	The plan has five objectives which capture our 2016 corporate goals and which have been communicated to our employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P37_S2	Each employee, including the Named Executive Officers, has specific individual and team goals linked to driving strategies that meet one or more of the following ISP objectives:

1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S0	In March 2016, the Company paid annual incentive awards based on 2015 EBITDA performance of $1,222.2 million (98.9% of target performance) and 8/10 Safety/SQI goals met, for an overall funding level of 75.6% of target, as described in the Company s 2015 Form 10-K. The Company filed for an exception with the Washington Commission for the SQI goal of System Average Interruption Disruption Index (SAIDI), due to extraordinary storm activity during August and November 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S1	On May 12, 2016, the Company received approval to exclude the extraordinary storm activity, resulting in the SQI having been deemed met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S2	With 9/10 Safety/SQI goals met in 2015, the funding for annual goals and incentives would have increased to 84.7% of target.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S3	In light of the approval from the Washington Commission, the Board approved an additional payment in 2016 based on the impact from the SQI being deemed met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S4	Accordingly, employees who received an annual incentive in 2015 and are eligible to receive an annual incentive in 2016 will be paid this additional amount in March 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P43_S5	For the Named Executive Officers, these amounts are included in the Bonus column of the 2016 Summary Compensation Table.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P44_S0	2016 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2016 was at 100.4% of target for EBITDA, and fully met for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P44_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,255.3 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 10 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2016 of 102% for the annual incentive plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P45_S0	For 2016, individual target incentive levels for the annual incentive plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2016 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the executive s level of responsibility within the Company and informed by market data.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P45_S1	Target annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary for Named Executive Officers remained unchanged from 2015 levels.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P45_S2	The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P46_S0	An executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on an assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P46_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, which were determined to be met or exceeded by each executive, adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of certain Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P46_S2	In recognition of the achievement of individual goals and the Company's financial performance, the Committee similarly recommended an award adjustment for the CEO in 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P46_S3	The adjustments for individual performance are noted in the "Bonus" column on the Summary Compensation table and did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2016 achievement of the corporate goals.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P46_S4	The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below, which will be paid in March 2017:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P47_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P47_S1	Long-term incentive plan (LTI Plan) awards are denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P48_S0	Performance measures are based on two financial goals, total return (Total Return) and ROE, each measured over a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P48_S1	Total return reflects the change in the value of the Company during the performance cycle plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P49_S0	Achievement of each performance measure during the performance cycle is evaluated independently of the other.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S0	The Committee recommends for Board approval a targeted LTI grant value for each executive, which is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S1	The target LTI grant value is then converted into a target number of units, allocated equally among the two financial goals, based on the unit value on the grant date.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S2	The initial per-unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings level and is calculated annually by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S3	The number of units ultimately earned may range from 0% to 200% of target depending on performance, with the payout being made in cash based on the number of units earned and the per-unit value at the end of the performance period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S4	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S5	The Committee recommends for Board approval the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating long-term incentive grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S6	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S7	Half of the target units are earned based on Total Return and the other half are earned based on ROE, each over a 3-year performance period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P50_S8	These metrics and weightings have remained unchanged since the 2012 - 2014 grant cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P51_S0	2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Awards and Performance Goals Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2016-2018 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company and the corresponding market data.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P51_S1	Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2016-2018 performance cycle were 220% of base salary for Ms. Harris and 95% for Mr. Doyle, Mr. Secrist, Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2015-2017 performance cycle, except for Ms. Harris.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P51_S2	The Board approved an increase in Ms. Harris target award from 200% to 220% to provide a target level of award that was market competitive.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P52_S0	(converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $48.05.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P52_S1	Details of the number of units granted and expected values at target, threshold and maximum performance levels can be found in the 2016 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S0	Effective with the 2015-2017 LTI Plan grants, the Board approved a change in the calculation of performance results.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S1	Under this change, actual performance is measured as a percentage of target performance and plan funding is based on the modified payout scales shown below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S2	Target Total Return is set annually by the Board prior to the grant date, and was set at 9.7% for the 2016-2018 performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S3	Target ROE remains based on the ROE target in the Board s approved budget for each year.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S4	Prior outstanding LTIP grants continue to have the performance targets and payout scales in effect at the time of grant.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S5	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2016-2018 performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P53_S6	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P54_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P54_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P55_S0	Performance Scales for the 2015-2017 LTI Plan Grant The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2015-2017 performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P55_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P56_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P56_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P57_S0	Performance Scales for the 2014-2016 LTI Plan Grant The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2014-2016 performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P57_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P58_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year 2014-2016 performance period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P58_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P59_S0	Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance 2014-2016 Performance Cycle The 2014-2016 performance cycle has now ended.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P60_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the following table:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P61_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the three-year performance cycle was a compounded annual rate of 8.28%, below the target but above the threshold needed for payment.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P61_S1	The Total Return Component funded at 65.6% of target units.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P62_S0	Performance on the ROE component of the grant was an average of target plus 23 basis points for funding at 109.2% of target units.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P63_S0	The table below summarizes the status of the two other outstanding performance cycles from the initial grant date to December 31, 2016, with the projected payout assuming this same performance for the full three-year cycle under the applicable payout scales for Total Return and ROE:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P64_S0	The Company maintains the SERP to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P64_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P65_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P65_S1	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2016 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P66_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P66_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P66_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P67_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P67_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P67_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2016 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P68_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company) and Mr. Secrist (who was not then an officer).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P68_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control and provide severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment within two years of a change in control.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P68_S2	Since 2009, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P68_S3	Mr. Bussey was an officer of PSE at March 30, 2009, but left PSE in May 2009 and upon his rehire in March 2012 does not have an employment agreement with the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P69_S0	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P69_S1	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the current arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P70_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services and business club memberships up to an annual limit.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for personal use of club facilities.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P71_S8	Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received, with no corresponding gross-up by the Company.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P72_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P73_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value opportunities for both annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P73_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P74_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P75_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P76_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a significant factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P76_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P77_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of Company goals.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P77_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P77_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P77_S3	As a result, the Committee and the Board believe that the programs design do not have risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P78_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P78_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2016, except as noted below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P79_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P79_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P80_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P81_S0	The following information is provided for the year ended December 31, 2016 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P81_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey are executives of PSE only.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P81_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P82_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P83_S0	_______________ For 2016, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2016 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2014-2016 performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P83_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2017 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P83_S2	The 2016 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2017.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P84_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P84_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P84_S2	In 2016, updated interest rate assumptions have increased the actuarial value of the underlying retirement benefits relative to assumptions for 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P84_S3	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2016 Pension Benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P84_S4	The change in pension value amounts for 2016 are: Ms. Harris, $646,248; Mr. Doyle, $370,670; Mr. Secrist, $268,972, Ms. Mellies, $279,410; and Mr. Bussey, $305,837.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P85_S0	Also included in this column are the portions of Deferred Compensation Plan earnings that are considered above market.

1085392_17_ITEM11_P88_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P89_S0	The following table presents information regarding 2016 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P90_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2016 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2016 of $1,125 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P90_S1	Payment would be $0 if either trigger is not met.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P90_S2	The threshold estimate assumes $1,126 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P90_S3	The target estimate assumes $1,250 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P90_S4	The maximum estimate assumes $1,688 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P91_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2016-2018 performance cycle were equally allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P91_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings during the three-year performance cycle, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P92_S0	2016 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P92_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P92_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P92_S3	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P93_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P93_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P94_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2016 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P94_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are assumed to be 4.0% annually.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P94_S2	The discount assumption is 4.50%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2017 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.52%, 3.80%, and 4.79% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2016).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2015 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2015.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S3	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0%, a discount assumption of 4.65% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2016 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.34%, 4.03% and 5.06% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2015).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P95_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2015 were the same as those used for December 31, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P96_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P96_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P97_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P97_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer (except Mr. Doyle) was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S3	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014 will receive pay credits equal to 4% (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S4	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S5	For 2016, the limit was $265,000.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S6	For 2017, the limit is $270,000.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S7	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S8	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S9	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P98_S10	For 2016 and 2017, the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S4	This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P99_S7	As of December 31, 2016, all the Named Executive Officers were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P100_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P100_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P101_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P101_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P101_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P101_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P101_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P102_S0	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P102_S1	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P103_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P103_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P103_S2	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P103_S3	However, SERP participants as of December 31, 2012, who have not yet attained age 55, including Ms. Harris and Mr. Secrist, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P103_S4	All the participating Named Executive Officers are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P104_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a Named Executive Officer (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (i) below minus the sum of (ii) and (iii) below: i. One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P104_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P104_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P105_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P105_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P105_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P106_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P106_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P107_S0	The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P107_S1	The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P107_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2016 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S4	An executive may also elect to have his or her SERP benefit transferred to the Deferred Compensation Plan and paid in accordance with his or her elections under that plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S5	An executive may elect to have his or her SERP benefit paid, or commence to be paid, upon termination of employment after attaining age 55 but prior to attaining age 62.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S6	The SERP benefit of any executive who receives such early retirement benefits will be reduced by 1/3% for each month that the early commencement date precedes the beginning of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the executive attains age 62.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S7	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S8	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S9	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P108_S10	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P109_S0	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding aggregate executive and Company contributions and aggregate earnings for 2016 and year-end account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S0	_______________ The amount in this column reflects elective deferrals by the executive of salary, annual incentive compensation or LTI Plan awards paid in 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S1	Deferred salary amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $21,620; Mr. Secrist, $22,524; Ms. Mellies, $7,145; and Mr. Bussey, $0.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S2	Deferred incentive compensation amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $0; Mr. Secrist, $0; Ms. Mellies, $0; and Mr. Bussey, $0.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S3	Mr. Doyle deferred $228,875 of LTIP earnings.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S4	The amounts are also included in the applicable column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S5	The amount reported in this column reflects contributions by PSE consisting of the annual investment plan restoration amount and annual cash balance restoration amount described below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S6	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S7	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P110_S8	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2016.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P111_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P111_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P111_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P111_S3	The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P111_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P112_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P112_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P112_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P112_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P112_S4	The 2016 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P113_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P113_S1	Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P114_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P115_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P116_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P116_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P116_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P116_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P117_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P117_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P117_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P118_S0	Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) a change in control; (ii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iii) retirement; (iv) disability; or (v) death.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P119_S0	Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P119_S1	In addition, Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies are each parties to an Executive Employment Agreement with the Company, dated March 2009.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P119_S2	The agreements which provide for benefits or payments upon certain qualifying terminations of employment from the Company following a change in control.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P119_S3	The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, described below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P120_S0	Disability and Life Insurance Plans If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P120_S1	These disability and life insurance amounts are not reflected in the table below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P120_S2	The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P120_S3	The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65% of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P120_S4	The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P121_S0	LTI Plan Awards If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P121_S1	In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based on performance through the prior year.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P121_S2	In the event of a change in control in which awards are not assumed or substituted, outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid on a pro-rata basis at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change in control.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P122_S0	Employment Agreements with Certain Named Executive Officers In March 2009, PSE entered into Executive Employment Agreements (Employment Agreements) with each of Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies (the Covered Executives).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P122_S1	The Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P122_S2	In the event of a termination of employment within two years of a change in control (a Covered Termination), a Covered Executive is eligible to receive the payments described below.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P123_S0	A change in control generally means a person (or group of persons) (with certain exceptions set forth in the Employment Agreements) acquires (i) beneficial ownership of more than 55% of the total combined voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately after such acquisition (other than through a registered public offering) or (ii) all or substantially all of the Company s assets.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P124_S0	Payments upon Involuntary Termination without Cause or for Good Reason If a Covered Executive s employment is terminated without cause by the Company or is terminated by the Covered Executive for good reason within two years of a change in control, the Covered Executive is eligible to receive the following compensation and benefits:
1085392_17_ITEM11_P125_S0	Pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs (Annual Bonus).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P126_S0	Continued group medical, dental, disability and life insurance benefits to the Covered Executive and his or her family for the remainder of the two-year protection period.
1085392_17_ITEM11_P126_S1	Benefits will be paid by the Company while the Covered Executive is eligible for COBRA and thereafter by reimbursement of payments made by the Covered Executive for such coverage (including related tax amounts), except that if the Covered Executive becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits under the Employment Agreement will become secondary to those provided by the other employer (the foregoing benefit is referred to as Health and Welfare Benefit Continuation).
1085392_17_ITEM11_P127_S0	Under the Employment Agreements, cause and good reason have the following meanings:

1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S0	corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S1	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (i) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (ii) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (iii) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (iv) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S2	The Company s definition of "Independent Director" is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S3	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S4	The Boards have also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.

1085392_17_ITEM13_P14_S6	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P15_S0	Mr. Hooper and Mr. Armstrong, Ms. McWilliams and Ms. Dressel serve as directors or officers of, or otherwise have a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P15_S1	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P15_S2	Because these relationships either fall within the Boards' categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_17_ITEM13_P16_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.

1085392_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult.

1085392_18_ITEM1_P5_S2	While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P5_S3	PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P5_S4	While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	The following tables present PSE's capital expenditures for the five-year period ended December 31, 2017 and gross utility plant by category and percentages as of December 31, 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	Employees At December 31, 2017 , PSE had approximately 3,140 full-time equivalent employees.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	Approximately 1,110 PSE employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union (IBEW) or the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P8_S2	The contracts with the IBEW and the UA were both ratified effective December 2017 and will expire March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	Puget Energy does not have any employees.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	PSE's employees provide employment services to Puget Energy and charges for their related salaries and benefits at cost.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	Segment Information Puget Energy and PSE operate one reportable business segment, referred to as the regulated utility segment.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	For more information on this segment, see Note 17, "Segment Information" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	Corporate Location PSE s and Puget Energy's principal executive offices are located at 10885 NE 4 th Street, Suite 1200, Bellevue, Washington 98004 and the telephone number is (425) 454-6363.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under Additional Information in Part III Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance".
1085392_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	Regulation and Rates PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE s operating territory.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous twelve-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward looking twelve-month period.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	Both allow recovery of expenditures without the lengthy process of a full GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	General Rate Case Filing On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission, the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	Since July 2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	This monthly adjustment mitigates the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	The energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	Total electric and natural gas revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S5	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P16_S6	For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Electric Rate Filings Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	The power cost baseline is set in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the $30.0 million cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P19_S1	The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:
1085392_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P21_S3	Rates change annually on January 1.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	Power Cost Only Rate Case A power cost rate case is a limited-scope proceeding to reset power cost rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	Rates change bi-annually on October 1.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	The purpose of the CRM is to recover capital costs related to projects included in PSE's pipe replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Rates change annually on November 1.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	Purchased Gas Adjustment PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P26_S1	PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P26_S2	A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P26_S3	Rates change annually on November 1.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P27_S3	The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and adjustments to the rate from the prior year.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	Natural Gas Conservation Rider The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual versus forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	For additional information on electric and natural gas rates, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 7 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	_______________ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	Average megawatt (aMW) usage by customers divided by their maximum usage.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Electric Supply At December 31, 2017 , PSE s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,737 megawatts (MW).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	PSE s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P34_S1	When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P34_S2	The following table shows PSE s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 :
1085392_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	Company Owned Electric Generation Resources At December 31, 2017 , PSE owns the following plants with an aggregate net generating capacity of 3,614 MW:
1085392_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	_______________ Net Maximum Capacity is the capacity a unit can sustain over a specified period of time when not restricted by ambient conditions or deratings, less the losses associated with auxiliary loads.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P36_S1	The FERC license authorizes the full 54.4 MW; however, the project's water right issued by the State Department of Ecology limits flow to 2,500 cubic feet and therefore output to 47.7MW.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts During 2017 , approximately 13.3% of PSE s energy supply requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P37_S1	PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P37_S2	PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P37_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs projects as set forth below:
1085392_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	PSE had seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for 44 aMW of capacity which expired on July 1, 2017 with no provision to renew this agreement.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	PSE will procure more capacity from Mid-Columbia to recover for this loss of capacity, if needed.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P39_S2	PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas Electric Company for 300 MW of capacity which currently has no set expiration.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	PSE has committed 600 MW of existing BPA transmission solely for the EIM market.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately $10.0 million, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	The calculated benefits represent the cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S4	Benefits can take the form of cost savings or profits or their combination.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P40_S5	Benefits include greenhouse gas (GHG) revenue, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE s system.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S2	Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S3	PSE s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S4	Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE s load is available for sale to third parties.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S5	PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S6	In 2017 , PSE had 4,646 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S7	Additionally, PSE contracted with BPA for an additional 53 MW of transmission demand that went into effect from May to November of 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P41_S8	PSE s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	of PSE s natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	During 2017 , PSE purchased approximately 69.9 % of its natural gas in British Columbia, 21.8 % in Alberta and 8.3 % in the United States.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P44_S1	The 2017 IRP was filed on November 14, 2017 and identified the following capacity shortfalls and surpluses:
1085392_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2017 IRP.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P45_S1	PSE projects that beginning in 2022 its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio because of the retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 2, approximately 307 MW of capacity.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P45_S2	Therefore, PSE s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources and additional capacity resources such as battery storage and generation plants that operate during peak loads.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale market.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	These purchases are subject to the sharing bands of the PCA mechanism, at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	_______________ Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P48_S1	PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	All of PSE s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE s service territory.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S1	Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S2	Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE s natural gas system.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S3	Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S4	PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S5	PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S6	During 2017 , PSE purchased approximately 54.8 % of its natural gas for its natural gas customers in British Columbia, 19.1 % in Alberta and 26.1 % in the United States.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S7	PSE s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S8	The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P51_S9	Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	Natural Gas Storage Capacity PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP s pipeline to serve PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S2	Combined with capacity contracted from NWP s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S3	Of this total, PSE holds 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S4	The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S5	Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 640,600 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P52_S6	In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of two and three years and has rights to extend such agreements.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P53_S2	PSE has temporarily released a portion of its Clay Basin storage services to third parties, and its net storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin is 8.9 million Dth and over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P54_S0	LNG and Propane-Air Resources LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P54_S1	Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P55_S0	During 2014, PSE, working with NWP determined that the pipeline redelivery service to PSE from NWP s Plymouth LNG facility could no longer be considered firm during peak conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P55_S1	As a result, PSE terminated the service agreement effective October 31, 2015 and removed the resource from its natural gas firm portfolio.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P56_S0	natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P56_S1	PSE will use the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P56_S2	In addition, PSE acquired 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for the generation fleet.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P56_S3	The balance of the LNG capacity will be delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE s generation fleet.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P57_S0	PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P57_S1	This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE s distribution system; however, it is temporarily not in-service pending planned environmental, safety, efficiency and reliability upgrades.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P58_S0	PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P59_S0	Tacoma LNG Facility Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the Tacoma LNG facility is expected to be operational in 2019.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P59_S1	On January 24, 2018, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency s determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement is necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P59_S2	As a result of requiring a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, the Company's construction schedule may be impacted depending on the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency's timing and decision on the air quality permit.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P59_S3	If delayed, the construction schedule and costs may be adversely impacted.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Tacoma LNG facility will provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and will provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P60_S1	Pursuant to the Washington Commission s order, PSE will be allocated 43.0% of the capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility and Puget LNG will be allocated the remaining 57.0% of the capital and operating costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P60_S2	The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P61_S0	Natural Gas Transportation Capacity PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P61_S1	GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P62_S0	PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P62_S1	PSE holds approximately 542,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE s service territory.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P62_S2	In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers.

1085392_18_ITEM1_P63_S4	PSE s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of six years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P63_S5	PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to six years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P64_S0	Capacity Release The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P64_S1	Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P64_S2	The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P64_S3	PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P65_S0	Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S0	Energy Efficiency PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S1	PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S2	PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S3	PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S4	However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P66_S5	To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P67_S0	Environment PSE s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P67_S1	See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P68_S0	Air and Climate Change Protection PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P68_S1	All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P68_S2	This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P68_S3	PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P69_S0	These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P69_S1	The Colstrip plant represents PSE s most significant source of GHG emissions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P70_S0	Species Protection PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P71_S0	A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P71_S1	Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P71_S2	Designations of protected species under these laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P72_S0	Remediation PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P72_S1	These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P73_S0	The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P73_S1	PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P73_S2	These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P74_S0	Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P74_S1	These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P75_S0	Water Protection PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P76_S0	with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P77_S0	Mercury Emissions Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P77_S1	Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P78_S0	The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P78_S1	Generating units were given three years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P78_S2	Colstrip met the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases as of April 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P79_S0	Siting New Facilities In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P79_S1	These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P80_S0	Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P80_S1	PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P80_S2	Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE s operations and costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P81_S0	Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P81_S1	PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P81_S2	As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P81_S3	PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P82_S0	PSE has considered the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S0	PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S1	Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S2	Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S3	Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S4	The most recent data indicate that PSE s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2016 were 10.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P83_S5	Approximately 43.0% of PSE s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.6 million metric tons) are associated with PSE s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P84_S0	PSE s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S0	Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules On August 3, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S1	The rule was published on October 23, 2015, and separates standards for new power plants fueled by natural gas and coal.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S2	New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S3	of CO 2 /megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S4	New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P85_S5	of CO 2 /MWh, which is less stringent than the draft rule.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P86_S0	The standard for coal plants would not specifically require Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) but CCS was reaffirmed by the EPA as the best system of emission reductions (BSER).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P86_S1	These 111(b) standards are implemented by the states, but states have limited flexibility to alter the standards set by the EPA.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P87_S0	The EPA announced the final rule for 111(d), the Clean Power Plan rule, on August 3, 2015 and published it on October 23, 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P87_S1	On October 10, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal this rule and will accept comments until April 26, 2018.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P87_S2	As such, PSE is monitoring the situation and awaiting the final determination by the EPA.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P88_S0	Washington Clean Air Rule The Clean Air Rule (CAR) was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities located within Washington State.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P88_S1	Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P89_S0	CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5.0% every three years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P89_S1	Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P90_S0	CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P90_S1	CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S0	On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging CAR.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S1	On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to CAR in Thurston County Superior Court.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S2	On December 15, 2017, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S3	A final court order is pending and in the meantime, the Washington State Department of Ecology, submitted a brief requesting severability, which would make the rule valid for industries with direct emissions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S4	This would apply to the Company's electric utility thermal generation units but not to its natural gas utility.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P91_S5	Appeals could be filed to the Thurston County Court of Appeals after the court's final order, including its ruling on severability.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P92_S0	Regional Haze Rule On January 10, 2017, the EPA provided revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which were published in the Federal Register.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P92_S1	Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021; however, the end date will remain 2028.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P92_S2	Aspects of these revisions are currently being challenged by various entities nationwide and briefing has not yet been scheduled.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P92_S3	In the meantime, the state of Montana has indicated plans to work on and submit a State Implementation Plan for the second planning period.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P93_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR's) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P93_S1	The EPA issued another rule, effective October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines under the CCR rule.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P94_S0	The CCR rule is self-implementing at a federal level or can be taken over by a state.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P95_S0	The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P95_S1	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P95_S2	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P96_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P96_S1	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO).
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S0	In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S1	The EPA is using this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S2	The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015 but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S3	It was anticipated that the rule would be published in November 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S4	However on January 30, 2017 the Trump Administration published the Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs directive which placed the rulemaking on indefinite hold.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P97_S5	At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P98_S0	The executive officers of Puget Energy as of March 1, 2018 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P99_S0	Officers of Puget Energy are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P100_S0	The executive officers of PSE as of March 1, 2018 are listed below along with their business experience during the past five years.
1085392_18_ITEM1_P101_S0	Officers of PSE are elected for one-year terms.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE s business operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy s and PSE s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	RISKS RELATING TO PSE s REGULATORY AND RATE-MAKING PROCEDURES PSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	PSE's regulatory risks include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE s earnings, liquidity and business activities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services is the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S2	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P3_S3	PSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or decreasing rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	PSE s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Power costs on the other hand, are normalized for market, weather and hydrological conditions projected to occur during the applicable rate year, the ensuing twelve-month period after rates become effective.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its natural gas customers based on historic costs during a particular test year.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	If in a specific year PSE s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P8_S3	For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	PSE is currently subject to a Washington Commission order that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The Washington Commission previously approved an electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system costs, along with an ERF, a rate plan and an earnings sharing mechanism that requires PSE and its customers to share in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.77% during the term of the rate plan.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the threshold, even if the other service did not meet the earnings test.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The settlement agreement accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and effective December 19, 2017 provided for an updated rate of return of 7.60%.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P11_S2	As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE s expenses could significantly increase.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	PSE s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The utility business involves many operating risks.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	If PSE s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	PSE s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, and wind-powered generating facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including:
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	If PSE is unable to protect its physical assets from terrorist attacks or its information technology infrastructure and network against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, its operations could be disrupted.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	Despite PSE's implementation of security measures, its physical assets and technology systems may be vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and PSE were unable to recover in a timely manner, PSE may be unable to fulfill critical business functions and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, these physical asset or cyber-based attacks could disrupt its ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products and could affect the reliability or operability of the electric and natural gas systems.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	As a result, PSE endeavors to maintain vigilant security programs and procedures to protect against the continuous threat of physical asset and cyber-based attacks, and as a result, PSE may be required to expend significant dollars and other resources to protect against existing and ensuing threats.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	PSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	In that event, PSE s financial results could be adversely affected.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Costs of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE s results of operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	PSE s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To fulfill these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, mitigation measures, pollution control equipment and emissions related abatement and fees.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S2	New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE s operations may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE and adversely affect PSE s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P21_S4	In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates, in a timely manner, at current levels in the future.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Under current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P22_S1	The incurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE s results of operations and financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including an emission performance standard provision and the EPA set CO 2 emission standards with specific state goals.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	PSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	PSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and natural gas infrastructure system.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE s customers and also require significant expenditures by PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	PSE depends on an aging work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to an aging workforce, loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S2	PSE s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE s ability to employ and retain skilled professional and technical workers.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S3	Without a skilled workforce, PSE s ability to provide quality service to PSE s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE s earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P27_S4	Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	PSE continues to be concerned about the availability and aging of skilled workers for special complex utility functions.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S1	PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and natural gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE s natural gas and electric service and accordingly PSE s results of operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Potential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	When a town or city in PSE's service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility, it acquires PSE's assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that PSE provides.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Although PSE is compensated in connection with the town or city's acquisition of its assets, any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Technological developments may have an adverse impact on PSE's financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial ratios, may increase Puget Energy's and PSE s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	The amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of October 25, 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	There was $102.6 million outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Puget Energy's credit facility includes an expansion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion .
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	a separate credit facility, which provides PSE with access to $800.0 million in short-term borrowing capability, and includes an expansion feature that could, upon the banks' approval, increase the size of the facility to $1.4 billion .
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	The PSE credit facility matures on October 25, 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facility.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In addition, Puget Energy has issued $1.8 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2017 , had approximately $3.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds, senior notes and junior subordinated notes.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	A downgrade in Puget Energy s or PSE s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S1	Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S2	For example, under Puget Energy s and PSE s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S3	A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Any downgrade below investment grade of PSE s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P40_S5	PSE may not declare or make any dividend distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The Company s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing audits related to these taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017 introduced significant permanent and temporary changes to the federal tax code.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	These changes include a tax rate change from 35.0% to 21.0%, the exclusion of utility businesses from claiming bonus depreciation, the limitation of interest deductibility by non-utility businesses, in addition to numerous other changes.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The final interpretation and regulatory treatment of the tax reform changes is uncertain.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Poor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE s funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P46_S3	Any contributions to PSE s plans in 2018 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could impact PSE s cash flow and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Potential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company s costs, reduce the Company s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management s attention and resources.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Puget Energy's ability to pay dividends may be limited.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S2	PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S4	If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S5	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S6	In addition, beginning February 6, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0% or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S7	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its' corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P50_S8	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.0% at December 31, 2017 and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.5 to 1.0 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Challenges relating to the construction or future operation of the Tacoma LNG facility could adversely affect the Company s operations.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	PSE and Puget Energy s subsidiary, Puget LNG, currently are constructing the Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma, a jointly owned facility intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers, and to provide LNG as fuel primarily to the maritime market.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility s expected output to other potential customers.
1085392_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Scheduled to be completed in 2019, delays in the facility s construction and operation or in its ability to timely deliver fuel to customers could expose Puget LNG to damages under one or more fuel supply contracts, which could unfavorably impact Puget Energy s return on investment.
1085392_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	The principal electric generating plants and underground natural gas storage facilities owned by PSE are described under Item 1, Business Electric Supply and Natural Gas Supply.
1085392_18_ITEM2_P1_S0	PSE owns its transmission and distribution facilities and various other properties.
1085392_18_ITEM2_P1_S1	Substantially all properties of PSE are subject to the liens of PSE s mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM2_P2_S0	The Company s corporate headquarters is housed in a leased building located in Bellevue, Washington.
1085392_18_ITEM3_P0_S0	For information on litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings, see Item 1, "Business, Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation" and Note 14, "Litigation" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P0_S0	All of the outstanding shares of Puget Energy s common stock, the only class of common equity of Puget Energy, are held by its direct parent Puget Equico LLC (Puget Equico), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Puget Holdings, and are not publicly traded.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P0_S1	The outstanding shares of PSE s common stock, the only class of common equity of PSE, are held by Puget Energy and are not publicly traded.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P0_S2	The payment of dividends on PSE common stock to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s mortgage indentures in addition to terms of the Washington Commission merger order.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P0_S3	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission as well as by the terms of its credit facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P0_S4	For further discussion, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors"- Risks Relating to Puget Energy s Corporate Structure and Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this report.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P1_S0	From time to time, when deemed advisable and permitted, PSE and Puget Energy pay dividends on its common stock.
1085392_18_ITEM5_P1_S1	During 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , PSE paid dividends to its parent, Puget Energy, and Puget Energy paid dividends to its parent, Puget Equico, in the amounts shown in Puget Energy's and PSE's Consolidated Statements of Common Shareholder's Equity, included in this Form 10-K.
1085392_18_ITEM6_P0_S0	The following tables show selected financial data.
1085392_18_ITEM6_P0_S1	This information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes found in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" along with the information included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" of this Form 10-K.

1085392_18_ITEM7_P1_S7	Except as required by law, neither Puget Energy nor PSE undertakes an obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P1_S8	Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy s and PSE s other reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy s and PSE s business, prospects and results of operations.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P2_S0	Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P2_S1	PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P2_S2	Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P3_S0	Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P3_S1	Puget LNG was formed on November 29, 2016, and has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P4_S0	All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings, LLC (Puget Holdings).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P4_S1	Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including Macquarie Infrastructure Partners, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P4_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P5_S0	PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P5_S1	PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P5_S2	The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P5_S3	PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P5_S4	Factors affecting PSE's performance are set forth in this Overview section, as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P6_S0	Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as well as return on equity (ROE) excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments (net income plus unrealized losses and/or minus unrealized gains on derivative instruments divided by average common equity) that is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P6_S1	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P6_S2	The Company believes that return on average of monthly averages (AMA) equity, also a non-GAAP measure, is a more suitable metric for comparing ROE across years and is a more accurate metric for assessing and evaluating ROE performance against the Company's authorized regulated ROE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P6_S3	The AMA equity is not intended to represent the regulated equity.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P7_S0	PSE's ROE may not be comparable to other companies' ROE measures.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P7_S1	Furthermore, this measure is not intended to replace ROE (GAAP net income divided by GAAP average common equity) as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P8_S0	The following table presents PSE s ROE, its return on AMA equity and its authorized regulated ROE for 2017 and 2016 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P9_S0	_______________ Equity adjustments are related to removing the impacts of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), subsidiary retained earnings, retained earnings of derivative instruments, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P9_S1	The authorized regulated return on equity rate changed to 9.5% effective December 19, 2017, per the approved GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Company s 2017 return on AMA equity was 9.0% , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P11_S0	Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $478.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P11_S1	The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P11_S2	The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.2%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P12_S0	Rates are based on an assumption of normal weather.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P12_S1	The amount of variance due to weather was $13.2 million, which resulted in an impact on ROE of positive 0.3%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P13_S0	Depreciation expense was $24.8 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 for an impact on ROE of negative 0.7%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P14_S0	Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities and interest savings which totaled $28.2 million for an impact on ROE of positive 0.7%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P15_S0	The Company s 2016 return on AMA equity was 8.9% , which is lower than the authorized regulated ROE primarily due to the following:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P16_S0	Regulated equity (rate base time's equity percent) was $360.0 million lower than AMA equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P16_S1	The variance was primarily driven by the impact on rate base of the deferred tax liability for utility, plant and equipment.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P16_S2	The impact on ROE for this variance was negative 1.0%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P17_S0	Depreciation expense was $10.5 million higher than the amount allowed in rates for the year ended December 31, 2016 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P18_S0	Partially offsetting the above was net revenue from below the line activities which totaled $4.3 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P19_S0	Factors and Trends Affecting PSE s Performance PSE s ongoing regulatory requirements and operational needs necessitated the investment of substantial capital in 2017 and will continue to do so in future years.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P19_S1	Because PSE intends to seek recovery of such investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P19_S2	The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE s operations and financial performance include:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P20_S0	Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P20_S1	PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P20_S2	The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P21_S0	Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P21_S1	In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P21_S2	If the Washington Commission determines that an operating expense or capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such operating expense or capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S0	During 2013, PSE completed an expedited rate filing (ERF), which was a limited scope rate proceeding, and established a decoupling mechanism for natural gas operations and electric transmission, distribution and administrative costs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S1	The ERF proceeding established baseline rates on which the decoupling mechanism will operate during the rate plan period.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S2	The ERF also established a property tax tracker mechanism in which any difference between amounts in rates and property tax payments will be deferred and recovered in an annual filing based on the actual cash payments for the year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S3	The decoupling mechanism allows PSE to recover delivery costs on a per customer basis rather than on a consumption basis.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S4	Included in the decoupling petition was a rate plan that allows PSE an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return without the need for another GRC process during the rate plan period.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S5	The rate plan included predetermined annual increases to PSE s allowed electric and natural gas revenue.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S6	This plan required PSE to file a GRC no later than April 1, 2016, which was later extended to January 17, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P22_S7	The GRC was filed with the Washington Commission on January 13, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P23_S0	Washington state law also requires PSE to pursue electric conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P23_S1	PSE s mandate to pursue electric conservation initiatives may have a negative impact on the electric business financial performance due to lost margins from lower sales volumes as variable power costs are not part of the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P24_S0	Although not specified by Washington state law, the Washington Commission also sets natural gas conservation achievement standards for PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P24_S1	The effects of achieving these standards will, however, have only a slight negative impact on natural gas business financial performance due to the natural gas business being almost fully decoupled.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S0	In 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S1	Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital to 7.77% which updated long-term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8% .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S2	This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE will share 50.0% of any earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return with customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S3	In addition, the K-Factor (rate plan) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% per year for electric customers and 2.2% per year for natural gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the effective date of new rates in PSE's General Rate Case (GRC).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S4	The new rates became effective December 19, 2017, as discussed below.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P25_S5	In the decoupling mechanism, increases were subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P26_S0	General Rate Case Filing On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P26_S1	For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S0	Decoupling Filings On December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S1	Electric and natural gas delivery revenues will continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs will now be decoupled and recovered on a fixed monthly amount basis.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S2	The allowed decoupling revenue will no longer increase annually on January 1 for electric and natural gas customers and these amounts can only be changed in a GRC, Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC) or ERF filing.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S3	Other changes include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S4	The rate cap which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S5	The decoupling mechanism will end on the effective date of PSE's first GRC filed in or after 2021, or in a separate proceeding if appropriate unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in either of those proceedings.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P27_S6	PSE s decoupling mechanism over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P28_S0	The Washington Commission approved the following PSE requests to change rates under its electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P29_S0	As noted earlier, at the time of the filings below, the Company was also limited to a 3.0% annual decoupling related cap on increases in total revenue.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P29_S1	This limitation has been triggered as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	Existing deferrals may be included in customer rates beginning in May 2018, subject to subsequent application of the earnings test and the cap on decoupling related rate increases for natural gas customers, which was changed from 3.0% to 5.0% as a result of the Washington Commission order in PSE's GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	Electric Rates Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the power cost baseline level of power costs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P31_S1	The power cost baseline levels are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P31_S2	Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P31_S3	The graduated scale that was applicable through December 31, 2016 was as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P32_S0	On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the changes to the PCA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P32_S1	The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P33_S0	The PCA settlement also resulted in the following changes to the PCA mechanism:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P34_S0	Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P34_S1	Inclusion of these costs in the decoupling mechanism was subsequently approved in the GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P35_S0	Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P36_S0	On September 30, 2016, PSE filed an accounting petition with the Washington Commission, which requested deferral of the variances, either positive or negative, between the fixed costs previously recovered in the PCA and the revenue received to cover the allowed fixed costs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P36_S1	The deferral period requested was January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, when rates went into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S0	On November 10, 2016, the Washington Commission issued Order No. 01 approving PSE s accounting petition.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S1	With the final determination in PSE s GRC, this deferral ceased with the rate effective date of December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2017 , in its PCA mechanism, PSE under recovered its power costs by $11.5 million of which no amount was apportioned to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S3	This compares to an under recovery of power costs of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 of which no amounts were apportioned to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S4	Although load increased in 2017 compared to 2016, that increase was offset by a decrease in the total baseline rate and an increase in costs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S5	Additionally, the year over year variance was due to the 2017 mechanism changes where fixed production costs, other costs and adjustments are no longer included.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S6	The mechanism is now comparing variable PCA costs using the variable costs portion of the baseline rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S7	The fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism, effective December 19, 2017 as a result of the GRC but until then the revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs are being deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P37_S8	The revenue variance associated with the fixed production costs was deferred using the fixed cost portion of the baseline rate until December 19, 2017, when the fixed costs became part of the decoupling mechanism with the resolution of PSE s GRC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P38_S0	The following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P39_S0	Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff The following table sets forth Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P40_S0	The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE will be receiving from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) between October 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P40_S1	Rates change bi-annually on October 1.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P40_S2	The following table sets forth residential exchange benefit adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding expected annual impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P41_S0	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P42_S0	The following table sets forth CRM rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P43_S0	The following table sets forth PGA rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P44_S0	The following table sets forth property tax tracker mechanism rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P45_S0	The following table sets forth conservation rider rate adjustments approved by the Washington Commission and the corresponding annual impact on PSE s revenue based on the effective dates:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S0	Other Proceedings Large Customer Retail Wheeling On October 7, 2016, PSE filed a tariff to provide open access service to a narrow set of qualifying customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S1	Subsequent to that tariff filing, parties to the case reached an all-party settlement that converted the tariff to a special contract only allowing retail access for the loads of the Microsoft Corporation currently being served under PSE s electric Schedule 40.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S2	The special contract includes the following conditions: (i) Microsoft exceed Washington State s current renewable portfolio standards, (ii) the remainder of power sold to it be carbon free, (iii) there be no reduction in its funding of PSE s conservation programs, (iv) an exit fee be paid that will be a straight pass-through to customers and (v) Microsoft fund enhanced low-income support.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S3	A definitive agreement among the parties, the special contract and supportive testimony were filed with the Washington Commission on April 11, 2017 with hearings that occurred on May 3, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S4	The Washington Commission issued an order on July 13, 2017 approving PSE s special contract with Microsoft.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S5	Microsoft cannot begin taking service under the special contract until it has the required metering installed, has contracts for the supply and transmission of its power supply and pays the exit fee.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P46_S6	PSE currently anticipates these conditions will be met in early 2019.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P47_S0	On September 28, 2016, the Washington Commission approved PSE's tariff revision to create an additional voluntary renewable energy product, effective September 30, 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P47_S1	This provides customers with energy choices to help them meet their sustainability goals.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P47_S2	Incremental costs of the program will be allocated to the voluntary participants of the program as is the case with PSE s existing Green Power programs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P48_S0	PSE initially offered this service, Green Direct, to larger customers (aggregated annual loads greater than 10,000,000 kWh) and government customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P48_S1	Approximately 136.8 MW of new wind generation facilities will be constructed in the region by a developer under contract to PSE to meet the demand for this voluntary renewable energy product project.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P48_S2	PSE anticipates that customers will start receiving energy through this program in 2019.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P49_S0	For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P50_S0	Access to Debt Capital PSE relies on access to bank borrowings and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term capital markets to fund its utility construction program, to meet maturing debt obligations and other capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by cash flow from its operations or equity investment from its parent, Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P50_S1	Neither Puget Energy nor PSE have any debt outstanding whose maturity would accelerate upon a credit rating downgrade.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P50_S2	However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the Company's ability to renew existing, or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P50_S3	For example, under Puget Energy's and PSE's credit facilities, the borrowing costs increase as their respective credit ratings decline due to increases in credit spreads and commitment fees.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P50_S4	If PSE is unable to access debt capital on reasonable terms, its ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be relied on for future growth and to otherwise implement its strategy, could be adversely affected.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P51_S0	PSE monitors the credit environment and expects to continue to be able to access the capital markets to meet its short-term and long-term borrowing needs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P51_S1	In October 2017, PSE and Puget Energy each entered into new 5-year credit facilities that replaced the previous facilities and are scheduled to mature in October 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P51_S2	For additional information on credit facilities, see Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements" included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P52_S0	Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P52_S1	These regulations cover electric system reliability, natural gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P52_S2	Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P52_S3	PSE must spend a significant amount of resources to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P52_S4	Compliance with these or other future regulations, such as those pertaining to climate change, could require significant capital expenditures by PSE and may adversely affect PSE's financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P53_S0	Other Challenges and Strategies Competition PSE s electric and natural gas utility retail customers generally do not have the ability to choose their electric or natural gas supplier; and therefore, PSE s business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P53_S1	However, PSE faces competition from public utility districts and municipalities that want to establish their own municipal-owned utility, as a result of which PSE may lose a number of customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P53_S2	Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P53_S3	Alternative methods of electric energy generation, including solar and other self-generation methods, compete with PSE for sales to existing electric retail customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P53_S4	In addition, PSE s natural gas customers may elect to use heating oil, propane or other fuels instead of using and purchasing natural gas from PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P54_S0	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P54_S1	The following discussion provides the significant items that impacted PSE s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P55_S0	The following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as two other financial measures, electric margin and natural gas margin, that are considered non-GAAP financial measures.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P56_S0	Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance, financial position or cash flows that includes adjustments that result in a departure from GAAP presentation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P57_S0	The presentation of electric margin and natural gas margin is intended to supplement an understanding of PSE s operating performance.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P57_S1	Electric margin and natural gas margin are used by PSE to determine whether PSE is collecting the appropriate amount of revenue from its customers to maintain electric and natural gas margins to ultimately provide adequate recovery of operating costs, including interest and equity returns.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P57_S2	PSE s electric margin and natural gas margin measures may not be comparable to other companies electric margin and natural gas margin measures.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P57_S3	Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P58_S0	Electric Margin Electric margin represents electric sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers, including transmission costs to bring electric energy to PSE s service territory.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P59_S0	The following chart displays the changes in PSE s electric margin from 2016 to 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P60_S0	_______________ * Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P61_S0	2016 compared to 2017 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $182.2 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $112.5 million , increased transportation and other revenue of $92.5 million , partially offset by decreased decoupling revenue of $20.0 million and other decoupling revenue of $6.5 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P61_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P62_S0	Electric retail sales increased $112.5 million due an increase of $100.0 million from additional retail electricity usage of 4.2% compared to the prior year and an increase in rates of $12.5 million due to the decoupling rate mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P62_S1	The additional usage was due to an increase of residential and commercial use per customer of 6.7% and 2.2%, respectively, an increase in heating degree days of 19.9% compared to 2016, and an increase in retail customers of 1.4%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P63_S0	Decoupling revenue decreased $20.0 million due to a decrease in decoupling deferrals of $23.5 million driven by actual revenue being closer to PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P63_S1	The increase in actual revenue was due to an increase in load as discussed above in electric retail sales.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P63_S2	This was partially offset by an increase in decoupling revenue of $3.5 million due to fixed production cost deferrals, which were removed from the PCA mechanism and placed into the decoupling mechanism effective January 1, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P64_S0	Other decoupling revenue decreased $6.5 million due to an increase in decoupling collections of $9.5 million due to an increase in rates in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P64_S1	In 2016, there was $1.3 million of decoupling deferred revenue that could not be collected within 24 months compared to no reserve in the current year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P65_S0	The decoupling collection and refund of rate of return (ROR) excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P66_S0	Transportation and other revenue increased $92.5 million primarily due to a change in production tax credit (PTC) deferral revenue of $73.2 million due to a $19.9 million reduction to revenue in 2016 as PTCs were generated compared to no PTC generated in 2017, as well as, a $51.2 million remeasurement of the PTC deferral in 2017 due to tax law change.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P66_S1	Additionally, there was an increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $17.5 million due to increased purchased electricity, as discussed below.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P67_S0	Electric Power Costs Electric power costs increased $43.2 million primarily due to an increase of $58.4 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $9.1 million of electric generation fuel expense and an increase of $6.1 million of residential exchange credits.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P67_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P68_S0	Purchased electricity expense increased $58.4 million primarily due to an 11.2% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in prices.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P68_S1	The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P68_S2	Additionally, a decrease of hydro and wind production of 7.4% and 14.7%, increased the need to purchase additional wholesale power.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P69_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $9.1 million primarily due to a $2.7 million reduction in combustion turbine generation costs as a result of a 7.9% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and a $6.3 million decrease in coal generation costs primarily at Colstrip units 3 and 4 for variable fuel costs due to less coal delivered and burned in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	Residential exchange credits increased $6.1 million resulting from higher Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement due to the REP credit tariff increase in 2017 and increased usage.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P72_S1	The program is administered by BPA.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P72_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	The following chart displays the changes in PSE s electric margin from 2015 to 2016 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	_______________ * Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	2015 compared to 2016 Electric Operating Revenue Electric operating revenues increased $110.0 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $81.1 million, increased decoupling revenue of $16.3 million and transportation and other revenue of $13.6 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Electric retail sales increased $81.1 million due to increases in rates of $86.4 million primarily from the reduction of the residential exchange credits and an increase in the decoupling rate mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	The increase from rates was partially offset by $5.6 million due to a 0.3% reduction in retail electricity usage.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P76_S2	The reduction in usage was due to a decrease of residential, commercial and industrial average use per customer of 0.6%, 2.7% and 2.5%, respectively, as a result of energy efficiency.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	The reduction in use per customer were offset by an increase in retail customers of 1.5% and an increase in heating degree days of 0.6% compared to 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P77_S0	Decoupling revenue increased $16.3 million due to actual revenues were lower than PSE's allowed revenue per the decoupling mechanism compared to 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P77_S1	This increase was primarily from residential and commercial decoupled rate schedules, which increased $15.6 million in 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P77_S2	The increase was driven from an increase in customers which increases the allowed revenue and a decrease in use per customer, which lowers the actual revenue resulting in higher decoupled revenue.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P78_S0	Other decoupling revenue decreased $4.5 million due to an increase of $16.8 million of decoupling collections as compared to 2015 from an increase in rates in 2016; partially offset by a decrease in the ROR excess earnings sharing of $13.5 million from a reduction in the ROR excess earnings accrual of $6.5 million compared to 2015 and an increase of $7.0 million in refunds to customers for the 2015 ROR excess earnings set into customer rates in 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	The decoupling collection and refund of ROR excess earnings are driven by the tariff rates and retail sales.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Transportation and other revenue increased $13.6 million primarily due to a reduction of amortization of PTC deferral credits of $10.1 million since PTC generation at Hopkins Ridge ended in 2015 and increase in net wholesale natural gas sales of $6.8 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	Electric Power Costs Electric power costs increased $40.1 million primarily due to a decrease of $42.6 million of residential exchange credit, an increase of $32.1 million of purchased electricity costs, partially offset by a decrease of $34.6 million of electric generation fuel expense.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	These items are discussed in detail below:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P82_S0	Purchased electricity expense increased $32.1 million primarily due to a 16.1% increase in wholesale electricity purchases, partially offset by a 8.3% decrease in wholesale electricity prices.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P82_S1	The increase in purchases was primarily driven by an increase in load and lower wholesale electricity prices on the open market compared to generating power.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P82_S2	Additionally, an increase of hydro and wind production of 32.2% and 14.4% decreased the need to purchase additional wholesale power due to favorable conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P83_S0	Electric generation fuel expense decreased $34.6 million primarily due to a $43.0 million reduction in combustion turbine costs as a result of a 28.8% reduction in combustion turbine generation due to favorable wholesale electricity prices and increased wind and hydro generation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P83_S1	This was partially offset by an $8.4 million increase in coal generation costs primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of coal.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P84_S0	Residential exchange credits decreased $42.6 million resulting from lower Residential Exchange Program (REP) credits associated with the BPA REP settlement.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P84_S1	The REP credit tariff was lowered effective October 1, 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P85_S0	The REP credit is a pass-through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue, with no impact on net income.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P86_S0	The Northwest Power Act, through the REP, provides access to the benefits of low-cost federal power for residential and small farm customers of regional utilities, including PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P86_S1	The program is administered by BPA.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P86_S2	Pursuant to agreements (including settlement agreements) between BPA and PSE, BPA has provided payments of REP benefits to PSE, which PSE has passed through to its residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P87_S0	Natural Gas Margin Natural gas margin is natural gas sales to retail and transportation customers less the cost of natural gas purchased, including transportation costs to bring natural gas to PSE s service territory.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P87_S1	The PGA mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the natural gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in natural gas pipeline transportation costs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P87_S2	PSE's margin or net income is not affected by changes under the PGA mechanism because over and under recoveries of natural gas costs included in baseline PGA rates are deferred and either refunded or collected from customers, respectively, in future periods.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P87_S3	The following chart displays the changes in PSE s natural gas margin from 2016 to 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P88_S0	* Includes decoupling cash collections, rate of return excess earnings, and decoupling 24-month revenue reserve.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P89_S0	2016 compared to 2017 Natural Gas Operating Revenue Natural gas operating revenue increased $107.3 million primarily due to higher retail sales of $ 148.1 million and increased other decoupling revenue of $5.9 million ; partially offset by a decrease in decoupling revenue of $48.6 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P89_S1	These items are discussed in the following details:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P90_S0	Natural gas retail sales increased $148.1 million due to an increase of $155.1 million in natural gas sales, which is a result of an increase in natural gas load of 18.0% from 2016, partially offset by a decrease in revenue per therm of $6.9 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P90_S1	The decrease in revenue per therm was primarily due to a rate decrease on customer bills for PGA, which decreased rates 0.4% effective November 1, 2016 and increase in decoupling rates of 2.4% effective May 1, 2017, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 7 of this report for natural gas rate changes.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P90_S2	Natural gas load increased primarily due to the increase in average therms used per residential and commercial customers of 17.4% and 18.9%, respectively, compared to 2016 as a result of a 19.9% increase in heating degree days and an increase of 1.5% in natural gas customers, which increased the natural gas heating load compared to prior year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P91_S0	Decoupling revenue decreased $48.6 million primarily due to an increase in use per customer, driven by an increase in heating degree days as discussed above in natural gas retail sales.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P91_S1	This caused actual revenue to increase closer to PSE's allowed revenue, which lowered decoupled revenue in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P92_S0	Other decoupling revenue increased $5.9 million due to the following: (i) an increase in decoupling collections of $14.7 million from an increase in the amortization rate in 2017 and an increase in therms used; (ii) in 2017, there was $19.6 million of deferred decoupling revenue that was recognized as it met the alternative revenue program revenue recognition criteria that it is expected to be collected from customers within 24 months, compared to the 24-month reserve of $9.6 million in 2016; and (iii) an increase in net overearnings accruals and cash refunds of $8.6 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P93_S0	Natural Gas Energy Costs Purchased natural gas expense increased $46.1 million due to an increase in natural gas costs included in PGA rates effective November 1, 2016 as compared to those effective November 1, 2015, and an increase in natural gas usage of 18.0%.

1085392_18_ITEM7_P116_S0	2016 compared to 2017 Summary Results of Operations Puget Energy s net income decreased by $137.7 million , which is primarily attributable to an income tax expense increase of $79.3 million , as well as PSE's net income decrease of $60.5 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P116_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P117_S0	Income Tax Expense increased by $79.3 million primarily due to tax reform passed on December 22, 2017 that lowered the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P117_S1	As a result, income tax expense was effected by the revaluation of Puget Energy's deferred tax assets at the 21.0% rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P118_S0	2015 compared to 2016 Summary Results of Operations Puget Energy s net income increased by $71.7 million, which is primarily attributable to PSE's net income increase of $76.4 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P118_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted Puget Energy s net income which are not included in PSE s discussion:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P119_S0	Non-utility expense and other increased $5.1 million primarily due to legal outside services of $2.8 million and qualified pension expense of $1.2 million.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P120_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P121_S0	_______________ Energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of PSE s obligation to serve retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P121_S1	As a result, costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P121_S2	For individual long-term debt maturities, see Note 6 , "Long-Term Debt," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P121_S3	For Puget Energy, the amount above excludes the fair value adjustments related to the merger.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P121_S4	For additional information, see Note 8 , "Leases" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P122_S0	The following are PSE s and Puget Energy s aggregate availability under commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM7_P123_S0	_______________ As of December 31, 2017 , PSE had a credit facility which provides $ 800.0 million of short-term liquidity needs and includes a backstop to the Company's commercial paper program.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P123_S1	The credit facility matures in October 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P123_S2	The credit facility also includes a swingline feature allowing same day availability on borrowings up to $ 75.0 million and an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the total size of the facility to $ 1.4 billion .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P123_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , no loans or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility and $ 329.5 million was outstanding under the commercial paper program.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S0	The credit agreement is syndicated among numerous lenders.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S1	Outside of the credit agreement, PSE has a $ 3.1 million letter of credit in support of a long-term transmission contract and a $ 1.0 million letter of credit in support of natural gas purchases in Canada.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , PSE had a revolving credit facility with Puget Energy in the form of a promissory note to borrow up to $ 30.0 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , Puget Energy had a revolving senior secured credit facility totaling $ 800.0 million , which matures in October 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S4	The revolving senior secured credit facility is syndicated among numerous lenders.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S5	The revolving senior secured credit facility also has an expansion feature that, upon the banks' approval, would increase the size of the facility to $ 1.3 billion .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P124_S6	As of December 31, 2017 , there was $ 102.6 million drawn and outstanding under the Puget Energy credit facility.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P125_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company's financial condition, other than the items disclosed in Note 8, "Leases" and in Note 15, "Commitment and Contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 2 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P126_S0	Utility Construction Program PSE s construction programs for generating facilities, the electric transmission system, the natural gas and electric distribution systems and the Tacoma LNG facility are designed to meet regulatory requirements and customer growth and to support reliable energy delivery.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P126_S1	Construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, totaled $963.7 million in 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P126_S2	Presently planned utility construction expenditures, excluding equity AFUDC, are as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P127_S0	The program is subject to change based upon general business, economic and regulatory conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P128_S0	Utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures are typically funded from a combination of cash from operations, short-term debt, long-term debt and/or equity.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P128_S1	PSE s utility construction program expenditures periodically can and do exceed cash flow generated from operations.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P128_S2	As a result, execution of PSE s utility construction program is dependent, in part, on continued access to capital markets.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	_______________ Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and miscellaneous non-cash items.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P129_S2	Other non-current assets and liabilities include funding of pension liability.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $ 267.9 million including a net income decrease of $ 60.5 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	The following are significant factors that impacted PSE's cash flows from operations:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	Non-cash items increased $151.5 million primarily due to changes in derivative instruments of $114.6 million , depreciation and amortization of $42.4 million , deferred taxes of $36.1 million and conservation amortization of $13.4 million offset by a decrease of $53.3 million in production tax credits.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	For further discussion, see Other Operating Expenses in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 13, "Income Taxes" in Item 8.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital increased $151.8 million primarily due to changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of $50.7 million, an increase to the purchased gas adjustment of $34.2 million as discussed previously in the electric and natural gas margin discussion, an increase of $27.5 million in materials and supplies, and an increase of $47.0 million in prepayments.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	Regulatory assets and liabilities cash flow increased $63.9 million primarily due to changes in decoupling and derivatives offset by changes in purchased gas adjustments.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Other non-current assets and liabilities cash flow decreased $38.8 million primarily due to an increase in the long-term incentive plan accrual, an increase in major maintenance and inspections, reduced pension funding and other changes in long-term assets and liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	_______________ Non-cash items include depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, AFUDC-equity, production tax credits and other miscellaneous non-cash items.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	Changes in working capital include receivables, unbilled revenue, materials/supplies, fuel/gas inventory, income taxes, prepayments, purchased gas adjustments, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P135_S2	Other non-current assets and liabilities include funding of pension liability.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	Year Ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 Cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $242.8 million compared to the same period in 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	The net difference was primarily impacted by the increase from cash flow provided by the operating activities of PSE, as previously discussed.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P136_S2	The remaining variance is explained below:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	Non-cash items increased $83.6 million primarily due to changes in deferred taxes of $78.8 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P137_S1	For further discussion, see Note 13, "Income Taxes" in Item 8.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Changes in cash flow resulting from working capital decreased $33.2 million primarily due to amounts owed to PSE related to Puget LNG.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	Financing Program The Company s external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	The Company anticipates refinancing the redemption of bonds or other long-term borrowings with its credit facilities and/or the issuance of new long-term debt.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S2	Access to funds depends upon factors such as Puget Energy s and PSE s credit ratings, prevailing interest rates and investor receptivity to investing in the utility industry, Puget Energy and PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S3	The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity through its credit facilities and access to capital markets to fund its needs over the next twelve months.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S4	Proceeds from PSE s short-term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and the interim funding of utility construction programs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S5	Puget Energy and PSE continue to have reasonable access to the capital and credit markets.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P139_S6	For information on Puget Energy and PSE dividends, long-term debt and credit facilities, see Note 4, Dividend Payment Restrictions, Note 6, Long-term Debt and Note 7, Liquidity Facilities and Other Financing Arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Debt Restrictive Covenants The type and amount of future long-term financings for PSE may be limited by provisions in PSE's electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	PSE s ability to issue additional secured debt may also be limited by certain restrictions contained in its electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	Under the most restrictive tests, at December 31, 2017 , PSE could issue:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	Approximately $ 535.0 million of additional first mortgage bonds under PSE s natural gas mortgage indenture based on approximately $ 891.7 million of natural gas bondable property available for issuance, subject to a combined natural gas and electric interest coverage test of 1.75 times net earnings available for interest and a natural gas interest coverage test of 2.0 times net earnings available for interest (as defined in the natural gas utility mortgage), both of which PSE exceeded at December 31, 2017 At December 31, 2017 , PSE had approximately $ 7.2 billion in electric and natural gas rate base to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	Other Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P142_S1	Management believes the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of estimates, assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed during the month less unbilled revenues recorded in the prior month.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P144_S2	The "current" month unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	Beginning July 1, 2013, certain revenues from PSE's electric and natural gas operations are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue due to weather and gross margin erosion related to energy efficiency.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	Any differences are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or a regulatory liability for over recovery.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	Revenues associated with power costs under the PCA mechanism and PGA rates are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	As defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980), the decoupling mechanism is an alternative revenue program that allows billings to be adjusted for the effects of weather abnormalities, conservation efforts or other various external factors.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P146_S1	PSE adjusts these billings in the future in response to these effects to collect additional revenues provided under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	the additional revenue can be recognized when the following criteria specified by ASC 980 are met: (i) the program is established by an order from the Washington Commission that allows for automatic adjustment of future rates, (ii) the amount of additional revenues for the period is objectively determinable and is probable of recovery and (iii) the additional revenues will be collected within 24 months following the end of the annual period in which they are recognized.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	PSE meets the criteria to recognize revenue under the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P147_S2	The Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P147_S3	Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recorded amounts will be recorded.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	Regulatory Accounting As a regulated entity of the Washington Commission and FERC, PSE prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of ASC 980.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	The application of ASC 980 results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenue and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	The rates that are charged by PSE to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the Washington Commission and FERC.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	Under the authority of these commissions, PSE has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 in the amount of $953.1 million and $1,758.6 million , respectively, and regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 of $1.1 billion and $653.3 million , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P150_S2	Such amounts are amortized through a corresponding liability or asset account, respectively, with no impact to earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	PSE expects to fully recover its regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, PSE would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	In addition, if PSE determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, PSE could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	Also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to ASC 980 are the PCA and PGA mechanisms.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P152_S1	The PCA and PGA mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the Company and are approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	The PCA mechanism provides for a sharing of costs that vary from baseline rates over a graduated scale.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P153_S1	For further discussion regarding the PCA mechanism, see Item 7, "Business Regulation and Rates".
1085392_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	The increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are reflected in customer bills through the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	PSE expects to fully recover/refund these regulatory balances through its rates.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P154_S2	However, both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the Washington Commission on a periodic basis.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, (ASC 350) requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a qualitative and quantitative test.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	Management must first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances during a qualitative assessment, management determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a quantitative test to determine impairment.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P160_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	Puget Energy conducted its most recent annual impairment test as of October 1, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using the weighted-averages from an income valuation method, or discounted cash flow method, and a market valuation approach.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P162_S1	These valuations required significant judgments, including: (i) estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts and other market factors, (ii) estimation of the long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy s business including other market factors, (iii) estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, (iv) the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy, and (v) the determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	Management estimated the fair value of Puget Energy s equity to be approximately $5.5 billion at the October 1, 2017 measurement date for the annual test of goodwill impairment.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	The carrying value of Puget Energy s equity was approximately $3.8 billion with the excess of the fair value over the carrying value representing 44.7% or $1.7 billion.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P163_S2	The income approach and the market approach valuations resulted in Puget Energy equity values of $5.2 and $5.8 billion, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P163_S3	The result of the income approach was very sensitive to long-term cash flow growth rates applicable to periods beyond management s five-year business plan and financial forecast period and the weighted-average cost of capital assumptions of 3.0% and 5.9%, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P163_S4	The following table summarizes the results of the income valuation method, using the long-term growth rate and weighted average cost of capital:
1085392_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Derivatives ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	Generally, NPNS applies to contracts with creditworthy counterparties, for which physical delivery is probable and in quantities that will be used in the normal course of business.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	Power purchases designated as NPNS must meet additional criteria to determine if the transaction is within PSE s forecasted load requirements and if the counterparty owns or controls energy resources within the western region to allow for physical delivery of the energy.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	Natural gas derivative contracts qualify for deferral under ASC 980 due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying their financial reporting.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P167_S2	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P167_S3	For these contracts and contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	PSE values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P169_S1	The Company regularly confirms the validity of pricing service quoted prices (e.g. Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) used to value commodity contracts to the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P169_S2	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, PSE uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	The Company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	PSE is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P171_S2	The Company economically hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P171_S3	The exposure position is determined by using a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how the Company s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydrological and unit performance conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P172_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P172_S2	For additional information, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" Note 9, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 10 , "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Fair Value ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P173_S1	However, as permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P173_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P173_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that this approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P174_S1	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P174_S2	For further discussion on market risk, see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk".
1085392_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits PSE has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P175_S1	PSE recognized qualified pension expense of $12.1 million , $14.5 million and $22.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P175_S2	Of these amounts, approximately 51.6%, 55.5% and 58.5% were included in utility operations and maintenance expense in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and the remaining amounts were capitalized.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P175_S3	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Puget Energy recognized incremental qualified pension income of $13.4 million and $15.5 million , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P175_S4	In 2018 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $11.5 million and incremental qualified pension income of $13.0 million, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	PSE has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
1085392_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	PSE recognized pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of $4.8 million , $4.8 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Puget Energy recognized incremental income of $0.5 million and $0.4 million , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P176_S3	In 2018 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize pension expense of $5.1 million and incremental pension income of $0.5 million, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	PSE also has other limited postretirement benefit plans.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	PSE recognized income of $0.5 million , $0.5 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Puget Energy recognized incremental expense of $0.2 million each year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P178_S2	In 2018 , it is expected that PSE and Puget Energy will recognize income of $0.5 million and incremental expense of $0.2 million, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P178_S3	The Company s pension and other postretirement benefits income or expense depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, mortality and health care cost trends.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P178_S4	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that the Company records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P179_S1	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains or losses measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P179_S2	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P179_S3	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P179_S4	During 2017 , the Company made cash contributions of $18.0 million to the qualified defined benefit plan.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	Management is closely monitoring the funding status of its qualified pension plan.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S1	At December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company s qualified pension plan was $3.9 million overfunded and $32.3 million underfunded as measured under GAAP, or 100.6% and 95.0% funded, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S2	As of January 1, 2018 , the plan's estimated funded ratio, as calculated under guidelines from The Pension Protection Act of 2006 and considering temporary interest rate relief measures approved by Congress, was more than 100%.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S3	The aggregate expected contributions and payments by the Company to fund the pension plan, SERP and other postretirement plans for the year ending December 31, 2018 are expected to be at least $18.0 million , $5.5 million and $0.3 million , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S4	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit obligations decreased from 4.50% in 2016 to 4.00% in 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S5	The discount rate used in accounting for pension and other benefit expense decreased from 4.65% in 2016 to 4.50% in 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S6	The rate of return on plan assets for qualified pension benefits decreased from 7.75% in 2016 to 7.45% in 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7_P180_S7	The rate of return on plan assets for other benefits in 2017 and 2016 was 6.75% , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	The following tables reflect the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions (each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes):
1085392_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For the discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 , "New Accounting Pronouncements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Energy Portfolio Management PSE maintains energy risk policies and procedures to manage commodity and volatility risks and the related effects on credit, tax, accounting, financing and liquidity.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	PSE s Energy Management Committee establishes PSE s risk management policies and procedures and monitors compliance.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P0_S2	The Energy Management Committee is comprised of certain PSE officers and is overseen by the PSE Board of Directors.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	PSE's objective is to minimize commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the natural gas and electric portfolios.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	It is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S2	PSE hedges open natural gas and electric positions to reduce both the portfolio risk and the volatility risk in prices.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S3	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools including a probabilistic risk system that models 250 simulations of how PSE s natural gas and power portfolios will perform under various weather, hydroelectric and unit performance conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S4	Based on the analytics from all of its models and tools, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options to manage its electric and natural gas portfolio risks.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P1_S5	The forward physical electric and natural gas contracts are both fixed and variable (at index).
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	To fix the price of wholesale electricity and natural gas, PSE may enter into fixed-for-floating swap (financial) contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S1	PSE also utilizes natural gas call and put options as an additional hedging instrument to increase the hedging portfolio's flexibility to react to commodity price fluctuations.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P2_S2	The following table presents the fair value of the Company s energy derivatives instruments, recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	At December 31, 2017 , the Company had total assets of $ 24.4 million and total liabilities of $ 86.1 million related to derivative contracts used to hedge the supply and cost of electricity and natural gas to serve PSE customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	As the gains and losses in the electric portfolio are realized, they will be recorded as either purchased power costs or electric generation fuel costs under the PCA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P4_S1	Any fair value adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, due to the PGA mechanism, which passes the cost of natural gas supply to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P4_S2	As the gains and losses on the hedges are realized in future periods, they will be recorded as natural gas costs under the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P4_S3	A hypothetical 10.0% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company s derivative contracts by $10.6 million .
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The change in fair value of the Company s outstanding energy derivative instruments from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017 is summarized in the table below:
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The fair value of the Company s outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2017 , based on pricing source and the period during which the instrument will mature, is summarized below:
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	_______________ Prices provided by external pricing service, which utilizes broker quotes and pricing models.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	For further details regarding both the fair value of derivative instruments and the impacts such instruments have on current period earnings, see Note 9, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Contingent Features and Counterparty Credit Risk PSE is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve customers.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P10_S1	PSE manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty analysis and measurement, monitoring and mitigation of exposure.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P10_S2	PSE has entered into commodity master arrangements with its counterparties to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P10_S3	PSE generally enters into the following master arrangements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements which standardize physical power contracts in the electric industry; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements which standardize physical natural gas contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P10_S4	PSE believes that entering into such agreements reduces the credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause PSE to have material credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, PSE could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S2	In order to mitigate concentrated credit risk with a subset of counterparties, PSE executed a futures and cleared swaps agreement in November 2016, and began transacting power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in early 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S3	Where deemed appropriate, and when allowed under the terms of the agreements, PSE may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate the potential credit default losses.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P11_S5	As of December 31, 2017 , PSE held approximately $458.5 million in standby letters of credit or limited parental guarantees and had 6 counterparties with unlimited parental guarantees, in support of various electric and natural gas transactions.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default swap rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P12_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , approximately 83.6% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, including NPNS transactions, were entered into with investment grade counterparties which, in the majority of cases, do not require collateral calls on the contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	Counterparty credit risk may impact PSE's decisions on derivative accounting treatment.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Should a counterparty file for bankruptcy, which would be considered a default under master arrangements, PSE may terminate related contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Derivative accounting entries previously recorded would be reversed in the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P15_S0	PSE would compute any terminations receivable or payable, based on the terms of existing master agreements.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P15_S1	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P15_S2	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in determination of reserves.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P15_S3	The Company recognizes that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty s risk of default.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P15_S4	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor s and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted-average default tenor for that counterparty s deals.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P16_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals by counterparty and arriving at an average value.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P16_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P17_S0	The Company applies the counterparty s default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P17_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P17_S2	The fair value of derivatives includes the impact of credit and non-performance reserves.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P17_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of its counterparties, therefore the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the year.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , PSE has posted a $1.0 million letter of credit as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P19_S0	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Interest Rate Risk The Company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short-term debt instruments, variable-rate leases and anticipated long-term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P20_S1	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt of various maturities.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P20_S2	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P20_S3	Short-term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed-rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P20_S4	The following table presents the carrying value and fair value of Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy's debt instruments:
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P21_S0	For further details regarding Puget Energy and Puget Sound Energy debt instruments, see Note 6, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P22_S0	From time to time, PSE may enter into treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to an anticipated debt issuance.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The ending balance in OCI related to the forward starting swaps and previously settled treasury lock contracts at December 31, 2017 was a net loss of $5.0 million after tax and accumulated amortization.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P22_S2	This compares to an after-tax loss of $5.4 million in OCI as of December 31, 2016 .
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P23_S0	All financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by an officer, presented to the Board of Directors, or a committee of the Board, as applicable and are approved prior to execution.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P23_S1	PSE had no treasury locks or forward starting swap contracts outstanding at December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The Company may also enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_18_ITEM7A_P23_S3	In January 2017, Puget Energy's outstanding interest rate swaps matured, and as of December 31, 2017 , the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	All other schedules have been omitted because of the absence of the conditions under which they are required, or because the information required is included in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P16_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P17_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P17_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P18_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P18_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	We have served as the Company or its predecessor s auditor since 1933.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of Puget Sound Energy, Inc.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and financial statement schedule, of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (the Company) and its subsidiary as listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).

1085392_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	Basis of Presentation Puget Energy, Inc. (Puget Energy) is an energy services holding company that owns Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (PSE).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	PSE is a public utility incorporated in the state of Washington that furnishes electric and natural gas services in a territory covering 6,000 square miles, primarily in the Puget Sound region.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	Puget Energy also has a wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary, named Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG), formed in 2016, which has the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility, currently under construction.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P41_S3	PSE and Puget LNG are considered related parties with similar ownership by Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P41_S4	Therefore, capital and operating costs that occur under PSE and are allocated to Puget LNG are related party transactions by nature.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , Puget LNG has incurred $104.3 million in construction work in progress and operating costs related to Puget LNG s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The consolidated financial statements of Puget Energy reflect the accounts of Puget Energy and its subsidiaries.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PSE and its subsidiary.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P43_S2	Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	The consolidated financial statements are presented after elimination of all significant intercompany items and transactions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P44_S1	PSE s consolidated financial statements continue to be accounted for on a historical basis and do not include any ASC 805 purchase accounting adjustments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P45_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	Utility Plant Puget Energy and PSE capitalize, at original cost, additions to utility plant, including renewals and betterments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	Costs include indirect costs such as engineering, supervision, certain taxes, pension and other employee benefits and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P46_S2	Replacements of minor items of property are included in maintenance expense.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P46_S3	When the utility plant is retired and removed from service, the original cost of the property is charged to accumulated depreciation and costs associated with removal of the property, less salvage, are charged to the cost of removal regulatory liability.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Planned Major Maintenance Planned major maintenance is an activity that typically occurs when PSE overhauls or substantially upgrades various systems and equipment on a scheduled basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Costs related to planned major maintenance are deferred and amortized to the next scheduled major maintenance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	This accounting method also follows the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission) regulatory treatment related to these generating facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	Other Property and Investments For PSE, the costs of other property and investments (i.e., non-utility) are stated at historical cost.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	Expenditures for refurbishment and improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life of an asset are capitalized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	Replacements of minor items are expensed on a current basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Gains and losses on assets sold or retired, which were previously recorded in utility plant, are apportioned between regulatory assets/liabilities and earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	However, gains and losses on assets sold or retired, not previously recorded in utility plant, are reflected in earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Depreciation and Amortization The Company provides for depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	Amortization is recorded for intangibles such as regulatory assets and liabilities, computer software and franchises.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P50_S2	The annual depreciation provision stated as a percent of a depreciable electric utility plant was 2.8% , for each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ; depreciable natural gas utility plant was 3.4% , for each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 ; and depreciable common utility plant was 8.3% , 9.7% and 8.5% in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P50_S3	The cost of removal is collected from PSE s customers through depreciation expense and any excess is recorded as a regulatory liability.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	Goodwill In 2009, Puget Holdings completed its merger with Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Puget Energy remeasured the carrying amount of all its assets and liabilities to fair value, which resulted in recognition of approximately $1.7 billion in goodwill.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the Company s business or regulatory outlook, legal factors, a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or significant changes in the financial markets which could influence the Company s access to capital and interest rates.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of the reporting units.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	Management has determined Puget Energy has only one reporting unit.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The goodwill recorded by Puget Energy represents the potential long-term return to the Company s investors.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Goodwill is tested for impairment annually using a qualitative and quantitative test.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Management must first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances during a qualitative assessment, management determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the entity shall perform a quantitative test to determine impairment.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	This would entail a full valuation of Puget Energy s assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts, with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	Goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Puget Energy conducted its annual impairment test in 2017 using an October 1, 2017 measurement date.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	The fair value of Puget Energy s reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flow and market approach.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	The discounted cash flow approach requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of long-term rate of growth for Puget Energy business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, the selection of utility holding companies determined to be comparable to Puget Energy and determination of an appropriate weighted-average cost of capital or discount rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	The market approach estimates the fair value of the business based on market prices of stocks of comparable companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	In addition, indications of market value are estimated by deriving multiples of equity or invested capital to various measures of revenue, earnings or cash flow.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	Changes in these estimates and/or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment of the reporting unit.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P58_S3	Based on the test performed, management has determined that there was no indication of impairment of Puget Energy s goodwill as of October 1, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P58_S4	There were no known events or circumstances from the date of the assessment through December 31, 2017 that would impact management s conclusion.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Tacoma LNG facility is intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE s natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	By storing surplus natural gas, PSE is able to meet the requirements of peak consumption later during different seasons.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P59_S2	LNG will also provide fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	On January 24, 2018, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency s determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement is necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S1	As a result of requiring a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, the Company's construction schedule may be impacted depending on the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency's timing and decision on the air quality permit.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S2	If delayed, the construction schedule and costs may be adversely impacted.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S3	Pursuant to the Washington Commission s order, PSE will be allocated approximately 43.0% of common capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of Tacoma LNG facility.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S4	The remaining 57.0% of common capital and operating costs of the Tacoma LNG facility will be allocated to Puget LNG.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S5	For Puget Energy, $104.0 million in construction work in progress related to Puget LNG s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the Other property and investments financial statement line item.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P60_S6	For PSE, construction work in progress of $87.2 million related to PSE s portion of the Tacoma LNG facility is reported in the Utility plant - Natural gas plant line item, as PSE is a regulated entity.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand bank deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are reported at cost and approximate fair value, due to the short-term maturity.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	Materials and Supplies Materials and supplies are used primarily in the operation and maintenance of electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems as well as spare parts for combustion turbines used for the generation of electricity.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Company records these items at weighted-average cost.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	Fuel and Natural Gas Inventory Fuel and natural gas inventory is used in the generation of electricity and for future sales to the Company s natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	Fuel inventory consists of coal, diesel and natural gas used for generation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	Natural gas inventory consists of natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) held in storage for future sales.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	The Company records these items at the lower of cost or net realizable value method.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities PSE accounts for its regulated operations in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations (ASC 980).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P64_S1	ASC 980 requires PSE to defer certain costs or losses that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P64_S2	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P64_S3	Accounting under ASC 980 is appropriate as long as rates are established by or subject to approval by independent third-party regulators; rates are designed to recover the specific enterprise s cost of service; and in view of demand for service, it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover costs can be charged to and collected from customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	In most cases, PSE classifies regulatory assets and liabilities as long-term when amortization periods extend longer than one year.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P65_S1	For further details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P66_S0	Puget Energy recorded regulatory assets and liabilities at the time of the merger related to power purchase contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S0	Allowance for Funds Used During Construction AFUDC represents the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S1	The amount of AFUDC recorded in each accounting period varies depending primarily upon the level of construction work in progress and the AFUDC rate used.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S2	AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant; the AFUDC debt portion is credited to interest expense, while the AFUDC equity portion is credited to other income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S3	Cash inflow related to AFUDC does not occur until these charges are reflected in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S4	The current AFUDC rate authorized by the Washington Commission for natural gas and electric utility plant additions through December 18, 2017 was 7.77% .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S5	Effective December 19, 2017 with the Washington Commission order, the new AFUDC rate authorized is 7.60% .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S6	The Washington Commission authorized the Company to calculate AFUDC using its allowed rate of return.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S7	To the extent amounts calculated using this rate exceed the AFUDC calculated rate using the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) formula, PSE capitalizes the excess as a deferred asset, crediting other income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P67_S8	The deferred asset is being amortized over the average useful life of PSE s non-project electric utility plant which is approximately 30 years .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P68_S0	Revenue Recognition Operating utility revenue is recognized when the basis of services is rendered, which includes estimated unbilled revenue, in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition (ASC 605).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P69_S0	Revenue from retail sales is billed based on tariff rates approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P70_S0	PSE's estimate of unbilled revenue is based on a calculation using meter readings from its automated meter reading (AMR) system.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P70_S1	The estimate calculates unbilled usage at the end of each month as the difference between the customer meter readings on the last day of the month and the last customer meter readings billed.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P70_S2	The unbilled usage is then priced at published rates for each tariff rate schedule to estimate the unbilled revenues by customer.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P71_S0	PSE collected Washington State excise taxes (which are a component of general retail customer rates) and municipal taxes totaling $257.1 million , $235.3 million and $234.2 million for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company reports the collection of such taxes on a gross basis in operation revenue and as expense in taxes other than income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	PSE's electric and natural gas operations contain a revenue decoupling mechanism under which PSE's actual energy delivery revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs are compared with authorized revenues allowed under the mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The mechanism mitigates volatility in revenue and gross margin erosion due to weather and energy efficiency.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	Any differences in revenue are deferred to a regulatory asset for under recovery or regulatory liability for over recovery under alternative revenue recognition standard.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	Revenue is recognized under this program when deemed collectible within 24 months based on alternative revenue recognition guidance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Decoupled rate increases are effective May 1 of each year subject to a 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Any excess revenue above 3.0% will be included in the following year's decoupled rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S2	The Company will be able to recognize revenue below the 3.0% cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S3	For revenue deferrals exceeding the annual 3.0% rate cap of total revenue for decoupled rate schedules, the Company will assess the excess amount to determine its ability to be collected within 24 months.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S4	On December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P73_S5	The rate test which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P74_S0	Company will not record any decoupling revenue that is expected to take longer than 24 months to collect following the end of the annual period in which the revenues would have otherwise been recognized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Once determined to be collectible within 24 months, any previously non-recognized amounts will be recognized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	Revenues associated with energy costs under the power cost adjustment (PCA) mechanism and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanism are excluded from the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P75_S0	Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts are provided for electric and natural gas customer accounts based upon a historical experience rate of write-offs of energy accounts receivable along with information on future economic outlook.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P75_S1	The allowance account is adjusted monthly for this experience rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	The allowance account is maintained until either receipt of payment or the likelihood of collection is considered remote at which time the allowance account and corresponding receivable balance are written off.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	The Company s balance for allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $8.9 million and $9.8 million , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P76_S0	Self-Insurance PSE is self-insured for storm damage and environmental contamination occurring on PSE-owned property.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P76_S1	In addition, PSE is required to meet a deductible for a portion of the risk associated with comprehensive liability, workers compensation claims and catastrophic property losses other than those which are storm related.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P76_S2	Under the December 5, 2017 Washington Commission order regarding PSE s GRC, the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism increased from $8.0 million to $10.0 million effective January 1, 2018.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P76_S3	Additionally, costs may only be deferred if the outage meets the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P77_S0	Federal Income Taxes For presentation in Puget Energy's and PSE s separate financial statements, income taxes are allocated to the subsidiaries on the basis of separate company computations of tax, modified by allocating certain consolidated group limitations which are attributed to the separate company.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P77_S1	Taxes payable or receivable are settled with Puget Holdings, which is the ultimate tax payer.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S0	Natural Gas Off-System Sales and Capacity Release PSE contracts for firm natural gas supplies and holds firm transportation and storage capacity sufficient to meet the expected peak winter demand for natural gas by its firm customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S1	Due to the variability in weather, winter peaking consumption of natural gas by most of its customers and other factors, PSE holds contractual rights to natural gas supplies and transportation and storage capacity in excess of its average annual requirements to serve firm customers on its distribution system.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S2	For much of the year, there is excess capacity available for third-party natural gas sales, exchanges and capacity releases.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S3	PSE sells excess natural gas supplies, enters into natural gas supply exchanges with third parties outside of its distribution area and releases to third parties excess interstate natural gas pipeline capacity and natural gas storage rights on a short-term basis to mitigate the costs of firm transportation and storage capacity for its core natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S4	The proceeds from such activities, net of transactional costs, are accounted for as reductions in the cost of purchased natural gas and passed on to customers through the PGA mechanism, with no direct impact on net income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P78_S5	As a result, PSE nets the sales revenue and associated cost of sales for these transactions in purchased natural gas.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P79_S0	As part of the Company s electric operations, PSE purchases natural gas for its gas-fired generation facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P79_S1	The projected volume of natural gas for power is relative to the price of natural gas.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P79_S2	Based on the market prices for natural gas, PSE may use the natural gas it has already purchased to generate power or PSE may sell the already purchased natural gas.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P79_S3	The net proceeds from selling natural gas, previously purchased for power generation, are accounted for in electric operating revenue and are included in the PCA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S0	Production Tax Credit Production Tax Credits (PTCs) represent federal income tax incentives available to taxpayers that generate energy from qualifying renewable sources during the first ten years of operation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S1	From a regulatory perspective, the tax savings from these credits were intended to be refunded by PSE to its customers when monetized on the income tax return through its revenue requirement as initially approved by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S2	As the Company has not generated taxable income and these credits have not been monetized, they have not been refunded to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S3	Amounts to be refunded have been recorded as a liability with an offsetting reduction to revenue as it was intended to be refunded through the revenue requirement.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S4	A deferred tax asset and reduction to deferred tax expense was also recorded for PTCs not yet monetized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S5	These entries resulted in no net income impact.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P80_S6	In connection with the GRC settlement in 2017, the Washington Commission authorized the Company to utilize the tax savings associated with the monetization of the PTCs to fund the following: (i) Colstrip Community Transition Fund, (ii) unrecovered Colstrip plant and (iii) incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P81_S0	refunded to customers through the revenue requirement, a non-cash charge to revenue and deferred tax expense will be recorded as the PTCs are monetized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P81_S1	These entries will result in no net income impact.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P81_S2	At December 31, 2017 $2.1 million of PTCs are estimated to be monetized through tax filings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P82_S0	Accounting for Derivatives ASC 815 requires that all contracts considered to be derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value unless the contracts qualify for an exception.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	PSE enters into derivative contracts to manage its energy resource portfolio and interest rate exposure including forward physical and financial contracts and swaps.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	Some of PSE s physical electric supply contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) exception to derivative accounting rules.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	PSE may enter into financial fixed price contracts to economically hedge the variability of certain index-based contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P84_S1	Those contracts that do not meet the NPNS exception are marked-to-market to current earnings in the statements of income, subject to deferral under ASC 980, for natural gas related derivatives due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	Puget Energy and PSE elected to de-designate all energy related derivative contracts previously recorded as cash flow hedges for the purpose of simplifying its financial reporting.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	The contracts that were de-designated related to physical electric supply contracts and natural gas swap contracts used to fix the price of natural gas for electric generation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P85_S2	For these contracts and for contracts initiated after such date, all mark-to-market adjustments are recognized through earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	The amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) is transferred to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings or sooner if management determines that the forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P86_S1	When these contracts are settled, the contract price becomes part of purchased electricity or electric generation fuel which becomes part of PSE s PCA mechanism and the unrealized gain or loss is listed separately under energy costs, as it represents the non-rate treatment of energy costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial derivative instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with its long-term debt financing and debt instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , Puget Energy has interest rate swap contracts outstanding originally related to its long-term debt.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	For additional information, see Note 9 , "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	Fair Value Measurements of Derivatives ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	As permitted under ASC 820, the Company utilizes a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for valuing the majority of its assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	The Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S3	These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S4	The Company primarily applies the market approach for recurring fair value measurements as it believes that the approach is used by market participants for these types of assets and liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S5	Accordingly, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S6	The Company values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P88_S7	When external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts, the Company uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P89_S0	All derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P89_S1	For additional information, see Note 10 , "Fair Value Measurements" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P90_S0	Debt Related Costs Debt premiums, discounts, expenses and amounts received or incurred to settle hedges are amortized over the life of the related debt for the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P90_S1	The premiums and costs associated with reacquired debt are deferred and amortized over the life of the related new issuance, in accordance with ratemaking treatment for PSE and presented net of long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P91_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ".
1085392_18_ITEM8_P91_S1	Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09 and the related amendments outline a single comprehensive model for use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	The standard is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018 and allows for two methods of adoption: application of the standard to each prior reporting period presented (full retrospective), or application of a cumulative effect on retained earnings recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective method).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P92_S3	The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	In preparation for adoption of the standard, the Company initiated a project team that met bi-weekly to make key accounting assessments related to the standard, which included the implementation of associated internal controls.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	As a result of implementation of this standard, the Company has concluded there to be no impact on revenue for contracts with customers open as of January 1, 2018 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Company's revenue is 93.6% comprised of contracts with customers from rate-regulated sales of electricity and natural gas to retail customers where revenue will continue to be recognized over time as delivered.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	Pursuant to the new standard, the Company's current presentation of revenue on the income statement will not change; however, enhanced disclosure for revenue from contracts with customers and revenue outside the scope of ASC 606 will be disclosed.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	Lease Accounting In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	The FASB issued this ASU and the related amendments to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing right-of-use (ROU) lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	To meet that objective, the FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creating Topic 842, Leases.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S2	This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S3	Earlier adoption is permitted for all entities upon issuance.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S6	The Company expects the adoption of the standard will result in recognition of right-of-use assets and liabilities that have not previously been recorded, which will have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P97_S7	For a current breakout of existing operating and capital leases, see Note 8, "Leases" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	Statement of Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, " Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ".
1085392_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The amendments in ASU 2016-15 provide guidance for eight specific cash flow issues that include (i) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, (iii) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (iv) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (v) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distribution received from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interest in securitization transactions, and (viii) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	Early adoption is permitted for all entities upon issuance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	The amendments in this update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The Company will adopt ASU 2016-15 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and is in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated statement of cash flows.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, " Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash ".
1085392_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P100_S2	The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 retrospectively to all periods presented by moving the presentation of restricted cash, in the statement of cash flows, to net cash flows of total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P100_S3	Additionally, the Company will disclose the nature of the Company's restricted cash.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	Retirement Benefits In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, " Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost ".
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S1	The amendments require that an employer report the service cost component in the same line items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S2	The other components of net benefit cost (which include interest costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost or credits and actuarial gains and losses) are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S3	The line item used in the income statement to present the other components of net benefit cost must be disclosed.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S4	Additionally, the service cost component of net benefit cost is the only eligible cost for capitalization.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P101_S5	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Company will adopt ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 by applying the amendments related to income statement activity retrospectively, and balance sheet activity prospectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company s non-service components for the year ended December 31, 2017 , was a credit of $18.4 million for Puget Energy and $4.7 million for PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P103_S1	The non-service cost components are in an income position and will be presented in the other income section, upon adoption.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	Stranded Tax Effects in AOCI In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, " Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income " .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S1	The amendments in this update allow reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S2	This amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S3	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for reporting periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S4	The Company will early adopt ASU 2018-02 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 through a retrospective reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P104_S5	The Company is still evaluating the impact of the reclassification to retained earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P105_S0	Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Regulatory accounting allows PSE to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that future rates will permit recovery of such costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P105_S1	It similarly requires deferral of revenues or gains that are expected to be returned to customers in the future.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P106_S0	The net regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included the following:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	_______________ (a) Amortization periods vary depending on timing of underlying transactions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	(b) The balance is dependent upon the cost of removal of underlying assets and the life of utility plant.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P107_S2	(c) Amortization will begin once PTCs are utilized by PSE on its tax return.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P107_S3	(d) For additional information, see Note 13,"Income Taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P108_S0	_______________ (a) Puget Energy s regulatory assets and liabilities include purchase accounting adjustments under ASC 805.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P109_S0	If the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of ASC 980, the Company would be required to write-off its regulatory assets and liabilities related to those operations not meeting ASC 980 requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P109_S1	Discontinuation of ASC 980 could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P110_S0	In accordance with guidance provided by ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO), PSE reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability $389.6 million and $369.3 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively, for the cost of removal of utility plant.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P110_S1	These amounts are collected from PSE s customers through depreciation rates.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S0	General Rate Case Filing On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission, which proposed a weighted cost of capital of 7.74% , or 6.69% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.8% .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S1	The requested combined electric tariff changes would result in a net increase of $86.3 million or 4.1% , annually.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S2	The requested combined natural gas tariff changes would result in a net decrease of $22.3 million , or 2.4% , annually.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S3	Additionally, a depreciation study which calculates annual depreciation accruals related to utility plant was filed as part of the GRC filing.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S4	The tariffs were subsequently suspended, which means that the final rates authorized in the proceeding would go into effect on or shortly after the suspension date of December 13, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S5	PSE filed a supplemental filing in the GRC on April 3, 2017, which among other things provided updates to power costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S6	The requested combined electric tariff changes based on the updated supplemental filing would result in a net increase of $67.9 million , or 3.2% , annually.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S7	The requested combined natural gas tariff changes based on the updated supplemental filing would result in a net decrease of $29.3 million , or 3.2% , annually.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S8	PSE s GRC filing included the required plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 closures, see Note 14, "Litigation" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S9	The filing also requested that electric energy supply fixed costs be included in PSE s decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P111_S10	Additionally, PSE s filing contained requests for two new mechanisms to address regulatory lag.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P112_S0	PSE requested procedures for an ERF that can be used to update PSE s delivery revenues on an expedited basis following a GRC proceeding.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P112_S1	PSE also requested approval to establish an electric cost recovery mechanism (CRM), similar to its existing natural gas CRM, which would allow PSE to obtain accelerated cost recovery on specified electric reliability projects.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S0	On September 15, 2017, ten of the eleven parties to the proceeding, including PSE, filed a multi-party settlement agreement with the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S1	The multi-party settlement resolved some, but not all, contested issues in the case.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S2	Hearings were held on August 30, 2017 regarding the contested issues and on September 29, 2017 regarding the multi-party settlement.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S3	The settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S5	The settlement agreement provides for a weighted cost of capital of 7.60% or 6.55% after-tax, and a capital structure of 48.5% in common equity with a return on equity of 9.5% .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P113_S6	The settlement also resulted in a combined electric tariff change that resulted in a net increase of $20.2 million , or 0.9% , and a combined natural gas tariff change that resulted in a net decrease of $35.5 million , or 3.8% .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S0	The expected closure date for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 is July 1, 2022 and the settlement included a plan to cover the costs for the closure of these Units.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S1	As part of the settlement PSE committed to fund a Colstrip Community Transition Fund of $10.0 million of which PSE shareholders will fund $5.0 million and $5.0 million will be funded by the regulatory liability for monetized PTCs, which are PTCs used on the filed tax returns.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S2	PSE is recognizing the funding of this commitment at the time the PTC s are accrued for use in the tax return.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S3	The settlement provided that the regulatory liability for monetized PTCs will be used for the following Colstrip costs: (i) Colstrip Community Transition Fund, (ii) recover unrecovered Colstrip plant and (iii) recover incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S4	In addition, the hydro-related treasury grants were allowed to be used to fund and recover incurred decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip 1 and 2 as established in RCW 80.04.350.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S5	Depreciation rates were updated which increased PSE's depreciation for Colstrip Units 1 and 2.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S6	The increase in depreciation caused the Colstrip regulatory asset to be reduced to $127.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P114_S7	Finally, depreciation rates for Colstrip Units 3 and 4 were also updated, which increased PSE's depreciation to recover plant costs for those units based on a negotiated depreciation life ending on December 31, 2027.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P115_S0	The contested issues were PSE s proposed electric CRM, the majority of decoupling issues, certain portions of electric rate spread/rate design issues and the entire natural gas rate spread/rate design-related issues.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P115_S1	The Washington Commission also ruled on the remaining contested issues on December 5, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P116_S0	The Washington Commission approved, PSE's proposal to modify its earning sharing mechanism to exclude normalizing adjustments that are required for Commission Basis Reporting purposes under Washington Administrative Code 480-90-257 (natural gas) and 480-100-257 (electric).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P116_S1	The Washington Commission rejected PSE s requested electric CRM.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P117_S0	Decoupling Filings While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S0	Since July 2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from most residential, commercial and industrial customers to mitigate the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S1	As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S2	PSE's energy supply costs, which are part of the PCA and PGA mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S3	The revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S4	Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S5	During the rate plan, which ended in December 2017, the allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs increased by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the natural gas customers on January 1.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S6	On December 5, 2017, the Washington Commission approved PSE s request within the 2017 GRC to extend the decoupling mechanism with some changes to the methodology that took effect on December 19, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S7	Electric and natural gas delivery revenues will continue to be recovered on a per customer basis and electric fixed production energy costs will now be decoupled and recovered on a fixed monthly amount basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S8	The allowed decoupling revenue will no longer increase annually on January 1 for electric and natural gas customers and these amounts can only be changed in a GRC, Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC) or ERF filing.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S9	Other changes include regrouping of electric and natural gas non-residential customers and the exclusion of certain electric schedules from the decoupling mechanism going forward.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S10	The rate test which limits the amount of revenues PSE can collect in its annual filings increased from 3.0% to 5.0% for natural gas customers but will remain at 3.0% for electric customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S11	The decoupling mechanism will end on the effective date of PSE s first rate case or other proceeding filed in or after 2021 unless the continuation of the mechanism is approved in either of those proceedings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S12	PSE s decoupling mechanism over and under collections will still be collectible or refundable after this effective date even if the decoupling mechanism is not extended.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S13	There is a 3.0% cap for electric and 5.0% cap for natural gas on annual decoupling increases noted above and the size of decoupling deferral assets on the balance sheet, PSE performed an analysis as of December 31, 2017 to determine if electric and natural gas decoupling revenue deferrals would be collected from customers within 24 months of the annual period, per ASC 980-605.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S14	If not, for GAAP purposes only, PSE will need to record a reserve against the decoupling revenue and regulatory asset balance.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S15	Once the revenue is forecasted to be collected within 24 months, the reserve can be reversed.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P118_S16	The analysis indicated all current deferred revenues for electric and natural gas will be collected within 24 months of the annual period; therefore, there were no adjustments to 2017 decoupling revenues other than to record the previously unrecognized decoupling deferrals of $20.8 million .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Washington Commission issued a GRC order that defined deferrable storm events and provided that costs in excess of the annual cost threshold may be deferred for qualifying storm damage costs that meet the modified IEEE outage criteria for system average interruption duration index.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P119_S1	In 2017 and 2016 , PSE incurred $30.4 million and $22.0 million , respectively, in storm-related electric transmission and distribution system restoration costs, of which $21.6 million was deferred in 2017 and $12.4 million was deferred in 2016 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P119_S2	Under the December 5, 2017 Washington Commission order regarding PSE s GRC, the following changes to PSE s storm deferral mechanism were approved: (i) the cumulative annual cost threshold for deferral of storms under the mechanism increased from $8.0 million to $10.0 million effective January 1, 2018; and (ii) qualifying events where the total qualifying cost is less than $0.5 million will not qualify for deferral and these costs will also not count toward the 10.0 million annual cost threshold.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S0	Washington Commission Tax Deferral Filing The TCJA was signed into law in December of 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S1	As a result of this change, PSE reviewed its deferred tax balances under the new corporate tax rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S2	As PSE is a regulated utility, the impact of tax rate changes on the deferred tax balance is subject to approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S3	Accordingly, PSE filed an accounting petition on December 29, 2017 requesting deferred accounting treatment for the impacts of tax reform.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S4	The deferral accounting treatment results in the tax rate change being captured in the deferred income tax balance with an offset to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P120_S5	The tax rate change for certain deferred tax balances that are not subject to regulatory treatment have been recorded through tax expense.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations by the federal, state and local authorities and is required to undertake certain environmental investigative and remedial efforts as a result of these laws and regulations.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P121_S1	The Company has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Washington State Department of Ecology and/or other third parties as potentially responsible at several contaminated sites and manufactured gas plant sites.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P122_S0	In accordance with the guidance of ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company reviews its estimated future obligations and will record adjustments, if any, on a quarterly basis.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S0	Management believes it is probable and reasonably estimable that the impact of the potential outcomes of disputes with certain property owners and other potentially responsible parties will result in environmental remediation costs of $38.9 million for natural gas and $8.9 million for electric.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S1	The Company believes a significant portion of its past and future environmental remediation costs are recoverable from insurance companies, from third parties or from customers under a Washington Commission order.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S2	The Company is also subject to cost-sharing agreements with third parties regarding environmental remediation projects in Seattle, Washington and Bellingham, Washington.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S3	The Company has taken the lead for both projects, and as of December 31, 2017 , the Company s share of future remediation costs is estimated to be approximately $28.6 million .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S4	The Company's deferred electric environmental costs are $17.6 million , $13.8 million and $14.0 million at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S5	The Company's deferred natural gas environmental costs are $63.9 million , $60.7 million , and $52.9 million at December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively, net of insurance proceeds.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P123_S6	In the GRC which became effective December 19, 2017, the Company had its third party recoveries and remediation costs incurred as of September 30, 2016, net of a portion of insurance, approved for amortization and inclusion in rates.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P124_S0	The payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P124_S1	At December 31, 2017 , approximately $645.1 million of unrestricted retained earnings was available for the payment of dividends under the most restrictive mortgage indenture covenant.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P125_S0	Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE s common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, is 44.0% or below except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P125_S1	Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE may not declare or make any distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or, if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P125_S2	The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 48.0% at December 31, 2017 , and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.5 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P125_S3	PSE s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P125_S4	Puget Energy s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the merger order issued by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P126_S0	EBITDA to consolidated interest expense for the four most recently ended fiscal quarters prior to such date is equal to or greater than 2.0 to 1.0 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P126_S1	Puget Energy's EBITDA to interest expense was 3.7 to 1.0 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P126_S2	At December 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, including those pertaining to the payment of dividends.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P127_S0	The following table presents electric, natural gas and common utility plant classified by account:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P128_S0	Jointly owned generating plant service costs are included in utility plant service cost at the Company's ownership share.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P128_S4	The Company's share of fuel costs and operating expenses for plant in service are included in the corresponding accounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P129_S0	Asset Retirement Obligation The Company has recorded liabilities for steam generation sites, combustion turbine generation sites, wind generation sites, distribution and transmission poles, natural gas mains, and leased facilities where disposal is governed by ASC 410 Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations" (ARO).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P130_S0	On April 17, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The CCR ruling requires the Company to perform an extensive study on the effects of coal ash on the environment and public health.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P130_S1	The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash surface impoundments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P130_S2	The CCR rule and two new legal agreements which include a consent decree with the Sierra Club and a settlement agreement with the Sierra Club and the National Wildlife Federation in 2016 make significant changes to the Company s Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in 2015 and 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P131_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation in 2003 under EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P131_S1	Due to the updated Colstrip information, additional disposal costs were added to the ARO.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P131_S2	On September 6, 2016, PSE entered into two new agreements requiring the Company to close the Colstrip 1 and 2 plants on or before July 1, 2022 and to incur additional monitoring costs, water treatment costs, forced evaporation cost, and post closure care costs for all Colstrip Units.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P131_S3	As a result, in 2016 the Company adjusted the Colstrip ARO ending liability to increase by $45.7 million for Colstrip 1 and 2 and $37.0 million for Colstrip 3 and 4.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S0	The actual ARO costs related to the CCR rule requirements may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation due to uncertainty about the compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S1	We will continue to gather additional data and coordinate with the plant operator to make decisions about compliance strategies and the timing of closure activities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S2	As additional information becomes available, the Company will update the ARO obligation for these changes, which could be material.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S3	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 the Company reviewed the estimated remediation costs at Colstrip and reduced the Colstrip ARO liability by $5.5 million for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 and $12.7 million for Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S4	The Company also recorded the Colstrip relief of liability of $3.8 million .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P132_S5	In addition, the Company recorded a new Tacoma LNG facility ARO liability of $2.7 million for PSE and $2.2 million for Puget LNG as of December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P133_S0	The following table describes the changes to the Company s ARO for the year ended December 31, 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM8_P134_S0	_______________ New asset retirement obligations include $2.2 million ARO for Puget LNG only held at Puget Energy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company has identified the following obligations, as defined by ASC 410, ARO, which were not recognized because the liability for these assets cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2017 due to:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P136_S0	A legal obligation under Federal Dangerous Waste Regulations to dispose of asbestos-containing material in facilities that are not scheduled for remodeling, demolition or sales.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P137_S0	An obligation under Washington state law to decommission the wells at the Jackson Prairie natural gas storage facility upon termination of the project.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P138_S0	An obligation to pay its share of decommissioning costs at the end of the functional life of the major transmission lines.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P139_S0	A legal obligation under Washington state environmental laws to remove and properly dispose of certain under and above ground fuel storage tanks.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P141_S0	A potential legal obligation may arise upon the expiration of an existing FERC hydropower license if FERC orders the project to be decommissioned, although PSE contends that FERC does not have such authority.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P141_S1	Given the value of ongoing generation, flood control and other benefits provided by these projects, PSE believes that the potential for decommissioning is remote and cannot be reasonably estimated.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P142_S0	The following table presents outstanding long-term debt principal amounts and due dates as of 2017 and 2016 :

1085392_18_ITEM8_P146_S0	Substantially all utility properties owned by PSE are subject to the lien of the Company s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P146_S1	To issue additional first mortgage bonds under these indentures, PSE s earnings available for interest must exceed certain minimums as defined in the indentures.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P146_S2	At December 31, 2017 , the earnings available for interest exceeded the required amount.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P157_S1	The agreement also contains a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant as defined in the agreement governing the senior secured credit facility.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P157_S2	As of December 31, 2017 , Puget Energy was in compliance with all applicable covenants.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P158_S0	PSE leases buildings and assets under operating leases.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P158_S1	Certain leases contain purchase options, renewal options and escalation provisions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P158_S2	Payments received for the subleases of properties were immaterial for each of the years ended 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P159_S0	Operating lease expenses net of sublease receipts were:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P160_S0	The following table summarizes the Company s estimated future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable leases net of sublease receipts, through the terms of its existing contracts:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P161_S0	PSE employs various energy portfolio optimization strategies, but is not in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of realizing speculative trading revenue.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P161_S1	The nature of serving regulated electric customers with its portfolio of owned and contracted electric generation resources exposes PSE and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the PCA.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P161_S2	Therefore, wholesale market transactions and PSE's related hedging strategies are focused on reducing costs and risks where feasible, thus reducing volatility in costs in the portfolio.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P162_S0	In order to manage its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy transactions, PSE utilizes a programmatic hedging strategy which extends out three years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P162_S1	In November 2017, PSE implemented a risk-responsive component to its hedging strategy for the core natural gas portfolio.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P162_S2	This strategy utilizes quantitative risk-based measures with defined objectives to balance both portfolio risk and hedge costs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P162_S3	PSE's energy risk portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P162_S4	In order to manage risks effectively, PSE enters into forward physical electric and natural gas purchase and sale agreements, fixed-for-floating swap contracts, and commodity call/put options.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P163_S0	Currently, the Company does not apply cash flow hedge accounting, and therefore records all mark-to-market gains or losses through earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varied maturities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P164_S1	The Company utilizes internal cash from operations, borrowings under its commercial paper program, and its credit facilities to meet short-term funding needs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P164_S2	The Company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P164_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate swap instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following table presents the volumes, fair values and classification of the Company's derivative instruments recorded on the balance sheets:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P166_S0	_______________ Balance sheet classification: Current and Long-term Unrealized gain on derivative instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P166_S1	Balance sheet classification: Current and Long-term Unrealized loss on derivative instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P167_S0	Interest rate swap contracts are only held at Puget Energy and matured in January 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P167_S1	All fair value adjustments on derivatives relating to the natural gas business have been deferred in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations, due to the PGA mechanism.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P168_S0	The net derivative asset or liability and offsetting regulatory liability or asset are related to contracts used to economically hedge the cost of physical gas purchased to serve natural gas customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P169_S0	It is the Company's policy to record all derivative transactions on a gross basis at the contract level without offsetting assets or liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P169_S1	The Company generally enters into transactions using the following master agreements: WSPP, Inc. (WSPP) agreements, which standardize physical power contracts; International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, which standardize financial natural gas and electric contracts; and North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements, which standardize physical natural gas contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P169_S2	The Company believes that such agreements reduce credit risk exposure because such agreements provide for the netting and offsetting of monthly payments as well as the right of set-off in the event of counterparty default.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P170_S0	The set-off provision can be used as a final settlement of accounts which extinguishes the mutual debts owed between the parties in exchange for a new net amount.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P170_S1	For further details regarding the fair value of derivative instruments, see Note 10, "Fair Value Measurements," to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P171_S0	The following tables present the potential effect of netting arrangements, including rights of set-off associated with the Company's derivative assets and liabilities:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P172_S0	_______________ All Derivative Contract deals are executed under ISDA, NAESB and WSPP Master Netting Agreements with Right of set-off.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P172_S1	Interest Rate Swap Contracts are only held at Puget Energy and matured in January 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P173_S0	The following tables present the effect and locations of the realized and unrealized gains (losses) of the Company's derivatives recorded on the statements of income:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P174_S0	_______________ Differences between Puget Energy and PSE for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 are due to certain derivative contracts recorded at fair value in 2009 and subsequently designated as NPNS or cash flow hedges.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P174_S1	These differences occurred through February 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P175_S0	The Company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and natural gas to serve its customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P176_S0	Credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty's non-performance under an agreement.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P176_S1	The Company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for, among other things, counterparty credit analysis, exposure measurement, and exposure monitoring and mitigation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P176_S2	The Company monitors counterparties for significant swings in credit default swap rates, credit rating changes by external rating agencies, ownership changes or financial distress.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P176_S3	Where deemed appropriate, the Company may request collateral or other security from its counterparties to mitigate potential credit default losses.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P176_S4	Criteria employed in this decision include, among other things, the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparty and the expected credit exposure.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P177_S0	It is possible that volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the Company to have material credit risk exposure with one or more counterparties.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P177_S1	If such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements, the Company could suffer a material financial loss.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P177_S2	However, as of December 31, 2017 , approximately 99.5% of the Company's energy portfolio exposure, excluding normal purchase normal sale (NPNS) transactions, is with counterparties that are rated investment grade by rating agencies and 0.5% are either rated below investment grade or not rated by rating agencies.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P178_S0	The Company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated by the major rating agencies.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P178_S1	The Company computes credit reserves at a master agreement level by counterparty.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P178_S2	The Company considers external credit ratings and market factors, such as credit default swaps and bond spreads, in the determination of reserves.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P179_S0	that external ratings may not always reflect how a market participant perceives a counterparty's risk of default.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P179_S1	The Company uses both default factors published by Standard Poor's and factors derived through analysis of market risk, which reflect the application of an industry standard recovery rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P180_S0	The Company selects a default factor by counterparty at an aggregate master agreement level based on a weighted average default tenor for that counterparty's deals.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P180_S1	The default tenor is determined by weighting the fair value and contract tenors for all deals for each counterparty to derive an average value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P180_S2	The default factor used is dependent upon whether the counterparty is in a net asset or a net liability position after applying the master agreement levels.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company applies the counterparty's default factor to compute credit reserves for counterparties that are in a net asset position.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P181_S1	The Company calculates a non-performance risk on its derivative liabilities by using its estimated incremental borrowing rate over the risk-free rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P182_S0	Credit reserves are netted against unrealized gain (loss) positions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P182_S1	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company was in a net liability position with the majority of counterparties, so the default factors of counterparties did not have a significant impact on reserves for the period.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S0	The majority of the Company's derivative contracts are with financial institutions and other utilities operating within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S1	In March 2017, PSE began transacting power futures contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) platform.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S2	Execution of these contracts on ICE requires the daily posting of margin calls as collateral through a futures and clearing agent.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S3	As of December 31, 2017 , PSE had cash posted as collateral of $2.6 million related to contracts executed on this platform.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S4	Also, as of December 31, 2017 , PSE has a $1.0 million letter of credit posted as collateral as a condition of transacting on a physical energy exchange and clearinghouse in Canada.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P183_S5	PSE did not trigger any collateral requirements with any of its counterparties during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 , nor were any of PSE's counterparties required to post collateral resulting from credit rating downgrades.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P184_S0	The following table presents the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a liability position and the amount of additional collateral the Company could be required to post:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P185_S0	_______________ Represents the derivative fair value of contracts with contingent features for counterparties in net derivative liability positions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P185_S1	Excludes NPNS, accounts payable and accounts receivable.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P186_S0	Failure by PSE to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies provides counterparties a contractual right to demand collateral.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P186_S1	Collateral requirements may vary, based on changes in the forward value of underlying transactions relative to contractually defined collateral thresholds.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P187_S0	ASC 820 established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P187_S1	The hierarchy categorizes the inputs into three levels with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P187_S2	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P188_S0	Level 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P188_S1	Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange-traded derivatives and listed equities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P188_S2	Equity securities that are also classified as cash equivalents are considered Level 1 if there are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P189_S0	Level 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P190_S0	Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P190_S1	Instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as over-the-counter forwards and options.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P191_S0	Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that have little or no observability as of the reporting date.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P191_S1	These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P192_S0	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety in the appropriate fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P192_S1	The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company primarily determines fair value measurements classified as Level 2 or Level 3 using a combination of the income and market valuation approaches.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P193_S1	The process of determining the fair values is the responsibility of the derivative accounting department which reports to the Controller and Principal Accounting Officer.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P193_S2	Inputs used to estimate the fair value of forwards, swaps and options include market-price curves, contract terms and prices, credit-risk adjustments, and discount factors.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P193_S3	Additionally, for options, the Black-Scholes option valuation model and implied market volatility curves are used.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P194_S0	Inputs used to estimate fair value in industry-standard models are categorized as Level 2 inputs as substantially all assumptions and inputs are observable in active markets throughout the full term of the instruments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P195_S0	On a daily basis, the Company obtains quoted forward prices for the electric and natural gas markets from an independent external pricing service.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P195_S1	The Company considers its electric and natural gas contracts as Level 2 derivative instruments as such contracts are commonly traded as over-the-counter forwards with indirectly observable price quotes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P195_S2	However, certain energy derivative instruments with maturity dates falling outside the range of observable price quotes are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P196_S0	Management's assessment is based on the trading activity in real-time and forward electric and natural gas markets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P197_S0	Each quarter, the Company confirms the validity of pricing-service quoted prices used to value Level 2 commodity contracts with the actual prices of commodity contracts entered into during the most recent quarter.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P198_S0	The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term debt as reported on the balance sheet are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P198_S1	The carrying value of other investments of $48.5 million and $49.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, are included in "Other property and investments" on the balance sheet.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P198_S2	These values are also reasonable estimates of their fair value and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued based on market rates for similar transactions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P198_S3	The fair value of the junior subordinated and long-term notes were estimated using the discounted cash flow method with U.S. Treasury yields and Company's credit spreads as inputs, interpolating to the maturity date of each issue.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P198_S4	The carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P199_S0	The following tables present the Company's financial assets and liabilities by level, within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the reconciliation of the changes in the fair value of Level 3 derivatives in the fair value hierarchy:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P200_S0	_______________ Interest rate derivative instruments are only held at Puget Energy, and matured January 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P201_S0	_______________ Income Statement classification: Unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments, net.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P201_S1	Includes unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives still held in position as of the reporting date for electric derivatives of $1.5 million , $2.0 million and $(7.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Company had no purchases, sales or issuances during the reported periods.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P202_S0	Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in energy costs in the Company's consolidated statements of income under purchased electricity, electric generation fuel or purchased natural gas when settled.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P202_S1	Unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives for Level 3 recurring items are included in net unrealized (gain) loss on derivative instruments in the Company's consolidated statements of income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P203_S0	In order to determine which assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3, the Company receives market data from its independent external pricing service defining the tenor of observable market quotes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P203_S1	To the extent any of the Company's commodity contracts extend beyond what is considered observable as defined by its independent pricing service, the contracts are classified as Level 3.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P204_S0	The actual tenor of what the independent pricing service defines as observable is subject to change depending on market conditions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P204_S1	Therefore, as the market changes, the same contract may be designated Level 3 one month and Level 2 the next, and vice versa.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P204_S2	The changes of fair value classification into or out of Level 3 are recognized each month, and reported in the Level 3 Roll-forward table above.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P204_S3	The Company did not have any transfers between Level 2 and Level 1 during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P205_S0	The Company does periodically transact at locations, or market price points, that are illiquid or for which no prices are available from the independent pricing service.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P205_S1	In such circumstances the Company uses a more liquid price point and performs a 15-month regression against the illiquid locations to serve as a proxy for market prices.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P205_S2	Such transactions are classified as Level 3.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P206_S0	The Company does not use internally developed models to make adjustments to significant unobservable pricing inputs.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P206_S1	The only significant unobservable input into the fair value measurement of the Company's Level 3 assets and liabilities is the forward price for electric and natural gas contracts.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P206_S2	Below are the forward price ranges for the Company's commodity contracts, as of December 31, 2017 :
1085392_18_ITEM8_P207_S0	The valuation techniques, unobservable inputs and ranges are the same for asset and liability positions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P208_S0	The significant unobservable inputs listed above would have a direct impact on the fair values of the above instruments if they were adjusted.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P208_S1	Consequently, significant increases or decreases in the forward prices of electricity or natural gas in isolation would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value for Level 3 assets and liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P209_S0	Generally, interrelationships exist between market prices of natural gas and power.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P209_S1	As such, an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have a similar impact on forward power markets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P209_S2	At December 31, 2017 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in market prices of natural gas and electricity would change the fair value of the Company's derivative portfolio, classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, by $0.9 million .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P210_S0	Puget Energy records the fair value of its intangible assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, (ASC 360).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P210_S1	The fair value assigned to the power contracts was determined using an income approach comparing the contract rate to the market rate for power over the remaining period of the contracts incorporating non-performance risk.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P210_S2	Management also incorporated certain assumptions related to quantities and market presentation that it believes market participants would make in the valuation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P211_S0	The fair value of the power contracts is amortized as the contracts settle.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P212_S0	ASC 360 requires long-lived assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and upon the occurrence of any events or circumstances that would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the long-lived assets below their carrying value.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P212_S1	One such triggering event is a significant decrease in the forward market prices of power.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P213_S0	During 2017 and 2016 , Puget Energy completed valuation and impairment testing of its power purchase contracts classified as intangible assets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P213_S1	In 2017 and 2016 , due to continued decreases in forward power prices and decreases in forecasted revenue and cost estimates, the following impairments were recorded to the Company's intangible asset contracts, with corresponding reductions to the regulatory liability as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P214_S0	The valuations were measured using a discounted cash flow, income-based valuation methodology.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P214_S1	Significant inputs included forward electricity prices and power contract pricing which provided future net cash flow estimates classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P214_S2	A less significant input is the discount rate reflective of PSE's cost of capital used in the valuation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P214_S3	Below are significant unobservable inputs used in estimating the impaired long term power purchase contracts' fair value in 2017 and 2016 :
1085392_18_ITEM8_P215_S0	The Company's Investment Plan is a qualified employee 401(k) plan, under which employee salary deferrals and after-tax contributions are used to purchase several different investment fund options.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P215_S1	PSE s contributions to the employee Investment Plan were $19.2 million , $17.2 million and $16.1 million for the years 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P216_S0	The employee Investment Plan eligibility requirements are set forth in the plan documents.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P216_S1	Non-represented employees and United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry (UA) represented employees hired before January 1, 2014, and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 77 (IBEW) represented employees hired before December 12, 2014, have the following company contributions:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	For employees under the Cash Balance retirement plan formula, PSE will match 100% of an employee's contribution up to 6.0% of plan compensation each paycheck, and will make an additional year-end contribution equal to 1.0% of base pay.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	For employees grandfathered under the Final Average Earning retirement plan formula, PSE will match 55.0% of an employee s contribution up to 6.0% of plan compensation each paycheck.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P218_S1	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 along with IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014, will have access to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P218_S2	The two contribution sources from PSE are below:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	401(k) Company Matching: New non-represented, UA-represented and IBEW-represented employees will receive company match each paycheck based on a new schedule: 100% match on the first 3.0% of pay contributed and 50.0% match on the next 3.0% of pay contributed.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P219_S1	An employee who contributes 6.0% of pay will receive 4.5% of pay in company match.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P219_S2	Company matching will be immediately vested.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P228_S0	Assumptions In accounting for pension and other benefit obligations and costs under the plans, the following weighted-average actuarial assumptions were used by the Company:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P229_S0	The assumed medical inflation rate used to determine benefit obligations is 6.80% in 2018 grading down to 4.10% in 2019 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P229_S1	A 1.0% change in the assumed medical inflation rate would have the following effects:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P230_S0	The Company has selected the expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the Company s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P230_S1	The expected rate of return is reviewed annually based on these factors.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P231_S0	The Company s accounting policy for calculating the market-related value of assets for the Company s retirement plan is based on a five-year smoothing of asset gains (losses) measured from the expected return on market-related assets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P231_S1	This is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P231_S2	The same manner of calculating market-related value is used for all classes of assets, and is applied consistently from year to year.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P232_S0	Puget Energy s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs depend on several factors and assumptions, including plan design, timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan, earnings on plan assets, discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality and health care costs trends.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P232_S1	Changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that Puget Energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P233_S0	Puget Energy has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and Puget Energy s investment mix, market conditions, inflation and other factors.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P233_S1	As required by merger accounting rules, market-related value was reset to market value effective with the merger.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P233_S2	The discount rates were determined by using market interest rate data and the weighted-average discount rate from Citigroup Pension Liability Index Curve.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P233_S3	The Company also takes into account in determining the discount rate the expected changes in market interest rates and anticipated changes in the duration of the plan liabilities.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	The expected total benefits to be paid during the next five years and the aggregate total to be paid for the five years thereafter are as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	Plan Assets Plan contributions and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are prepared based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all of which are subject to change.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P235_S1	Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions process, changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near term may be material to the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Company has a Retirement Plan Committee that establishes investment policies, objectives and strategies designed to balance expected return with a prudent level of risk.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P236_S1	All changes to the investment policies are reviewed and approved by the Retirement Plan Committee prior to being implemented.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P237_S0	The Retirement Plan Committee invests trust assets with investment managers who have historically achieved above-median long-term investment performance within the risk and asset allocation limits that have been established.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P239_S1	The objectives of the disclosures are to disclose the following: (i) how investment allocation decisions are made, including the factors that are pertinent to an understanding of investment policies and strategies; (ii) major categories of plan assets; (iii) inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets; (iv) effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on changes in plan assets for the period; and (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P240_S0	ASC 820 allows the reporting entity, as a practical expedient, to measure the fair value of investments that do not have readily determinable fair values on the basis of the net asset value per share of the investment if the net asset value of the investment is calculated in a matter consistent with ASC 946, Financial Services Investment Companies .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P240_S1	The standard requires disclosures about the nature and risk of the investments and whether the investments are probable of being sold at amounts different from the net asset value per share.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P240_S2	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the qualified pension plan as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 :
1085392_18_ITEM8_P241_S0	_______________ In accordance with ASU 2015-07, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)", certain investments that were measured at NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P241_S1	The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the statement of net assets available for benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P242_S0	Investments measured at NAV primarily consist of common/collective trust funds and two partnerships held as of December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P243_S0	Mesirow Institutional Multi-Strategy Fund Partnership, L.P. utilizes a combination of long and short strategies through investments in investment funds.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P243_S1	The major strategy allocations of the investment funds include (1) Investments in debt obligations of public and private entities; typically, in financial duress, and (2) Investments in equity positions on a global basis utilizing fundamental analysis.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P244_S1	In addition to the Master Fund, investments are made primarily in offshore investment funds, investment partnerships, and pooled investment vehicles; collectively referred to as Portfolio Funds, which generally implement "nontraditional" or "alternative" investment strategies.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P245_S0	The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Other Benefits plan assets which consist of insurance benefits for retired employees, at fair value:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P246_S0	_______________ This is a publicly traded balanced mutual fund.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P246_S1	The fund seeks regular income, conservation of principal, and an opportunity for long-term growth of principal and income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P246_S2	The fair value is determined by taking the number of shares owned by the plan, and multiplying by the market price as of December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P247_S0	In accordance with ASU 2015-07, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)", certain investments that were measured at NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P251_S0	_______________ PSE's Wild Horse wind plant and Hopkins Ridge wind plant earned their last PTCs in December 2016 and 2015, respectively.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P252_S0	The Company s net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is composed of amounts related to the following types of temporary differences:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P253_S0	On December 22, 2017 , President Trump signed into law legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P253_S1	Substantially all of the provisions of the TCJA are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P254_S0	The TCJA includes significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the Code), including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities including PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P254_S1	The most significant change that impacts the Company included in the TCJA is the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35.0% percent to 21.0% percent.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P254_S2	The specific provisions related to regulated public utilities in the TCJA generally allow for the continued deductibility of interest expense, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017 and continues normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P254_S3	For Puget Energy, TCJA provides for full expensing of property acquired after September 27, 2017 and limits a deduction for interest expense to 30.0% percent of adjusted taxable income (which resembles earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA ).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S0	Under generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) specifically ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted and deferred tax assets and liabilities are to be re-measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S1	For PSE, the change in deferred taxes is recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and is subject to approval by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S2	For Puget Energy, the change in deferred taxes is recorded as an adjustment to Puget Energy s income tax expense, which decreased Puget Energy s net income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S3	Upon, enactment of the TCJA, the Company re-measured their deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the TCJA s 21.0% percent corporate federal income tax rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S4	The corporate tax rate change for PSE is captured in the deferred tax balance with an offset to the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S5	The balance of the regulatory deferred tax account at the beginning of the year, before tax reform, was a $71.5 million asset.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S6	As a result of tax reform, the balance is a liability of $1,012.3 million which represents the excess deferred taxes that will eventually be refunded to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P255_S7	Since, PSE is in a net regulatory liability position with respect to these income tax matters, PSE netted the regulatory asset for deferred income taxes against the regulatory liability for deferred income taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P256_S0	Under the normalization requirements continued by the TCJA, $919.8 million of the net regulatory liability related to certain accelerated tax depreciation benefits is to be amortized over the remaining lives of the related assets.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P256_S1	The remainder of the net regulatory liability of $92.5 million is available for PSE and the Washington Commission regulatory process to determine how the amounts will be refunded to customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P257_S0	PSE requested to delay the impact of tax reform in an accounting petition which was filed with the Washington Commission on December 29, 2017 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P257_S1	The income statement impact for the regulatory deferred tax will come in the future when the Washington Commission issues a final order.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P257_S2	The timing for that is unknown but will likely occur in 2018.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S0	The impact of the TCJA to income tax expense was $36.3 million of which $3.0 million relates to deferred tax balances that are not subject to regulatory treatment.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S1	In addition, $33.3 million relates to the revaluation of the PTC deferred taxes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S2	The liability owed to customers for PTCs, which previously reduced revenue upon generation of the PTCs, was also revalued at the TCJAs 21 percent rate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S3	The change in the liability owed to customers for PTCs due to TCJA increased revenue by $51.2 million , which increased tax expense by $17.9 million , to reverse the initial deferral.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S4	The changes in deferred tax and liability owed to customers for PTCs had no impact on net income.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P258_S5	Incrementally, Puget Energy increased their tax expense by $80.9 million primarily due to the revaluation of Puget Energy's net deferred tax asset on its net operating loss carryforward.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S0	income taxes under ASC 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting (the measurement period).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S1	SAB 118 describes three scenarios (or buckets ) associated with a company s status of accounting for income tax reform: (1) a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform, (2) a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount, or (3) a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply ASC 740, based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the TCJA being enacted.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S2	The Company has completed the required analysis and accounting for substantially all the effects of the TCJA's enactment and have made a reasonable estimate as to the other effects, and have reflected the measurement and accounting of the effects in the 2017 consolidated financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S3	The items reflected as provisional amounts include tax depreciation and amortization and other book to tax differences.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S4	PSE has accounted for these items based on its interpretation of the TCJA.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S5	Further interpretive guidance on the TCJA from the IRS, U.S. Treasury Department, or the Joint Committee on Taxation may require adjustments to PSE's accounting.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P259_S6	In accordance with SAB 118, adjustments, if any, will be recorded in 2018 .
1085392_18_ITEM8_P260_S0	The Company did not identify any effects on the TCJA for which they were not able to either complete the required analysis or make a reasonable estimate.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S0	The Company calculates its deferred tax assets and liabilities under ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740).
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S1	ASC 740 requires recording deferred tax balances, at the currently enacted tax rate, on assets and liabilities that are reported differently for income tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S2	The utilization of deferred tax assets requires sufficient taxable income in future years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S3	ASC 740 requires a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S4	The Company s PTC carryforwards expire from 2027 through 2037.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S5	The Company s net operating loss carryforwards expire from 2029 through 2036.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P261_S6	No valuation allowance has been provided for PTC or net operating loss carryforwards.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P262_S0	The Company accounts for uncertain tax position under ASC 740, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P262_S1	ASC 740 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P263_S0	First, a tax position should only be recognized when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon challenge by the taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P263_S1	Second, a tax position that meets the recognition threshold should be measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50.0% likelihood of being sustained.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P264_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P264_S1	As a result, no interest or penalties were accrued for unrecognized tax benefits during the year.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P264_S2	The Company has open tax years from 2014 through 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P264_S3	The Company classifies interest as interest expense and penalties as other expense in the financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P265_S0	From time to time, the Company is involved in litigation or legislative rulemaking proceedings relating to its operations in the normal course of business.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P266_S0	Colstrip PSE has a 50% ownership interest in Colstrip Units 1 and 2, and a 25% interest in Colstrip Units 3 and 4.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P267_S0	On March 6, 2013, the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center filed a Clean Air Act citizen suit against all Colstrip owners in the U.S. District Court, District of Montana.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P267_S1	On July 12, 2016, PSE reached a settlement with the Sierra Club to dismiss all of the Clean Air Act allegations against the Colstrip Generating Station, which was approved by the court on September 6, 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P267_S2	As part of the settlement that was signed by all Colstrip owners, Colstrip 1 and 2 owners, PSE and Talen Energy, agreed to retire the two oldest units (Units 1 and 2) at Colstrip in eastern Montana by no later than July 1, 2022.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S0	The Washington Commission allows full recovery in rates of the net book value (NBV) at retirement and related decommissioning costs consistent with prior precedents.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S1	As a result, PSE reclassified $176.8 million from a utility plant asset to a regulatory asset, which represents the expected NBV at retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 2, based on the expected shutdown date of July 1, 2022 as of December 31, 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S2	Depreciation rates were updated in the GRC effective December 19, 2017, where PSE's depreciation increased for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 to recover plant costs to the expected shutdown date.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S3	The increase in depreciation caused the Colstrip Units 1 and 2 regulatory asset to be reduced to $127.6 million as of December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S4	The GRC also repurposed PTCs and hydro-related treasury grants to fund and recover decommissioning and remediation costs for Colstrip Units 1 and 2.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P268_S5	Colstrip Units 3 and 4, which are newer and more efficient, are not affected by the settlement, and allegations in the lawsuit against Colstrip Units 3 and 4 were dismissed as part of the settlement with the Sierra Club.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P269_S0	While PSE has estimated the ARO for Colstrip Units 1 and 2, the full scope of decommissioning activities and costs may vary from the estimates that are available at this time.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P270_S0	Greenwood On March 9, 2016, a natural gas explosion occurred in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle, WA, damaging multiple structures.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P270_S1	The Washington Commission Staff completed its investigation of the incident and filed a complaint on September 20, 2016, seeking up to $3.2 million in fines from PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P270_S2	As of September 30, 2016, PSE accrued $3.2 million for the fine.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P270_S7	However, litigation is still pending regarding damage and personal injury claims.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P271_S0	Coal Combustion Residuals On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates CCR's under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P271_S1	The EPA issued another rule, effective October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines under the CCR rule.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P272_S0	The CCR rule is self-implementing at a federal level or can be taken over by a state.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P273_S0	The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P273_S1	The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P273_S2	The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P274_S0	PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P275_S0	Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the ARO.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S0	In June 2014, the EPA issued a proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act designed to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S1	The proposed rule includes state-specific goals and guidelines for states to develop plans for meeting these goals.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S2	The EPA published a final rule on October 23, 2015.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S3	The rule was being challenged by other states and parties, and the Supreme Court granted a stay of the rule on February 9, 2016 until the litigation is resolved.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S4	On March 31, 2017, the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, signed a notice of withdrawal of the proposed CPP federal plan and model trading rules and, on October 10, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP rule and is currently accepting comment on the proposal.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P276_S5	PSE is still reviewing the impact of these developments.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P277_S0	Washington Clean Air Rule The CAR was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities located within Washington State.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P277_S1	Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P278_S0	The CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time, approximately 5.0% every three years.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P278_S1	Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P279_S0	The CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P279_S1	The CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S0	On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging the CAR.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S1	On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to the CAR in Thurston County Superior Court.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S2	On December 15, 2017, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S3	A final court order is pending and in the meantime, the Washington State Department of Ecology (WDOE), submitted a brief requesting severability, which would make the rule valid for industries with direct emissions.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S4	This would apply to The Company's electric utility thermal generation units but not to its natural gas utility.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P280_S5	Appeals could be filed to the Thurston County Court of Appeals after the court's final order, including its ruling on severability.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P281_S0	Other Proceedings The Company is also involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business.

1085392_18_ITEM8_P282_S1	The purchase of power from the Columbia River projects is on a pro rata share basis under which the Company pays a proportionate share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project, in proportion to the contractual share of power that PSE obtains from that project.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P282_S2	In these instances, PSE s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable; therefore, PSE is required to make the payments even if power is not delivered.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P282_S3	These projects are financed through substantially debt service payments and their annual costs should not vary significantly over the term of the contracts unless additional financing is required to meet the costs of major maintenance, repairs or replacements, or license requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P282_S4	The Company s share of the costs and the output of the projects is subject to reduction due to various withdrawal rights of the PUDs and others over the contract lives.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P282_S5	The Company's expenses under these PUD contracts were as follows for the years ended December 31:
1085392_18_ITEM8_P283_S0	As of December 31, 2017 , the Company purchased portions of the power output of the PUDs' projects as set forth in the following table:

1085392_18_ITEM8_P286_S1	The Company contracts for its long-term natural gas supply on a firm basis, which means the Company has a 100% daily take obligation and the supplier has a 100% daily delivery obligation to ensure service to PSE s customers and generation requirements.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P286_S2	The transportation and storage contracts, which have remaining terms from 1 year to 27 years, provide that the Company must pay a fixed demand charge each month, regardless of actual usage.
1085392_18_ITEM8_P286_S3	The Company incurred demand charges for 2017 for firm transportation, storage and peaking services for its natural gas customers of $121.4 million .

1085392_18_ITEM11_P1_S0	Compensation Discussion and Analysis This section provides information about the compensation program for the Company s Named Executive Officers who are included in the Summary Compensation Table below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P1_S1	For 2017 the Company s Named Executive Officers and titles were:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P2_S0	This section also includes a discussion and analysis of the overall objectives of our compensation program and each element of compensation the Company provides.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P3_S0	Compensation Program Objectives The Company s executive compensation program has two main objectives: Support sustained Company performance by attracting, retaining and motivating talented people to run the business.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P3_S1	Align incentive compensation payments with the achievement of short and long-term Company goals.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P4_S0	The Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring an executive compensation program and philosophy that achieves the foregoing objectives.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P4_S1	In performing its duties, the Committee obtains information and advice on various aspects of the executive compensation program from its independent executive compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook Co., Inc. (FW Cook).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P4_S2	The Committee recommends to the full Board for approval both the salary level for our CEO, based on information provided by FW Cook, and the salary levels for the other executives, based on recommendations from our CEO.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P4_S3	The Committee also recommends to the Board for its approval the annual and long-term incentive compensation plans for the executives, the setting of performance goals and the determination of target and actual awards under those plans, based on the compensation philosophy and taking into consideration information provided by FW Cook.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P5_S0	In 2017, the Committee used the following strategies to achieve the objectives of our executive compensation program:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P6_S0	Design and deliver a competitive total compensation opportunity.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P6_S1	To attract, retain and motivate a talented executive team, the Committee believes that total pay opportunity should be competitive with companies of similar size and scope of operations so that new executives will want to join the Company and current executives will be retained.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P6_S2	As described below in the discussion of Compensation Program Elements (Review of Pay Element Competitiveness), the Committee annually compares executive compensation levels to external market data from similar companies in our industry and targets each element of target total direct compensation (the sum of base salary and target annual and long-term incentive award opportunities) to the 50th percentile of the market data with variations by individual executive, as appropriate.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P6_S3	The Committee also recognizes the importance of providing retirement income.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P6_S4	Executives choose to work for the Company as opposed to a variety of other alternative organizations, and one financial goal of employees is to provide a secure future for themselves and their families.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P7_S0	The Committee reviews the design of retirement programs provided by our comparator group and provides benefits that are commensurate with this group.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P8_S0	Place a significant portion of each executive s target total compensation at risk to align executive compensation with Company financial and operating performance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P9_S0	Under its pay for performance philosophy, the Committee works to design and deliver an incentive compensation program that supports the Company s business strategy as approved by the Board and aligns executive interests with those of investors and customers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P9_S1	The Committee believes that a significant portion of each executive s compensation should be at risk and earned based on achievement relative to annual and long-term performance goals.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P9_S2	By establishing goals, monitoring results, and rewarding achievement of goals, the Company focuses executives on actions that will improve the Company and enhance investor value, while also retaining key talent.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P10_S0	The Committee annually evaluates the performance factors and targets for our annual and long-term incentive programs and considers adjustments as appropriate to meet the objectives of our executive compensation program.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P11_S0	As described under Risk Assessment, the Company s policies and practices surrounding incentive pay are structured in a manner to mitigate the risk that employees would seek to take untoward risks in an attempt to increase incentive program results.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P12_S0	Oversee the Company s talent management process to ensure that executive leadership continues uninterrupted by executive retirements or other personnel changes.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P12_S1	The CEO leads talent reviews for leadership succession planning through meetings and discussions with her executive team.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P12_S2	Each executive conducts talent reviews of senior employees that report to him or her and who have high potential for assuming greater responsibility in the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P12_S3	Utilizing evaluations and assessments, the Committee and the Board annually review these assessments of executive readiness, the plans for development of the Company s key executives, and progress made on these succession plans.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P12_S4	The Committee and the Board directly participate in discussion of succession plans for the position of CEO.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P13_S0	Compensation Program Elements The Company s compensation program encompasses a mix of base salary, annual and long-term incentive compensation, retirement programs, health and welfare benefits and a limited number of perquisites.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S0	termination and change in control benefits to executives who were employed by the Company prior to March 2009.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S1	Since the Company is not publicly listed and does not grant equity awards to its executives, it relies on a mix of fixed and variable cash-based compensation elements to achieve its compensation objectives.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S2	The target total compensation package is designed to provide participants with appropriate incentives that are competitive with the comparator group described below and drive the achievement of current operational performance and customer service goals as well as the long-term objective of enhancing investor value.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S3	The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the mix of compensation elements, although long-term incentive awards comprise the largest portion of each executive s incentive pay.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S4	The Company arrives at a mix of pay by setting each compensation element relative to market comparators.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P14_S5	The Company delivered cash compensation to the Named Executive Officers in 2017 through base salary to provide liquidity for the executives and through incentive programs to focus performance on important Company goals and to increase the alignment with investors.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P15_S0	Review of Pay Element Competitiveness To help inform the Committee s recommendations for 2017 base salaries, target annual incentives and target long-term incentive awards, the Committee reviewed market data obtained from both industry-specific surveys and proxy statements of public companies selected for inclusion in the Company s custom executive compensation benchmarking peer group.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P15_S1	The market survey data were sourced from a select cut from the Towers Watson 2016 Energy Services Survey, comprised of utility and other companies similar in size and scope of operations to PSE.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P15_S2	The 23 companies in the custom market survey cut used to inform target compensation decisions for 2017 were:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P16_S0	As noted, the market survey data were supplemented with proxy statement data for select positions in the Company s executive compensation peer group, which was comprised of 16 companies, all but three of which overlapped with companies included in the market survey data.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P16_S1	The 2016 median revenue of the executive compensation peers was $3.4 billion, which was comparable to PSE s annual revenues of $3.1 billion at the time the peer group was developed.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P16_S2	The peer companies included in the Company s executive compensation benchmarking peer group to inform 2017 compensation decisions are shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P17_S0	As a matter of philosophy, all three components of target total direct compensation are generally targeted at the 50th percentile of industry practice, with deviations by individual executive as described below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P17_S1	If Company performance results are below expectations, actual compensation is expected to be below this targeted level and if Company performance exceeds target, actual compensation is expected to be above this targeted level.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P18_S0	Individual pay adjustments are reviewed annually to see how they position the executive in relation to the 50th percentile of market pay, while also considering the executive s recent performance and experience level.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P19_S0	differ from those typically found in the market.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P19_S1	In addition to the foregoing market data, the Committee generally also received advice from FW Cook in connection with 2017 compensation decisions.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P20_S0	Base Salary We recognize that it is necessary to provide executives with a fixed amount of compensation that is delivered each month and provides a balance to other pay elements that are at risk.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P21_S0	As mentioned above, base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee based on its median philosophy, internal equity considerations and individual executive considerations such as expertise, level of performance achievement, experience in role and contribution relative to others in the organization.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S0	Base Salary Adjustments for 2017 The Committee reviewed the base salaries of the Named Executive Officers in early 2017 and recommended base salary adjustments to the Board.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S1	The Board approved the Committee s recommendation to increase executive salaries as shown in the table below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S2	The adjustments were effective March 1, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S3	Base salaries for 2017 generally remained at the 50th percentile of market among the comparator group.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S4	The annual salary for Ms. Harris is unchanged from 2016, given that her current base salary was slightly higher than the market median.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P22_S5	The salary increase percentages approved by the Board for the other Named Executive Officers were approximately 3%, similar to salary increases for other non-represented employees, except for Mr. Doyle who did not receive an increase and Mr. Secrist who received an additional adjustment to better align with the market levels.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P23_S0	2017 Annual Incentive Compensation All PSE employees, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in an annual incentive program referred to as the Goals and Incentive Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P23_S1	The plan is designed to provide financial incentives for achieving desired annual operating results, measured by EBITDA, while also meeting the Company s service quality commitment to customers and an employee safety measure.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P24_S0	EBITDA was selected as a performance goal because it provides a financial measure of cash flows generated from the Company s annual operating performance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P25_S0	For 2017, the Company s service quality commitment was measured by performance against nine Service Quality Indicators (SQIs) covering three broad categories, set forth below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P25_S1	These are the same SQIs for which the Company is accountable to the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P25_S2	Annual incentive funding is decreased if a SQI is not achieved.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P26_S0	The Company's annual report to the Washington Commission and our customers describes each SQI, how it is measured, the Company s required level of achievement, and performance results.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P26_S1	The Company s service quality report cards are available at http://www.PSE.com/PerformanceReportCards.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P26_S2	The SQIs for 2017 were the same as those in 2016 and were as follows:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P27_S0	Customer Satisfaction (3 SQIs) - Customer satisfaction with the telephone access center and natural gas field services and number of Washington Commission complaints.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P27_S1	Customer Service (2 SQIs) - Calls answered live and on-time appointments.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P28_S0	Safety and Reliability (4 SQIs) - Gas emergency response, electric emergency response, non-storm outage frequency and non-storm outage duration.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P29_S0	In 2017, the Company retained a safety performance measure in the annual incentive plan funding to promote its continued commitment to employee safety.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P29_S1	The employee safety measure functions similarly to the nine SQIs in determining the funding of the annual incentive plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P29_S2	That is, if the safety measure is not achieved, annual incentive funding will be decreased by 10%, in the same way as a missed SQI.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P30_S0	The safety performance measure contains three targets which must all be satisfied for the safety measure to be treated as met.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P30_S1	The three targets for 2017 were:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P31_S0	All employees attend a monthly safety meeting in a box presentation, or complete the same content online.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P31_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95%.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P32_S0	The Company DART ( D ays A way from Work, days of R estricted Work, or Job T ransfer) not to exceed a rate of 0.52 in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P33_S0	All employees complete an online defensive driving training.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P33_S1	The target completion rate is no less than 95%.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P34_S0	In 2017, 100% funding for the annual incentive plan required (i) achievement of 10 out of 10 customer service and safety measures (all nine SQIs and achievement of the safety measure) and (ii) target EBITDA performance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P34_S1	The safety measure and eight out of nine SQI measures were met for 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P34_S2	For the one SQI measure below the WUTC target, System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), the Board considered the measure met for incentive purposes based on PSE's performance and recent changes in the measure by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P34_S3	For 2018 and future years, Company performance on SAIDI will continue to be measured as part of the annual incentive plan, based on performance targets approved by the Board and will function as one of the 10 measures.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P34_S4	All 10 customer service and safety measures were met or deemed met.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P35_S0	Funding levels for 2017 at maximum, target, and threshold are shown in the table below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P36_S0	The Committee can adjust EBITDA used in the annual incentive calculation to exclude nonrecurring items that are outside the normal course of business for the year, but made no adjustments.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P37_S0	Individual awards may be adjusted upward or downward based on an evaluation of an executive officer s performance against individual and team goals that align with the corporate goals described below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P38_S0	2017 Corporate Goals In 2017, the Company continued using the Integrated Strategic Plan (ISP) to summarize for employees the direction and overall goals of the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P38_S1	The plan has five objectives which capture our 2017 corporate goals and which have been communicated to our employees.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P38_S2	Each employee, including the Named Executive Officers, has specific individual and team goals linked to driving strategies that meet one or more of the following ISP objectives:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P39_S0	Safety - Our Safety Objective is our foundation: If Nobody Gets Hurt Today, we will feel safe and secure and be able to perform at our best.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P40_S0	People - When we re Safe, we can achieve our People Objective of being a Great Place to Work, with engaged employees who live our values, embrace an ownership culture and are motivated to drive results for our company and our customers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P41_S0	Process and Tools - Engaged employees take us to our Process and Tools Objective where results start with achieving Operational Excellence, with continuous improvement of our internal processes and tools so that we can increase efficiency, eliminate waste, improve reliability and enhance customer service.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P42_S0	Customer - We now have the fundamentals to achieve our Customer Objective of delivering greater value and being our Customer s Energy Partner of Choice in a competitive marketplace.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P43_S0	Financial - Being our customer s energy partner of choice takes us to our Financial Objective of increasing our Financial Strength, allowing us to sustain further improvement.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P44_S0	2017 Annual Incentive Plan Results Achievement of the corporate goals for 2017 was at 102.6% of target for EBITDA, and deemed fully met for SQI and safety achievement.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P44_S1	PSE EBITDA was $1,318.3 million, and SQI and safety achievement was 10 out of 10, leading to a funding level for 2017 of 113.2% for the annual incentive plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P45_S0	For 2017, individual target incentive levels for the annual incentive plan varied by executive officer as a percentage of 2017 base salary as shown in the table below, based on the executive s level of responsibility within the Company and informed by market data.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P46_S0	from 2016 levels, except for Mr. Doyle's target which was increased to 55% of base salary.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P46_S1	The maximum incentive payable for exceptional performance in this plan is twice the target incentive.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P47_S0	An executive s individual award amount can be increased or decreased based on an assessment by the CEO (or the Board in the case of the CEO) of the executive s individual and team performance results.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P47_S1	After considering performance on individual and team goals, adjustments were made by the CEO for individual performance of certain Named Executive Officers below CEO in 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P47_S2	In recognition of the achievement of individual goals and the Company's financial performance, the Committee similarly recommended an award adjustment for the CEO in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P47_S3	The adjustments for individual performance are noted in the "Bonus" column on the Summary Compensation table and did not materially change the amounts resulting from 2017 achievement of the corporate goals.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P47_S4	The Board approved the incentive amounts shown below, which will be paid in March 2018:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P48_S0	Long-Term Incentive Compensation Long-term incentive compensation opportunities are designed to be competitive with market practices, reward long-term performance and promote retention.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P48_S1	Long-term incentive plan (LTI Plan) awards are denominated in units and are settled in cash if threshold performance measures are met.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P49_S0	Performance measures are based on two financial goals, total return (Total Return) and ROE, each measured over a three-year performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P49_S1	Total return reflects the change in the value of the Company during the performance cycle plus any distributions made to investors.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P50_S0	Achievement of each performance measure during the performance cycle is evaluated independently of the other.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S0	The Committee recommends for Board approval a targeted LTI grant value for each executive, which is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S1	The target LTI grant value is then converted into a target number of units, allocated equally among the two financial goals, based on the unit value on the grant date.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S2	The initial per-unit value is measured at the Puget Holdings level and is calculated annually by an independent auditing firm.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S3	The number of units ultimately earned may range from 0% to 200% of target depending on performance, with the payout being made in cash based on the number of units earned and the per-unit value at the end of the performance period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S4	Executives generally must be employed on the payment date to receive a cash payment under the LTI Plan, except in the event of retirement, disability or death.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S5	The Committee recommends for Board approval the number of LTI Plan units granted to each executive by evaluating long-term incentive grant values provided to similarly situated executives at comparable companies (using the previously discussed survey and peer group data) as well as other relevant executive-specific factors.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S6	The Committee generally does not consider previously granted awards or the level of accrued value from prior or other programs when making new LTI Plan grants.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S7	Half of the target units are earned based on Total Return and the other half are earned based on ROE, each over a 3-year performance period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P51_S8	These metrics and weightings have remained unchanged since the 2012 - 2014 grant cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P52_S0	2017-2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan Target Awards and Performance Goals Consistent with prior years, target LTI Plan awards for the 2017-2019 performance cycle were calculated based on a percentage of an executive's annual base salary, taking into account the executive's level of responsibility within the Company and the corresponding market data.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P52_S1	Target LTI Plan award amounts for the 2017-2019 performance cycle were 265% of base salary for Ms. Harris and 95% for Mr. Doyle, Mr. Secrist, Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey, which percentages were unchanged from amounts established for the 2016-2018 performance cycle, except for Ms. Harris.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P52_S2	The Board approved an increase in Ms. Harris target award from 220% to 265% to provide a target award that was market competitive.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P52_S3	The total number of target LTI Plan units granted to a Named Executive Officer for the 2017-2019 performance cycle is equal to the applicable percentage of salary (converted to dollars) divided by the per unit value at the beginning of the performance cycle, which was $52.37.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P52_S4	Details of the number of units granted and expected values at target, threshold and maximum performance levels can be found in the 2017 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P53_S0	Target Total Return is set annually by the Board prior to the grant date, and was set at 9.8% for the 2017-2019 performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P53_S1	Target ROE remains based on the ROE target in the Board s approved budget for each year.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P53_S2	Prior outstanding LTIP grants continue to have the performance targets and payout scales in effect at the time of grant.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P54_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2017-2019 performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P54_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P55_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P55_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P56_S0	Performance Scales for the 2016-2018 LTI Plan Grant The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2016-2018 performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P56_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P57_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P57_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P58_S0	Performance Scales for the 2015-2017 LTI Plan Grant The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the Total Return component that could be earned based on three-year performance during the 2015-2017 performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P58_S1	Payout percentages will be linearly interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P59_S0	The table below shows the percentage of LTI Plan target awards under the ROE component that could be earned based on average performance during the three-year performance period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P59_S1	Payout percentages will be interpolated if performance falls between the values shown below:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P60_S0	Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance 2015-2017 Performance Cycle The 2015-2017 performance cycle has now ended.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P61_S0	Amounts payable as a result of award vesting are shown in the following table:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P62_S0	Performance on Total Return in 2017 was 29.1%, which was significantly higher than target, reflecting an increase in valuation due to market transactions during 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P63_S0	Performance on the Total Return component for the three-year performance cycle was a compounded annual rate of 14.93%, above target and at the maximum of the funding scale.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P63_S1	The Total Return Component funded at 200% of target units.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P64_S0	Performance on the ROE component of the grant was an average of 102.2% of target for funding at 112.8% of target units.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P65_S0	The table below summarizes the status of the two other outstanding performance cycles from the initial grant date to December 31, 2017, with the projected payout assuming this same performance for the full three-year cycle under the applicable payout scales for Total Return and ROE:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P66_S0	The Company maintains the SERP to attract and retain executives by providing a benefit that is coordinated with the tax-qualified Retirement Plan for Employees of Puget Sound Energy, Inc. (Retirement Plan).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P66_S1	Without the addition of the SERP, these executives would receive lower percentages of replacement income during retirement than other employees.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P67_S0	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P67_S1	Additional information regarding the SERP and the Retirement Plan is shown in the 2017 Pension Benefits table.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P68_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Key Employees (Deferred Compensation Plan).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P68_S1	The Deferred Compensation Plan provides eligible executives an opportunity to defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive bonuses and earned LTI Plan awards, plus receive additional Company contributions made by PSE into an account that has three investment tracking fund choices.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P68_S2	The funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and an interest crediting fund that changes rates quarterly.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P69_S0	The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to allow the executives to defer current income, without being limited by the Internal Revenue Code contribution limitations for 401(k) plans and therefore have a deferral opportunity similar to other employees as a percentage of eligible compensation.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P69_S1	The Company contributions are also intended to restore benefits not available to executives under PSE s tax-qualified plans due to Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and benefits applicable to those plans.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P69_S2	Additional information regarding the Deferred Compensation Plan is shown in the 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P70_S0	Post-Termination Benefits Effective March 30, 2009, the Company entered into Executive Employment Agreements with the Named Executive Officers, except Mr. Doyle (who was not then employed by the Company) and Mr. Secrist (who was not then an officer).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P70_S1	The Executive Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control and provide severance benefits in the event of a qualifying termination of employment within two years of a change in control.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P70_S2	Since 2009, the Company has ceased entering into these agreements with new executive officers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P70_S3	Mr. Bussey was an officer of PSE at March 30, 2009, but left PSE in May 2009 and upon his rehire in March 2012 does not have an employment agreement with the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P71_S0	The Committee periodically reviews existing change in control and severance arrangements for the peer group companies.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P71_S1	Based on this information, the Committee believes that the current arrangements generally provide benefits that are similar to those of the comparator group for longer tenured executives, but is not extending them to newly hired executives.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P72_S0	The Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section describes the current post-termination arrangements with the Named Executive Officers as well as other plans and arrangements that would provide benefits on termination of employment or a change in control, and the estimated potential incremental payments upon a termination of employment or change in control based on an assumed termination or change in control date of December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S0	In addition to base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities, the Company also provides the Named Executive Officers with benefits and limited perquisites.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S1	The Company may provide payments upon hiring a new executive to help offset the executive s relocation expenses, a practice needed to attract qualified candidates from other areas of the country.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S2	The current executives participate in the same group health and welfare plans as other employees.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S3	Company vice presidents and above, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible for additional disability and life insurance benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S4	The executives are also eligible to receive reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation, legal services and business club memberships up to an annual limit.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S5	The reimbursement for financial planning, tax preparation and legal services is provided to allow executives to concentrate on their business responsibilities.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S6	Business club memberships are provided to allow access for business meetings and business events at club facilities and executives are required to reimburse the Company for personal use of club facilities.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S7	These perquisites generally do not make up a significant portion of executive compensation and did not exceed $10,000 in total for each Named Executive Officer in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P73_S8	Executives are taxed on the value of the perquisites received, with no corresponding gross-up by the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P74_S0	Relationship among Compensation Elements A number of compensation elements increase in absolute dollar value as a result of increases to other elements.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P75_S0	Base salary increases translate into higher dollar value opportunities for both annual and long-term incentives, because each plan operates with a target award set as a percentage of base salary.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P75_S1	Base salary increases also increase the level of retirement benefits, as do actual annual incentive plan payments.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P76_S0	Some key compensation elements are excluded from consideration when determining other elements of pay.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P77_S0	Retirement benefits exclude LTI Plan payments in the calculation of qualified retirement (pension and 401(k)) and SERP benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P78_S0	Impact of Accounting Treatment of Compensation The accounting treatment of compensation generally has not been a significant factor in determining the amounts of compensation for our executive officers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P78_S1	However, the Company considers the accounting impact of various program designs to balance the potential cost to the Company with the benefit/value to the executive.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P78_S2	With the changes in federal tax law enacted in 2018, the Company will become subject to IRS section 162(m) limitations on company deductions for executive pay.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P78_S3	Based on current understanding of the new tax law, the Company does not expect to make changes in program designs.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P79_S0	Risk Assessment A portion of each executive s total direct compensation is variable, at risk and tied to the Company s financial and operational performance to motivate and reward executives for the achievement of Company goals.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P79_S1	The Company s variable pay program helps focus executives on interests important to the Company and its investors and customers and creates a record of their results.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P79_S2	In structuring its incentive programs, the Company also strives to balance and moderate risk to the Company from such programs: individual award opportunities are defined and subject to limits, goal funding is based on collective company performance, annual incentive awards are balanced by long-term incentive awards that measure performance over three years, performance targets are based on management s operating plan (which includes providing good customer service), and all incentive awards to individual executives are subject to discretionary review by management, the Committee and/or the Board.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P80_S0	adverse effect on the Company and also provide appropriate incentive opportunities for executives to achieve Company goals that support the interests of our investors and customers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P81_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee Report The Board delegates responsibility to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee to establish and oversee the Company s executive compensation program.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P81_S1	Each member of the Committee served during all of 2017, except as noted below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P82_S0	The Committee members listed below have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Company s management.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P82_S1	Based on this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board has approved, that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P83_S0	Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of Puget Energy, Inc.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P84_S0	The following information is provided for the year ended December 31, 2017 (and for prior years where applicable) with respect to the Named Executive Officers during 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P84_S1	The positions listed below are at Puget Energy and PSE, except that Ms. Mellies and Mr. Bussey are executives of PSE only.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P84_S2	Positions listed are those held by the Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P85_S0	Salary and incentive compensation includes amounts deferred at the executive s election.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P86_S0	_______________ For 2017, reflects annual cash incentive compensation paid under the 2017 Goals and Incentive Plan and cash incentive compensation paid under the LTI Plan for the 2015-2017 performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P86_S1	Cash incentive amounts were paid in early 2018 or deferred at the executive's election.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P86_S2	The 2017 Goals and Incentive Plan and the LTI Plan are described in further detail under Compensation Discussion and Analysis, including the individual amounts paid to each Named Executive Officer in early 2018.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P87_S0	Reflects the aggregate increase in the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit under all pension plans during the year.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P87_S1	The amounts are determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements and include amounts which the executive may not currently be entitled to receive because such amounts are not vested.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P87_S2	In 2017, updated interest rates and mortality assumptions have generally increased the actuarial value of the underlying retirement benefits relative to assumptions for 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P87_S3	Information regarding these pension plans is set forth in further detail under 2017 Pension Benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P87_S4	The change in pension value amounts for 2017 are: Ms. Harris, $1,520,618; Mr. Doyle, $483,109; Mr. Secrist, $576,802, Ms. Mellies, $478,462; and Mr. Bussey, $465,653.

1085392_18_ITEM11_P90_S0	_______________ Reimbursement for financial planning, tax planning, and/or legal planning, with the initial plan up to a maximum of $5,000, and then annual reimbursement up to a maximum of $5,000 for Ms. Harris and $2,500 for the other Named Executive Officers.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P91_S0	Reflects the value of imputed income for life insurance and Company paid premiums on supplemental disability insurance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P92_S0	2017 Grants of Plan-Based Awards The following table presents information regarding 2017 grants of non-equity annual incentive awards and LTI Plan awards, including, as applicable, the range of potential payouts for the awards.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P93_S0	_______________ As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2017 Goals and Incentive Plan had dual funding triggers in 2017 of $1,156 million EBITDA and SQI performance of 6/10.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P93_S1	Payment would be $0 if either trigger is not met.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P93_S2	The threshold estimate assumes $1,156 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 6/10.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P93_S3	The target estimate assumes $1,284.4 million EBITDA and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P93_S4	The maximum estimate assumes $1,733.9 million EBITDA or higher and SQI/Safety measure performance at 10/10.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P94_S0	As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, LTI Plan grants for the 2017-2019 performance cycle were equally allocated between a Total Return component and an ROE component.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P94_S1	Payments are calculated based on Total Return at Puget Holdings during the three-year performance cycle, the average three-year performance of ROE and the unit value at the end of the performance cycle.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P95_S0	2017 Pension Benefits The Company and its affiliates maintain two pension plans: the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P95_S1	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding the actuarial present value of the executive s accumulated benefit and years of credited service under the Retirement Plan and the SERP.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P95_S2	The present value of accumulated benefits was determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in the Company s financial statements.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P95_S3	Each of the Named Executive Officers participates in both plans.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P96_S0	_______________ The amounts reported in this column for each executive were calculated assuming no future service or pay increases.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P96_S1	Present values were calculated assuming no pre-retirement mortality or termination.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P97_S0	The values under the Retirement Plan and the SERP are the actuarial present values as of December 31, 2017 of the benefits earned as of that date and payable at normal retirement age (age 65 for the Retirement Plan and age 62 for the SERP).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P97_S1	Future cash balance interest credits are assumed to be 4.0% annually.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P97_S2	The discount assumption is 4.00%, and the post-retirement mortality assumption is based on the 2018 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S0	Annuity benefits are converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.75%, 3.76%, and 4.66% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2017).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S1	These assumptions are consistent with the ones used for the Retirement Plan and the SERP for financial reporting purposes for 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S2	In order to determine the change in pension values for the Summary Compensation Table, the values of the Retirement Plan and the SERP benefits were also calculated as of December 31, 2016 for the benefits earned as of that date using the assumptions used for financial reporting purposes for 2016.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S3	These assumptions included assumed cash balance interest credits of 4.0%, a discount assumption of 4.50% and post-retirement mortality assumption based on the 2017 417(e) unisex mortality table.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S4	Annuity benefits were converted to lump sum amounts at retirement based on assumed future 417(e) segment rates of 1.52%, 3.80% and 4.79% (the 24-month average of the underlying rates as of September 2016).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P98_S5	Other assumptions used to determine the value as of December 31, 2016 were the same as those used for December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P99_S0	As described in footnote 1 above, the amounts reported for the SERP in this column are actuarial present values, calculated using the actuarial assumptions used for financial reporting purposes.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P99_S1	These assumptions are different from those used to calculate the actual amount of benefit payments under the SERP (see text below for a discussion of the actuarial assumptions used to calculate actual payment amounts).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P100_S0	The following table shows the estimated lump sum amount that would be paid under the SERP to each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer at age 62 (without discounting to the present), calculated as if such Named Executive Officer had terminated employment on December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P100_S1	Each SERP-eligible Named Executive Officer was vested in his or her SERP benefits as of December 31, 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S0	Retirement Plan Under the Retirement Plan, the Company's eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2014 (prior to December 12, 2014, in the case of IBEW-represented employees), including the Named Executive Officers, accrue benefits in accordance with a cash balance formula, beginning on the later of their date of hire or March 1, 1997.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S1	Under this formula, for each calendar year after 1996, age-weighted pay credits are allocated to a bookkeeping account (a Cash Balance Account) for each participant.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S2	The pay credits range from 3% to 8% of eligible compensation.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S3	Non-represented and UA-represented employees hired on or after January 1, 2014 and IBEW-represented employees hired on or after December 12, 2014 will receive pay credits equal to 4% (rather than the age-based pay credit described above), which non-represented and IBEW-represented employees may choose to have contributed to the Company s 401(k) plan, rather than credited under the Retirement Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S4	Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and bonuses (other than bonuses paid under the LTI Plan and signing, retention and similar bonuses), up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S5	For 2017, the limit was $270,000.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S6	For 2018, the limit is $275,000.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S7	In addition, as of March 1, 1997, the Cash Balance Account of each participant who was participating in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 1997 was credited with an amount based on the actuarial present value of that participant s accrued benefit, as of February 28, 1997, under the Retirement Plan s previous formula.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S8	Amounts in the Cash Balance Accounts are also credited with interest.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S9	The interest crediting rate is 4% per year or such higher amount as PSE may determine.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P101_S10	For 2017 and 2018, the annual interest crediting rate was 4%.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S0	A participant s Retirement Plan benefit generally vests upon the earlier of the participant s completion of three years of active service with Puget Energy, PSE or their affiliates or attainment of age 65 (the Retirement Plan s normal retirement age) while employed by the Company or one of its affiliates.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S1	Normal retirement benefit payments begin to a vested participant as of the first day of the month following the later of the participant s termination of employment or attainment of age 65.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S2	However, a vested participant may elect to have his or her benefit under the Retirement Plan paid, or commence to be paid, as of the first day of any month commencing after the date on which his or her employment with Puget Energy, PSE and their affiliates terminates.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S3	If benefit payments commence prior to the participant s attainment of age 65, then the amount of the monthly payments will be reduced for early commencement to reflect the fact that payments will be made over a longer period of time.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S4	This reduction is subsidized - that is, it is less than a pure actuarial reduction.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S5	The amount of this reduction is, on average, 0.30% for each of the first 60 months, 0.33% for each of the second 60 months, 0.23% for each of the third 60 months and 0.17% for each of the fourth 60 months that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S6	Further reductions apply for each additional month that the payment commencement date precedes the participant s 65th birthday.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P102_S7	As of December 31, 2017, all the Named Executive Officers were vested in their benefits under the Retirement Plan and, hence, would be eligible to commence benefit payments upon termination.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P103_S0	The normal form of benefit payment for unmarried participants is a straight life annuity providing monthly payments for the remainder of the participant s life, with no death benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P103_S1	The straight life annuity payable on or after the participant's normal retirement age is actuarially equivalent to the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P104_S0	For married participants, the normal form of benefit payment is an actuarially equivalent joint and 50% survivor annuity with a pop-up feature providing reduced monthly payments (as compared to the straight life annuity) for the remainder of the participant s life and, upon the participant s death, monthly payments to the participant s surviving spouse for the remainder of the spouse s life in an amount equal to 50% of the amount being paid to the participant.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P104_S1	Under the pop-up feature, if the participant s spouse predeceases the participant, the participant s monthly payments increase to the level that would have been provided under the straight life annuity.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P104_S2	In addition, the Retirement Plan provides several other annuity payment options and a lump sum payment option that can be elected by participants.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P104_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P104_S4	However, in no event will the amount of the lump sum payment be less than the balance in the participant s Cash Balance Account as of the date of distribution (in some instances the amount of the lump sum distribution may be greater than the balance in the Cash Balance Account due to differences in the mortality table and interest rates used to calculate actuarial equivalency).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P105_S0	If a vested participant dies before his or her Retirement Plan benefit is paid, or commences to be paid, then the participant s Retirement Plan benefit will be paid to his or her beneficiary(ies).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P105_S1	If a participant dies after his or her Retirement Plan benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the participant.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P106_S0	The SERP provides a benefit to participating Named Executive Officers that supplements the retirement income provided to the executives by the Retirement Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P106_S1	All the Named Executive Officers participate in the SERP.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P106_S2	A participating Named Executive Officer s SERP benefit generally vests upon the executive s completion of five years of participation in the SERP and attainment of age 55 while employed by the Company or any of its affiliates.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P106_S3	However, SERP participants as of December 31, 2012, who have not yet attained age 55, including Ms. Harris and Mr. Secrist, have been exempted from the age 55 vesting requirement.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P106_S4	All the participating Named Executive Officers are vested in their SERP benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P107_S0	The monthly benefit payable under the SERP to a Named Executive Officer (calculated in the form of a straight life annuity payable for the executive s lifetime commencing at the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62) is equal to (i) below minus the sum of (ii) and (iii) below: i. One-twelfth (1/12) of the executive s highest average earnings times the executive s years of credited service (not in excess of 15) times 3-1/3%.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P107_S1	For purposes of the SERP, highest average earnings means the average of the executive s highest three consecutive calendar years of earnings.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P107_S2	The three consecutive calendar years must be among the last ten calendar years completed by the executive prior to his or her termination.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P108_S0	Prior to December 31, 2012, a participant's highest average earnings was not required to be calculated based on a three consecutive year basis.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P108_S1	Executives participating in the SERP as of December 31, 2012 will have their highest average earnings on that date preserved as a minimum value for highest average earnings in the future.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P108_S2	Earnings for this purpose include base salary and annual bonus, but do not include long-term incentive compensation.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P109_S0	An executive will receive one year of credited service for each consecutive 12-month period he or she is employed by the Company or its affiliates.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P109_S1	If an executive becomes entitled to disability benefits under PSE s long-term disability plan, then the executive s highest average earnings will be determined as of the date the executive became disabled, but the executive will continue to accrue years of credited service until he or she begins to receive SERP benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P110_S0	The monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) under the Retirement Plan to the executive in the form of a straight life annuity commencing as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62, including amounts previously paid or segregated pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P110_S1	The actuarially equivalent monthly amount payable (or that would be payable) to the executive as of the first day of the month following the later of the executive s date of termination or attainment of age 62 from any pension-type rollover accounts within the Deferred Compensation Plan (including the annual cash balance restoration account).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P110_S2	These accounts are described in more detail in the 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S0	Normal retirement benefits under the SERP generally are paid or commence to be paid within 90 days following the later of the Named Executive Officer s termination of employment or attainment of age 62.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S1	Except as provided below, SERP benefits are normally paid in a lump sum that is equal to the actuarial present value of the monthly straight life annuity benefit.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S2	In lieu of the normal form of payment, an executive may elect to receive his or her SERP benefit in the form of monthly installment payments over a period of two to 20 years, in a straight life annuity or in a joint and survivor annuity with a 100%, 75%, 50% or 25% survivor benefit.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S3	All payment options are actuarially equivalent to the straight life annuity.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S4	An executive may also elect to have his or her SERP benefit transferred to the Deferred Compensation Plan and paid in accordance with his or her elections under that plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S5	An executive may elect to have his or her SERP benefit paid, or commence to be paid, upon termination of employment after attaining age 55 but prior to attaining age 62.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S6	The SERP benefit of any executive who receives such early retirement benefits will be reduced by 1/3% for each month that the early commencement date precedes the beginning of the month coincident with or next following the date on which the executive attains age 62.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S7	If a participating Named Executive Officer dies while employed by Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates or after becoming vested in his or her SERP benefit, but before his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then the executive s surviving spouse will receive a lump sum benefit equal to the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit such spouse would have received under the joint and 50% survivor annuity option.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S8	This amount will be calculated assuming the executive would have commenced benefit payments in that form on the first day of the month following the later of his or her death or attainment of age 62, with any applicable reductions for early commencement if the executive dies before age 62.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S9	If the executive is not married, then no death benefit will be paid.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P111_S10	If an executive dies after his or her SERP benefit has commenced to be paid, then any death benefit will be governed by the form of payment elected by the executive.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P112_S0	The following table provides information for each of the Named Executive Officers regarding aggregate executive and Company contributions and aggregate earnings for 2017 and year-end account balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S0	_______________ The amount in this column reflects elective deferrals by the executive of salary, annual incentive compensation or LTI Plan awards paid in 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S1	Deferred salary amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $27,866; Mr. Secrist, $32,355; Ms. Mellies, $10,706; and Mr. Bussey, $0.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S2	Deferred incentive compensation amounts are: Ms. Harris, $0; Mr. Doyle, $0; Mr. Secrist, $0; Ms. Mellies, $0; and Mr. Bussey, $0.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S3	The amounts are also included in the applicable column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S4	The amount reported in this column reflects contributions by PSE consisting of the annual investment plan restoration amount and annual cash balance restoration amount described below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S5	These amounts are also included in the total amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S6	The amount in this column for each executive reflects the change in value of investment tracking funds.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P113_S7	Above market earnings on these amounts are included in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2017.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P114_S0	The Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan and may defer up to 100% of base salary, annual incentive compensation and LTI Plan payments.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P114_S1	In addition, each year, executives are eligible to receive Company contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan to restore benefits not available to them under the Company's tax-qualified plans due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P114_S2	The annual investment plan restoration amount equals the additional matching and any other employer contribution under the 401(k) plan that would have been credited to an electing executive s 401(k) plan account if the Internal Revenue Code limitations were not in place and if deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan were instead made to the 401(k) plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P114_S3	The annual cash balance restoration amount equals the actuarial equivalent of any reductions in an executive s accrued benefit under the Retirement Plan due to Internal Revenue Code limitations or as a result of deferrals under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P114_S4	An executive must generally be employed on the last day of the year to receive these Company contributions, unless he or she retires or dies during the year in which case the Company will contribute a prorated amount.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P115_S0	The Named Executive Officers choose how to credit deferred amounts among three investment tracking funds.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P115_S1	The tracking funds mirror performance in major asset classes of bonds, stocks, and a money market index.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P115_S2	For deferrals prior to 2012, an interest crediting fund was available.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P115_S3	The tracking funds differ from the investment funds offered in the 401(k) plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P115_S4	The 2017 calendar year returns of these tracking funds were:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P116_S0	The Named Executive Officers may change how deferrals are allocated to the tracking funds at any time.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P116_S1	Changes generally become effective as of the first trading day of the following calendar quarter.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P117_S0	The Named Executive Officers generally may choose how and when to receive payments under the Deferred Compensation Plan.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P118_S0	There are three types of in-service withdrawals.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P119_S0	First, an executive may choose an interim payment of deferred amounts by designating a plan year for payment at the time of his or her deferral election.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P119_S1	The interim payment is made in a lump sum within 60 days after the last day of the designated plan year, which must be at least two years following the plan year of the deferral.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P119_S2	Second, an in-service withdrawal may also be made to an executive upon a qualifying hardship event and demonstrated need.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P119_S3	Third, only with respect to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005, the executive may elect an in-service withdrawal for any reason by paying a 10% penalty.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P120_S0	Payments upon termination of employment depend on whether the executive is then eligible for retirement.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P120_S1	If the executive's termination occurs prior to his or her retirement date (generally the earlier of attaining age 62 or age 55 with five years of credited service), the executive will receive a lump sum payment of his or her account balance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P120_S2	If the executive s termination occurs after his or her retirement date, the executive may choose to receive payments in a lump sum or via one of several installment options (fixed amount, specified amount, annual or monthly installments, of up to 20 years).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P121_S0	Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control The Estimated Potential Incremental Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control table below reflects the estimated amount of incremental compensation payable to each of the Named Executive Officers in the event of (i) a change in control; (ii) an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason in connection with a change in control; (iii) retirement; (iv) disability; or (v) death.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P122_S0	Certain Company benefit plans provide incremental benefits or payments in the event of certain terminations of employment.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P122_S1	In addition, Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies are each parties to an Executive Employment Agreement with the Company, dated March 2009.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P122_S2	The agreements provide for benefits or payments upon certain qualifying terminations of employment from the Company following a change in control.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P122_S3	The only benefit payable to the Named Executive Officers solely upon a change in control is accelerated vesting of LTI Plan awards, under certain conditions, as described below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P123_S0	Disability and Life Insurance Plans If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will receive benefits under the PSE disability plan or life insurance plan available generally to all salaried employees.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P123_S1	These disability and life insurance amounts are not reflected in the table below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P123_S2	The Named Executive Officer is also eligible to receive supplemental disability and life insurance.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P123_S3	The supplemental monthly disability coverage is 65% of monthly base salary and target annual incentive pay, reduced by (i) amounts receivable under the PSE disability plan generally available to salaried employees and (ii) certain other income benefits.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P123_S4	The supplemental life insurance benefit is provided at two times base salary and target annual incentive bonus if the executive dies while employed by PSE with a reduction for amounts payable under the applicable group life insurance policy.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P124_S0	LTI Plan Awards If a Named Executive Officer s employment terminates due to disability or death, the executive or his or her estate will be paid a pro-rata portion of LTI Plan awards that were granted in a prior year.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P124_S1	In the case of retirement at normal retirement age or approved early retirement, pro-rata LTI Plan awards will be paid in the first quarter following the year of retirement, based on performance through the prior year.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P124_S2	In the event of a change in control in which awards are not assumed or substituted, outstanding LTI Plan awards will be paid on a pro-rata basis at the higher of (i) target performance or (ii) actual performance achieved during the performance cycle ending with the fiscal quarter that precedes the change in control.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P125_S0	Employment Agreements with Certain Named Executive Officers In March 2009, PSE entered into Executive Employment Agreements (Employment Agreements) with each of Ms. Harris and Ms. Mellies (the Covered Executives).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P125_S1	The Employment Agreements provide for an employment period of two years following a change in control.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P125_S2	In the event of a termination of employment within two years of a change in control (a Covered Termination), a Covered Executive is eligible to receive the payments described below.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P126_S0	A change in control generally means a person (or group of persons) (with certain exceptions set forth in the Employment Agreements) acquires (i) beneficial ownership of more than 55% of the total combined voting power of the Company s securities outstanding immediately after such acquisition (other than through a registered public offering) or (ii) all or substantially all of the Company s assets.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P127_S0	Payments upon Involuntary Termination without Cause or for Good Reason If a Covered Executive s employment is terminated without cause by the Company or is terminated by the Covered Executive for good reason within two years of a change in control, the Covered Executive is eligible to receive the following compensation and benefits:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P128_S0	Pro-rated annual incentive bonus for the year in which termination occurs (Annual Bonus).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P129_S0	Continued group medical, dental, disability and life insurance benefits to the Covered Executive and his or her family for the remainder of the two-year protection period.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P129_S1	Benefits will be paid by the Company while the Covered Executive is eligible for COBRA and thereafter by reimbursement of payments made by the Covered Executive for such coverage (including related tax amounts), except that if the Covered Executive becomes re-employed with another employer and is eligible to receive medical or other welfare benefits under another employer-provided plan, the medical and other welfare benefits under the Employment Agreement will become secondary to those provided by the other employer (the foregoing benefit is referred to as Health and Welfare Benefit Continuation).
1085392_18_ITEM11_P130_S0	Under the Employment Agreements, cause and good reason have the following meanings:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P131_S0	Cause generally means (i) the willful and continued failure by the Covered Executive to substantially perform the Covered Executive s duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 30 days after written notice of demand for substantial performance has been delivered to the Covered Executive or (ii) the Covered Executive s willfully engaging in gross misconduct materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company, as determined by the Board after notice to the executive and opportunity for a hearing.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P131_S1	No act or failure to act on the Covered Executive s part is considered willful unless the Covered Executive has acted or failed to act with an absence of good faith and without a reasonable belief that the Covered Executive s action or failure to act was in the best interests of the Company.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P132_S0	Good Reason generally means (i) the assignment of the Covered Executive to a non-officer position with the Company, which the parties agree would constitute a material reduction in the Covered Executive s authority, duties or responsibilities; (ii) a material diminution in the Covered Executive s total compensation opportunities under the Employment Agreement; (iii) the Company s requiring the Covered Executive to be based at any location that represents a material change from the Covered Executive s location in the Seattle/Bellevue metropolitan area, unless the Covered Executive consents to the relocation; or (iv) a material breach of the Employment Agreement by the Company, provided that, in any of the foregoing, the Company has not remedied the alleged violation(s) within 60 days of notice from the Covered Executive.

1085392_18_ITEM11_P134_S3	The Employment Agreements contain a non-disparagement clause and a confidentiality clause pursuant to which the Covered Executives must keep confidential all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Company and its affiliates obtained during their employment.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P134_S4	The Covered Executives may not disclose any such information, knowledge or data after their respective terminations of employment unless PSE consents in writing or as required by law.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P135_S0	If any payments paid or payable in connection with a change in control while the Company's stock is not traded on an established securities market or otherwise immediately before such change in control, then the Covered Executive will agree to execute a waiver of any excess parachute payments (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), provided that the Company agrees to seek, but is not required to obtain, shareholder approval of the amount payable in connection with termination of employment, in which case the waived amounts will be restored to the Covered Executive.

1085392_18_ITEM11_P140_S0	For 2017, our last completed fiscal year:
1085392_18_ITEM11_P141_S0	As a result, for 2017 the ratio of annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and President, to the median of our annual total compensation of all employees was 66:1.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P142_S0	We identified our median employee by examining the total cash compensation we paid during 2017 to all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by us on December 31, 2017, which totaled approximately 3,160 individuals, all located in the United States (as reported in Item 1. Business), including employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P142_S1	Total cash compensation consisted of base salary, overtime, paid time off and annual incentives as reflected in our payroll records.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P142_S2	We consistently applied this compensation measure and did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P142_S3	We believe that the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because it includes all major compensation elements available to employees.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P142_S4	Pay for all non-represented employees in the organization is benchmarked periodically to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy of paying at the market median.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P143_S0	After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation for 2017, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee for 2017 using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table in accordance with the requirements of Item 402 (c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. Annual total compensation for 2017 for our median employee included annual salary, annual incentives, company contributions towards benefits including retirement.
1085392_18_ITEM11_P143_S1	Annual total compensation for 2017 for our CEO consists of the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2017 Summary Compensation Table.

1085392_18_ITEM11_P146_S0	Nonemployee Director Compensation Program The 2017 nonemployee director compensation program is based on the principles that the level of nonemployee director compensation should be based on Board and committee responsibilities and should be competitive with comparable companies.

1085392_18_ITEM11_P150_S2	Nonemployee directors are permitted to make changes in measurement fund allocations quarterly.

1085392_18_ITEM13_P0_S1	Under the policy, our directors and executive officers are expected to disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer the material facts of any transaction that could be considered a related person transaction promptly upon gaining knowledge of the transaction.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P1_S0	A related person transaction is generally defined as any transaction required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P2_S0	Any transaction reported to the Chief Compliance Officer will be reviewed according to the following procedures:
1085392_18_ITEM13_P3_S0	If the Chief Compliance Officer determines that disclosure of the transaction is not required under the SEC s related person transaction disclosure rule, the transaction will be deemed approved and will be reported to the Audit Committee.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P4_S0	If disclosure is required, the Chief Compliance Officer will submit the transaction to the Chair of the Audit Committee who will review and, if authorized, will determine whether to approve or ratify the transaction.

1085392_18_ITEM13_P11_S0	Board of Directors and Corporate Governance Independence of the Board The Boards of Puget Energy and PSE have reviewed the relationships between Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries) and each of their respective directors.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P11_S1	Based on this review, the Boards have determined that of the members constituting the Boards, Steven Hooper (member of the Boards of both Puget Energy and PSE), Scott Armstrong (member of the Board of PSE and added to the Board of Puget Energy at the November, 2017 Board Meeting), and Barbara Gordon (member of the Board of PSE) are independent under the NYSE corporate governance listing standards and also meet the definition of an Independent Director under the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P12_S0	Under the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Puget Energy and PSE, an Independent Director is a director who: (i) shall not be a member of Puget Holdings (referred to as a Holdings Member) or an affiliate of any Holdings Member (including by way of being a member, stockholder, director, manager, partner, officer or employee of any such member), (ii) shall not be an officer or employee of PSE, (iii) shall be a resident of the state of Washington, and (iv) if and to the extent required with respect to any specific director, shall meet such other qualifications as may be required by any applicable regulatory authority for an independent director or manager.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P12_S1	The Company s definition of "Independent Director" is available in the Corporate Governance Guidelines at www.pugetenergy.com.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S0	In making these independence determinations, the Boards have established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired solely as a result of the director, or a company for which the director or an immediate family member of the director serves as an executive officer, making payments to PSE for power or natural gas provided by PSE at rates fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, unless such payments would automatically disqualify the director under the NYSE s corporate governance listing standards.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S1	The Boards have also established a categorical standard that a director s independence is not impaired if a director is a director, employee or executive officer of another company that makes payments to or receives payments from Puget Energy, PSE or any of their affiliates, for property or services in an amount which is less than the greater of $1.0 million or one percent of such other company s consolidated gross revenue, determined for the most recent fiscal year.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S2	These categorical standards will not apply, however, to the extent that Puget Energy or PSE would be required to disclose an arrangement as a related person transaction pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S3	The Boards considered all relationships between its directors and Puget Energy and PSE (and their respective subsidiaries), including some that are not required to be disclosed in this report as related-person transactions.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S4	Mr. Hooper and Mr. Armstrong, Ms. McWilliams and former Board member Melanie Dressel serve (or served) as directors or officers of, or otherwise have/had a financial interest in, entities that make payments to PSE for energy services provided to those entities at tariff rates established by the Washington Commission.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S5	These transactions fall within the first categorical independence standard described above.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P13_S6	Because these relationships either fall within the Boards' categorical independence standards or involve an amount that is not material to the Company or the other entity, the Boards have concluded that none of these relationships impair the independence of the applicable directors.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P14_S0	Executive Sessions Non-management directors meet in executive session on a regular basis, generally on the same date as each scheduled Board meeting.
1085392_18_ITEM13_P14_S1	Mr. Hooper, who is not a member of management, presides over the executive sessions.
