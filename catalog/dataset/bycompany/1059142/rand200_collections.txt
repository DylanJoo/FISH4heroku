1059142_11_ITEM1_P0_S0	America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P0_S1	Interest paid on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P0_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owned 21 federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $189.3 million as of December 31, 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P1_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 21 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 4,042 rental units located in the states of Florida, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Illinois, and Ohio, one multifamily residential apartment complex under construction in Texas that will contain a total of 76 rental units, and a 142-bed student housing facility in Nebraska.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P1_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P1_S3	Each bond is secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac (see Notes 2, 9 and 10).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P2_S1	Six of the entities that own the apartment properties financed by six of the Partnership's tax exempt bonds were deemed to be Consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") of the Partnership at December 31, 2010 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P2_S2	Two bonds secured by the three properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ) subject to a sales agreement (see Note 6) are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P3_S0	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P4_S0	The ability of the properties collateralizing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P5_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P6_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P6_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P6_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P7_S0	Because the return to the Partnership from its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the multifamily residential properties which collateralize these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other multifamily rental properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with its tax-exempt bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership may also invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P8_S1	These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P8_S2	To date, the Partnership has not made any investments of this type.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P9_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P9_S1	The Partnership does this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in the best long-term interest of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership generally does not seek to acquire direct interests in real property as long term or permanent investments.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Partnership may, however, acquire real estate securing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S2	In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in tax-exempt bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S3	The Partnership currently holds interests in eight MF Properties containing 964 rental units, of which three are located in Ohio and are currently subject to a sales agreement, two are located in Kentucky, one is located in Virginia, one is located in North Carolina and one is located in Georgia.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S4	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S5	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S6	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the Partnership's initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P10_S7	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P11_S0	Current credit markets and general economic conditions have resulted in very few LIHTC syndication and tax-exempt bond financing transactions being completed in recent years.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P11_S1	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and should provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities when the market for LIHTC syndications strengthens.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P12_S0	Until the market for LIHTC syndication transactions strengthens, the Partnership will explore other transactions for the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital and (ii) provide regular and increasing cash distributions to our unitholders which are substantially exempt from federal income tax.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P13_S1	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by first mortgages on, multifamily apartment properties, including student housing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P13_S2	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed apartment properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to our unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and related investments, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the tax-exempt securities market and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P14_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P15_S0	use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P16_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P16_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P17_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected tax-exempt bonds that are secured by multifamily properties that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P17_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required which, if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle the Partnership to receive payment of contingent interest on its bond investment.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P17_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P17_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other tax-exempt investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P17_S4	We may also be able to use a higher-quality investment portfolio to obtain higher leverage to be used to acquire additional investments.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P18_S0	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, but may also consider bonds issued to finance student housing projects and housing for senior citizens.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P18_S1	The four basic types of multifamily housing revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM1_P19_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P19_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable apartment project financed with tax-exempt bonds must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P19_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the apartment project may be rented at market rates.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P20_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the apartment project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P20_S1	Multifamily housing bonds that were issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P21_S0	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed apartment project.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P21_S1	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P21_S2	We expect to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P21_S3	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Partnership invests in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on multifamily apartment projects.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P22_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P22_S2	Six of the 21 bonds currently owned by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying apartment properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P22_S3	As a result, the amount of interest earned by the Partnership from its investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P23_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Partnership may invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P24_S1	These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P25_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are held by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S0	While the Partnership generally does not seek to acquire equity interests in real property as long-term or permanent investments, it may acquire real estate securing its revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S1	In addition, as part of its growth strategy, the Partnership may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to position itself for a future investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such apartment complexes by a new owner.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new tax-exempt bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S3	The Partnership may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S4	After the LIHTC compliance period, the Partnership would expect to sell its interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek tax-exempt bond financing on the MF Property which the Partnership could acquire.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S5	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the acquisition by the Partnership of an interest in an MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P26_S6	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P27_S0	There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily housing in the United States.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P27_S1	The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) reports that there are approximately 7.1 million American households in need of quality affordable housing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P27_S2	The types of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P27_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the income paid on these bonds is exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P28_S0	The National Council of State Housing Agencies Fact Sheet and HUD have captured some key scale metrics and opportunities of this market:
1059142_11_ITEM1_P29_S0	The availability of tax-exempt bond financing for affordable multifamily housing to be owned by private, for-profit developers in each state in each calendar year is limited by the statewide volume cap distributed as described in Section 146 of the Internal Revenue Code; this private activity bond financing is based on state population and indexed to inflation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P30_S0	The supply of rental units is expected to fall short of demand with apartment vacancies continuing to decline.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P31_S0	In addition to tax-exempt revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P31_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with tax-exempt bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P31_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P31_S3	The Partnership does not invest in LIHTCs, but is attracted to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and; therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P32_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P32_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P32_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P33_S0	The 2008 Housing Act simplified and expanded the use of LIHTCs and tax-exempt bond financing for low-income multifamily housing industry.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P33_S1	Additionally, it exempted newly issued tax-exempt private activity bonds from Alternative Minimum Tax.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P33_S2	Previously, these tax-exempt private activity bonds were Alternative Minimum Tax preference items for individual taxpayers.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P33_S3	We believe these changes should enhance the Partnership's opportunities for making investments in accordance with its investment criteria.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P34_S0	Current credit markets and general economic issues have had a significant negative impact on these types of transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P34_S1	At this time very few LIHTC syndication and tax-exempt bond financing transactions are being completed.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P34_S2	While these types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership, they are not the current investment focus.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P35_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting restrictions on the availability of debt financing that had prevailed since 2008 began to subside in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P35_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has increased significantly from two years ago, overall availability remains limited and the cost of credit may continue to be adversely impacted.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P35_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P36_S0	Many participants in the multifamily housing debt sector either reduced their participation in the market or were forced to liquidate some or all of their existing portfolio investments in order to meet their liquidity needs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P36_S1	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P36_S2	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P36_S3	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P37_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt, together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company, can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P37_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of tax-exempt bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional tax-exempt housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S4	In addition, the economic conditions including higher levels of unemployment, lack of job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy during the past two years.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S5	Overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 81% during both 2010 as compared to 84% during 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S6	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has remained at approximately 83% during both years 2010 and 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S7	These issues may continue to negatively affect property operations and profitability in the shortterm.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P38_S8	We expect that property operations will improve in 2011 and 2012 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will be positive.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S0	At December 31, 2010 , the Partnership has outstanding debt financing of $95.6 million secured by 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with a total par value of $125.6 million plus approximately $15.2 million in restricted cash.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S1	Our operating policy is to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , the debt outstanding related to the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio of approximately $189.3 million results in a leverage ratio of 51%.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S3	The outstanding debt financing is a Tax-Exempt Bond Securitization facility ( TEBS ) with Freddie Mac (see Note 9).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S4	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $10.6 million.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S5	These mortgage loans mature at various times from November 2011 through November 2013 (see Note 10).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P40_S6	The total debt financing plus mortgage loans of $106.2 million results in a leverage ratio to Total Assets of 44%.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S1	Through December 31, 2010, the Partnership had issued a total of 20,285,000 additional BUCs raising net proceeds of approximately $108.2 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $7.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S2	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S3	The most recent issuance, included above, was completed in April 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S4	The Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P41_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million (see Note 11).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P42_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership acquired the Briarwood Manor Apartments tax-exempt private activity mortgage revenue bond for approximately $4.5 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P42_S1	The bond's approximate outstanding par value is $5.5 million and earns interest at an annual rate of 5.3% with a monthly interest and principal payment and stated maturity date of June 1, 2038.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P42_S2	Based on the purchase price discount, the bond will yield approximately 7.0% to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P43_S0	The bond was issued for the construction of the Briarwood Manor Apartments, a 100 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Montclair, California, in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P43_S1	The bond does not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P44_S0	In November 2010, the Partnership acquired the Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt private activity mortgage revenue bond for approximately $12.3 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P44_S1	The bond's approximate outstanding par value is $13.4 million and earns interest at an annual rate of 5.8% with a monthly interest and principal payment and stated maturity date of October 1, 2046.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P44_S2	Based on the purchase price discount, the bond will yield approximately 7.0% to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P44_S3	The bond was issued for the construction of the Autumn Pines Apartments , a 250 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Humble, Texas, in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P44_S4	The bond does not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods (I and II) and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ), were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S3	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S4	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 10.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S5	Both series of bonds mature in June 2050.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S6	The Company had previously acquired a 99% interest in the Ohio Properties as part of its strategy of acquiring existing multifamily apartment properties that it expects will be partially financed with new tax-exempt mortgage bonds at the time the properties become eligible for the issuance of additional LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S7	In addition to the new tax-exempt bonds acquired by the Company, the plan of financing for the acquisition included other subordinated debt issued by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S8	The new owners ultimately plan to sell limited partnership interests in the properties and syndicate LIHTCs as part of the overall plan of finance.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P45_S9	The new owners have not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company has effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S0	Pursuant to accounting guidance for property, plant, and equipment - real estate sales, the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for derecognition of the properties or full accrual accounting for the gain.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S1	The guidance requires sufficient equity capital as part of a sales transaction to indicate a commitment from the buyer (typically a minimum of 3 to 5% investment by the new owners).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S2	As the buyer has no equity capital in this transaction and the property operations are the current support for the debt service, the Company, in substance, remains the owner for accounting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S3	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S4	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S5	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P46_S6	The properties will continue to be presented as MF Properties and no gain will be recognized until such time as the transaction meets the criteria for derecognition of the properties and gain recognition (see Note 5 and 6).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Partnership continues to monitor the three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Gardens of DeCordova) and Residences at Weatherford ("Weatherford") (f/k/a The Gardens of Weatherford).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P48_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , Woodland Park owes the Partnership approximately $15.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and approximately $914,000 under taxable loans; DeCordova owes the Partnership approximately $4.9 million under tax-exempt bonds and $648,000 under taxable loans; and Weatherford owes the Partnership approximately $4.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and $1.1 million under taxable loans.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P49_S0	is a discussion of the circumstances related to each of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S0	The construction of Woodland Park was completed in November 2008 and lease-up continues, however, the property has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S1	Additionally, there was insufficient funds on deposit with the bond trustee to make the debt service payment of approximately $452,000 on the bonds which was due on May 3, 2010 and the property owner did not provide additional capital to fund the shortfall.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S2	As a result, a payment default on the bonds occurred.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S3	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and started the foreclosure process.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S4	The foreclosure process is expected to be complete in the first half of 2011.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S5	This action will allow a new property owner to re-syndicate the LIHTCs associated with this property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S6	If the LIHTCs can be successfully re-syndicated, it will provide additional capital to the project which can be used to support debt service payments on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds until property operations improve to the point that sufficient cash is generated to pay any past due amounts on the bonds as well as ongoing debt service.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P50_S7	If the re-syndication is not successful, the Partnership may pursue other options including making additional taxable loans to the property or completing the foreclosure process and taking direct ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Partnership believes that the most significant issue in the slow lease-up of the property and its failure to achieve stabilization has been the 100% set aside of the rental units for tenants that make less than 60% of the area median income.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S1	At the request of the Partnership, in April 2010, the property owner reduced the number of units set aside for affordable tenants to 75% and began leasing 59 units to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S2	Additionally, the property owner has agreed that, if needed to stabilize the property, it would further reduce the units set aside for affordable tenants to 60% thereby making an additional 35 units available to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S3	As of December 31, 2009, the property had 116 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 49% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 190 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 81% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P51_S5	Based on the level of leasing activity resulting from the change in the mix of affordable and market rate tenants, the Partnership continues to believe that Woodland is capable of reaching stabilization.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P52_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Granbury, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P52_S1	Construction was completed in April 2009 and lease-up continues, however, the property has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S0	In January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove the limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S1	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S2	At that time the general partner was allowed to continue in that capacity and a new limited partner was admitted.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S3	The foreclosure was a reconsideration event under the variable interest entity guidance and as a result of the reevaluation, the bond was eliminated and the entity which owns the property was consolidated as a VIE effective March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S4	At the request of the Partnership, in April 2010, the property owners reduced the number of units set aside for affordable tenants to 60% and began leasing 30 units to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S5	The property continued to experience slow lease-up and in December 2010, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S6	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S7	As of December 31, 2009, the property had 31 units leased out of total available units of 76, or 41% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S8	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 65 units leased out of total available units of 76, or approximately 86% physical occupancy and an additional eight leases are pending.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S9	At this time the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P53_S10	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment in DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P54_S0	Residences at Weatherford are currently under construction and will contain 76 units upon completion.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P55_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Weatherford, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P55_S1	At this time infrastructure construction activities have been substantially completed but no construction has begun on the actual apartment buildings.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S0	In January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default through the bond trustee and began foreclosure procedures to remove the limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S1	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S2	At that time the general partner was allowed to continue in that capacity and a new limited partner was admitted.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S3	The foreclosure was a reconsideration event under the variable interest entity guidance and as a result of the reevaluation, the bond was eliminated and the entity that owns the property was consolidated as a VIE effective in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S4	Through this process the Partnership anticipated that the new property owner would recapitalize the property by pursuing an alternative plan of financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S5	Specifically, the Partnership worked with the general partner of the owner to identify available Tax Credit Assistance Program ( TCAP ) funding through application to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs ( TDHCA ).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P56_S6	In March 2010, a TCAP Written Agreement with TDHCA was approved and entered into which committed TCAP funds to the project pending the completion of formal agreements.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S0	process was delayed due to the large number of transactions to be closed by TDHCA.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S1	During the delay, TDHCA identified certain issues in funding and compliance with other projects in which the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford is involved.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S2	As a result of these issues, in October 2010, TDHCA issued a Notice of Termination of TCAP Funding to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S3	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S4	Based on the termination notice, the Company has determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation was impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S5	As of December 31, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P57_S6	The resulting impairment charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $3.3 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P58_S0	As a result of the failure of the property owner to secure an alternative plan of financing, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the General Partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P58_S1	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P58_S2	The Partnership has taken over the project and intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the project.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P58_S3	Upon the completion of construction, the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P58_S4	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment in Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Partnership evaluated all its bond holdings, including the three discussed above, for an other-than-temporary decline in value and any related taxable loans for potential impairment as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM1_P59_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of its tax-exempt bond holdings existed at December 31, 2010 for Woodland Park and DeCordova, but an impairment of approximately $2.7 million was recorded for Weatherford during 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P59_S2	The Partnership also concluded that the taxable loans made to DeCordova were not impaired, however, an allowance for loan loss of approximately $900,000 was recorded to reserve for the entire taxable loan balance due from Woodland Park.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P59_S3	The Partnership will continue to monitor these investments for changes in circumstances that might warrant an impairment charge.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P60_S0	The Partnership is managed by its general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 ) which is an affiliate of The Burlington Capital Group LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_11_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Partnership has no employees, executive officers or directors.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P60_S2	Certain services are provided to the Partnership by employees of Burlington, which is the general partner of AFCA 2, and the Partnership reimburses Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P60_S3	The Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P61_S0	The Partnership competes with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership for the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P61_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S0	Because the Partnership holds tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured entirely by multifamily residential properties and holds an interest in the MF Properties, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other residential real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S2	Multifamily properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S3	To compete effectively, the apartment properties financed or owned by the Partnership must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Partnership's apartment properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P62_S5	These apartment properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Partnership believes that each of the MF Properties and the properties collateralizing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P64_S0	The Partnership is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, it makes no provision for income taxes.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P64_S1	The distributive share of the Partnership's income, deductions and credits is included in each unitholder's income tax return.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P65_S0	The Partnership's subsidiaries are C corporations for income tax purposes and file separate income tax returns.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P65_S1	Therefore, the Partnership is only subject to income taxes on this investment to the extent it receives dividends from the subsidiaries.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P66_S0	The VIEs which are reported on a consolidated basis with the Partnership for GAAP reporting purposes as described below under Effect of Implementation of Guidance Changes on Consolidations on Financial Reporting are separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P66_S1	The Partnership does not presently believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP will impact the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to unitholders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P67_S0	The Partnership is required to consolidate the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of certain entities that meet the definition of a VIE into the Partnership's financial statements under the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P67_S1	Management has determined that six of the entities which own multifamily apartment properties financed by the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P67_S2	Because management determined that the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of each of these VIEs pursuant to the terms of each tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and the criteria within the consolidation guidance, the Partnership consolidated the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these VIEs' multifamily properties into the Partnership's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P67_S3	Transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the consolidated VIEs, including the indebtedness underlying the tax-exempt mortgage bonds and taxable loans secured by the properties owned by the VIEs, have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P68_S0	All financial information in this Form 10-K presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, is that of the Partnership and the VIEs on a consolidated basis.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P68_S1	We refer to the Partnership, its wholly owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ), and the consolidated VIEs throughout this Form 10-K as the Company .
1059142_11_ITEM1_P68_S2	We refer to the Partnership and Holding Company, without consolidation of the VIEs, as the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P69_S0	We are a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P69_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P70_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage securities and multifamily real estate properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P71_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S0	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S2	In connection with the operation of the Partnership, our general partner is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments and taxable mortgage loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S3	Ten of the tax-exempt revenue bonds held by the Partnership provide for the payment of this administrative fee to the general partner by the owner of the financed property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S4	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the tax-exempt revenue bond on that property.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S5	Our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P72_S6	In addition, our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the general partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P73_S0	Our general partner or its affiliates may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P73_S1	Any mortgage placement fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P73_S2	The amount of mortgage placement fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between the general partner or its affiliates and such property owners.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P74_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of apartment complexes.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P74_S1	Properties Management currently manages the eight MF Properties and nine of the properties whose tax-exempt bonds are held by the Partnership and earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P74_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of apartment complexes financed by additional mortgage bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P74_S3	If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P75_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P76_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P77_S0	The Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_11_ITEM1_P77_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Partnership are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Cash distributions from the Partnership may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Beginning with the distribution for the second quarter 2009, the Partnership's annual distribution was reduced from $0.54 per unit to $0.50 per unit due to the General Partner's determination that higher borrowing costs and other factors would reduce the cash available to the Partnership to make distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P2_S2	If the Partnership's actual results of operations vary from current projections and the actual cash generated is less than the new regular distribution, the Partnership may need to reduce the distribution rate further.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of units.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying apartment complex and is secured by a first mortgage lien on the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, except in limited cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other apartment complexes, mortgage rates for single-family housing and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our bonds are located, there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The principal of most of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Similarly, if a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying multifamily property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will suffer a loss.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In the event a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The taxable mortgage loans that we make to owners of the apartment properties that secure tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable loans than on the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these taxable loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, the Partnership does not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable mortgage loan if the property is not in default on the tax-exempt bonds financing the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future tax-exempt bond financings of these projects.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell in a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our plan is to provide tax-exempt mortgage financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Current credit market and general economic conditions have had a significant negative effect on the market for LIHTC syndications and, as a result, few LIHTC syndications are being completed at this time.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For this and other reasons, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to sell its interests in the MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the value of the Partnership's interest in MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, there is no assurance the Partnership will not incur a loss upon the sale of its interest in an MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire tax-exempt bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties in connection with the syndication of new LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P17_S5	During the time the Partnership owns an interest in an MF Property, any net income it receives from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The interest that we pay on this financing fluctuates with a specific interest rate index.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P19_S2	All of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P19_S3	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders and may affect the market value of our units.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P20_S0	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of our tax-exempt mortgage bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P20_S1	A decrease in the value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P21_S0	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new tax exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of tax-exempt bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P21_S1	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt bonds through the issuance of additional units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing tax-exempt bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S0	We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, to mitigate the risks we are exposed to as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S1	However, there is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S2	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and there is no assurance these costs will not ultimately turn out to exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S3	There is also a risk that a counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S4	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S5	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P23_S6	This can result in significant period to period volatility in the Partnership's reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P24_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our tax-exempt bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P25_S1	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require that we deposit tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P25_S2	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable rate.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P25_S3	As the holder of the residual interest, the Partnership is entitled to any remaining tax-exempt interest received by the trust after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents and liquidity providers.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Specific risks generally associated with these bond securitization programs include the following:
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of a bond securitization financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P28_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on a specified index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P28_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying tax-exempt bond interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less tax-exempt bond interest available to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the Partnership's return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and no party guarantees the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The residual interests in a trust or other special purpose entity used for these types of financing are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P31_S0	paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P31_S1	The holder of a residual certificate in such a trust can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P31_S2	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Termination of a bond securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause the Partnership to lose the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral it pledged for such financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S0	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for a bond securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the bonds or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Problems with the bonds that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying bonds, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S3	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S4	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then the Partnership will be required, through its guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P33_S5	As a result, the Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose its investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P34_S0	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair the Partnership's ability to recover the tax-exempt bonds and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In the event the sponsor of a bond securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P35_S1	In that situation, it is possible that the Partnership would not be able to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds it pledged in connection with the bond securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by the Partnership in such trust or other entity.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Significantly tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth were experienced in 2010 and continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, restricted availability of credit, declining residential and commercial real estate markets, volatile energy prices, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to the economic downturn and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P37_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P38_S1	As a result, our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P38_S2	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The majority of our assets consist of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S5	As a result, our ability to sell our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P40_S6	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P42_S0	All of the apartment properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P42_S3	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P42_S4	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner's ability to service its debt.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The properties financed by certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Five of the multifamily housing properties financed by tax-exempt bonds held by the Partnership are located in areas that are prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P44_S1	The current insurable value of these five properties is approximately $78.1 million.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property's value.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the five properties financed by the Partnership that are located in areas rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a 5% deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P45_S2	As a result, if any of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property and this could result in a default on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P45_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P47_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P48_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P48_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P49_S0	If we acquire ownership of apartment properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may acquire ownership of apartment complexes financed by tax-exempt bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these apartment properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P50_S2	In either case, during the time we own an apartment complex, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates and increases in operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P50_S4	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership's financial results and ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of multifamily apartment properties that may affect the tax-exempt bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may invest in tax-exempt revenue bonds secured by multifamily housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P54_S0	governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P54_S1	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the tax-exempt bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our tax-exempt bond on the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our tax-exempt bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable loan.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S3	Any return on this additional investment would not be tax-exempt.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive tax-exempt interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P55_S5	The overall return to the Partnership from its investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P56_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the tax-exempt bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We may acquire tax-exempt revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P57_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P57_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P57_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We have assumed certain potential liability relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The Partnership has acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P59_S1	When the Partnership acquires an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after the Partnership acquired its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P59_S2	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Any future issuances of additional units could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The Partnership may issue additional units from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing units and a decrease in the market price of the units.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P61_S2	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The Partnership is not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because it operates under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P64_S0	The Partnership engages in transactions with related parties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P65_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as the General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P65_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for many of the multifamily apartment properties that underlie our tax-exempt bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P66_S0	of the Partnership and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P66_S2	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm's length.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P66_S3	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is determined to be taxable.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P68_S3	If the IRS were to determine that tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We have obtained legal opinions to the effect that the base interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes provided the interest is not paid to a substantial user or related person as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P69_S1	However, these legal opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurances can be given that the conclusions reached will not be contested by the IRS or, if contested, will be sustained by a court.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt status of the interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is subject to compliance by the underlying properties, and the owners thereof, with the bond documents and covenants required by the bond-issuing authority and the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P69_S3	Among these requirements are tenant income restrictions, regulatory agreement compliance, reporting requirements, use of proceeds restrictions and compliance with rules pertaining to interest arbitrage.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Each issuer of the revenue bonds, as well as each of the underlying property owners/borrowers, has agreed to comply with procedures and guidelines designed to ensure satisfaction with the continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Failure to comply with these continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may cause the interest on our bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, if we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through bond securitization programs in which we place tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds into trusts and are entitled to a share of the tax-exempt interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interests on senior securities issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Not all of the income received by the Partnership is exempt from taxation.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P72_S0	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable mortgage loans to the owners of properties which are secured by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The interest income earned by the Partnership on these mortgage loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P72_S2	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclose of a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or a taxable loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In that case, the taxable income received by the Partnership will be allocated to our unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If the Partnership was determined to be an association taxable as corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for the Partnership and its unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The Partnership has made an election to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P74_S1	The purpose of this election is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for the Partnership and allow us to pass through our tax-exempt interest to our unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P74_S2	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P74_S3	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders being treated as taxable ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Partnership's earnings and profits, which would include tax-exempt income.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P74_S4	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The listing of the Partnership's units for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market causes the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P76_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P76_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends and certain other items.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Substantially all of the Partnership's gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on mortgage bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P76_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P77_S0	qualifying income, the Partnership will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P77_S1	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P78_S0	To the extent the Partnership generates taxable income; unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P79_S0	As a partnership, our unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by the Partnership, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P80_S0	There are limits on the ability of our unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_11_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The ability of unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by the Partnership will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is collateralized by a multifamily housing property.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the first mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P1_S0	As a result of the guidance on consolidations, the Company is required to consolidate certain of the multifamily residential properties securing its bonds because the owners of those properties are treated as Consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Company consolidated six multifamily housing properties owned by VIEs located in Florida, South Carolina, and Texas as of December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM2_P1_S2	The Partnership does not hold title to the properties owned by the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition to the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs, the Company reports the financial results of the MF Properties on a consolidated basis due to the 99% limited partnership interests held by its subsidiary in the partnerships that own the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P2_S1	The Company consolidated eight MF Properties located in Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina as of December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM2_P2_S2	Three of these properties ("Ohio Properties") are subject to a sales agreement that does not meet the criteria for derecognition and full accrual accounting treatment under the guidance for real estate sales.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P2_S3	As a result, the Company continues to consolidate these Ohio Properties as if they were owned.
1059142_11_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for each of the consolidated properties as of December 31, 2010 :
1059142_11_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the properties collateralizing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are subject.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P0_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P0_S1	The rights and obligations of unitholders are set forth in the Partnership's Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P1_S0	BUCs of the Partnership trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol "ATAX".
1059142_11_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the BUCs for each quarterly period from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM5_P2_S0	The approximate number of unitholders on December 31, 2010 was 7,600.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distributions to unitholders were made on a quarterly basis during 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 .
1059142_11_ITEM5_P3_S1	Total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 were approximately $13,574,000, $10,864,000, and $9,140,000, respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P4_S0	(d) The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 were as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM5_P5_S0	See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for information regarding the sources of funds that will be used for cash distributions and for a discussion of factors which may adversely affect the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions at the same levels in 2010 and thereafter.
1059142_11_ITEM5_P6_S0	(f) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P0_S0	Set forth below is selected financial data for the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2006 through 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in response to Item 8 of this report.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P0_S2	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and its effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K:
1059142_11_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, Tier 2 income due to the general partner (as defined in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative income or expense (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, impairments on assets, deferred gain and related interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P2_S0	The Company uses CAD as a supplemental measurement of its ability to pay distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P2_S1	The Company believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P3_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P3_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership's operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P3_S2	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P3_S3	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P4_S0	The following sets forth a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and the Partnership's CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S2	For the year ended 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio partnerships generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier II income.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S3	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove, and from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S4	For 2008, Lake Forest generated approximately $45,000, Fairmont Oaks generated approximately $54,000, and Iona Lakes generated approximately $54,000 of Tier 2 income.
1059142_11_ITEM6_P5_S5	For 2007, Lake Forest generated approximately $231,000 of Tier 2 income.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Partnership refers to America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries which consist of:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P1_S0	Five multifamily apartments owned by various limited partnerships in which Partnership subsidiaries hold a 99% limited partner interest and three multifamily apartment properties owned by various limited partnerships which are subject to a sales agreement (the MF Properties ) - see Note 6.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P2_S0	The Company refers to the consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K which include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Partnership, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and six other consolidated entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary ( Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P2_S1	All significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P3_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P3_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P3_S2	All of the Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P3_S3	The Company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies because they involve judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P3_S4	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS Financing (see Note 9) and has determined that the securitization transaction does not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P5_S0	In accordance with the guidance which outlines the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset, in part, the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either of the following:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P6_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P6_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P6_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P7_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P7_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P7_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P8_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of the consolidation guidance.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P8_S1	As part of the TEBS Financing certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P8_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P8_S3	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P9_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P10_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P10_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P10_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P11_S0	The Partnership also considered the related party relationship of the entities involved in the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P11_S1	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P12_S0	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing on the ATAX TEBS I, LLC balance sheet and all activities associated with the TEBS Financing are presented with the results of the ATAX TEBS I, LLC operations.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P13_S0	As noted above, ATAX TEBS I, LLC is a Consolidated Subsidiary of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P14_S0	The Partnership invests in federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P14_S1	The Partnership owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P14_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P14_S3	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P15_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new provisions of the consolidation guidance that amended the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and required enhanced disclosure to provide more information about the Company's involvement in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P16_S0	The Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P17_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack: i. the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights; ii.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P17_S1	the obligation to absorb the expected loss of the entity; or iii.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P17_S2	the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P18_S0	The revised accounting standard introduces a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P18_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P18_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership has re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P18_S3	The guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S0	The Partnership has determined that, as of January 1, 2010, six of the entities financed by tax-exempt bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S1	These VIEs are Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S2	Additionally, in January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default on two bond holdings, DeCordova and Weatherford, and began foreclosure procedures.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S3	The foreclosure on these bonds was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S4	Simultaneous with the foreclosure, the properties were acquired through the assumption of liabilities by new ownership and the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership became the obligations of the new owners.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S5	Prior to the foreclosure and ownership transfer the owners of these properties were not considered VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P19_S6	Based on the foreclosures and the lack of sufficient equity investment at risk by the new owners, these entities were determined to be Consolidated VIEs in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P20_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P20_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities' ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P21_S0	Under the prior consolidation standards, the Partnership consolidated Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest as it held the majority of the variable interests in these VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P21_S1	Under the revised standards, the Partnership has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of four of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P21_S2	As a result of adopting the new guidance on January 1, 2010, the Partnership no longer reports Ashley Square and Cross Creek on a consolidated basis.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S0	As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S1	The Company owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S3	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S5	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P22_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P23_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P24_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S1	At December 31, 2010 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 7.2% to 8.7%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S3	Assuming an immediate 10 percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 7.9% to 9.6% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $8.4 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P25_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P26_S0	The estimated future cash flow of each revenue bond depends on the operations of the underlying property and, therefore, is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts, future real estate operating expenses, and future capital expenditures.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P26_S1	Such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the property operates, the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets, and tax and insurance expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P26_S2	Different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may provide different results.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P27_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P28_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P29_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P29_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P30_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P30_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P31_S0	The inputs to these models require management to make numerous subjective assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P32_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P33_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P34_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P34_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P35_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P36_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P37_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P37_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P37_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P38_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P38_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P38_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P38_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P39_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P40_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P41_S0	Evaluation of property loans for potential losses - In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P41_S1	These loans are collateral dependent with the repayment of the loans being dependent on the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P41_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P41_S3	The Company estimates the fair value of the property and compares the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P42_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property's fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P42_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P42_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property's fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P43_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P43_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P44_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P45_S0	Revenue recognition - tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds - Interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is payable solely from the net cash flow of the underlying properties and reserve funds, if any, set aside pursuant to the bond documents.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P45_S1	These bonds are not the obligations of the state or local housing authorities that issued them and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P46_S0	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P46_S1	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P46_S2	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P46_S3	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P46_S4	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P47_S0	Revenue Recognition - investments in real estate - The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 6) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P47_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P48_S0	The Partnership's investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P48_S1	The guidance requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their fair values.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P48_S2	In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, derivative instruments must be appropriately designated, documented and proven to be effective as a hedge.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P48_S3	The Partnership did not designate its current derivatives as qualifying hedges.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P49_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P49_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P49_S2	The fair value adjustment through earnings can cause a significant fluctuation in reported net income although it has no impact on the Partnership's cash flows.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P50_S0	Although the Company utilizes current price quotes by recognized dealers as a basis for estimating the fair value of its interest rate derivative agreements, the calculation of the fair value involves a considerable degree of judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S0	The Partnership operates for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S1	Each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S2	The Partnership does not hold an ownership interest in any of these entities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S3	However, in some cases, these entities are treated as VIEs and, as a result, the assets, liabilities and financial results of the properties owned by these entities are consolidated with the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S4	Whether or not treated as a VIE, the owners of the properties financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership have an operating goal to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to service their debt on the Partnership's bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P51_S5	In order to achieve this goal, management of these multifamily apartment properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of the properties in their respective market areas.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S0	On December 31, 2010 , the Partnership owned 21 federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $189.3 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 21 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 4,042 rental units located in the states of Florida, Iowa, South Carolina, Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Illinois, and Ohio, one multifamily residential apartment complex under construction in Texas that will contain a total of 76 rental units, and a 142-bed student housing facility in Nebraska.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S3	Each bond is secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S4	Of the 21 bonds owned, eight are owned directly by the Partnership and 13 are owned by ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S5	Six of the entities that own the apartment properties financed by six of the Partnership's tax exempt bonds were deemed to be Consolidated VIEs of the Partnership at December 31, 2010 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S6	Additionally, two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties subject to a sales agreement (see Note 6 and below) are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S7	Additionally, six of the bonds also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P52_S8	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P53_S0	The six Consolidated VIE multifamily apartment properties as of December 31, 2010, contained a total of 1,152 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P53_S1	As of December 31, 2009, six of the 17 tax-exempt mortgage bonds owned by the Partnership were secured by properties held as VIEs which contained 1,288 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P53_S2	The properties underlying the thirteen non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage bonds contain a total of 2,144 rental units at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P53_S3	Two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units are subject to a sales agreement (see Note 6) and are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P53_S4	As of December 31, 2009, the properties underlying the 11 non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage bonds contain a total of 1,497 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional tax exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, the Partnership may acquire ownership positions in apartment properties ( MF Properties ), in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through a sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S1	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S3	The Partnership expects to provide the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S4	Such restructurings will generally be expected to be initiated within 36 months of the Partnership's investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P54_S5	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P55_S0	In June 2010, the Partnership completed the first planned restructuring by investing in two Ohio tax exempt bonds, collateralized by three existing Ohio MF properties, with a total of 362 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P55_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the Series A bond with a par value of $14.7 million and the Series B bond with a par value of $3.6 million issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P55_S2	The new owners have not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company has effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P55_S3	As such, the transaction does not meet accounting standards for derecognition and full accrual accounting treatment under the guidance for real estate sales and the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if they were owned with the bonds being eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P56_S0	Cash received as part of the sale transaction represents a deferred gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million (see Note 6).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P57_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries held limited partnership interests in five entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 602 rental units together with the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units which are subject to a sales agreement.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P57_S1	As of December 31, 2009, the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries held limited partnership interests in nine MF Properties containing a total of 964 units.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P57_S2	The MF Properties' operating goal is similar to that of the properties underlying the Partnership's tax-exempt bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P58_S0	Twelve of the 21 properties which collateralize the bonds owned by the Partnership are managed by America First Properties Management Company ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of AFCA 2, which provides property management services for Ashley Square, Iona Lakes Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments, Lake Forest Apartments, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Cross Creek, Clarkson College, Woodland Park, DeCordova, and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P58_S1	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P58_S2	The properties not currently managed by Properties Management are Autumn Pines, Bella Vista Apartments, Brookstone Apartments, Runnymede Apartments, Bridle Ridge, South Park Ranch Apartments, Villages at Lost Creek and Woodlynn Village.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P58_S3	Weatherford is currently under construction and not subject to a management agreement.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S1	The gross proceeds from TEBS Financing were approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses the Company received net proceeds from the TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S3	The Company applied approximately $49.5 million of these net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, its secured term loan from Bank of America.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S4	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S5	Under the TEBS Financing, the Company securitized the bonds by transferring certain assets to Freddie Mac in exchange for tax-exempt Class A and Class B Freddie Mac Multifamily Variable Rate Certificates (collectively, the TEBS Certificates ) issued by Freddie Mac.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S6	The TEBS Certificates represent beneficial interests in the securitized assets held by Freddie Mac.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S7	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain Facility Fees.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S8	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.25% and the total Facility Fees were 1.9%, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 2.15%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S9	As of December 31, 2010, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.34% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.24%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S10	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Company is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P59_S11	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the TEBS Financing is presented by the Company as a secured financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S1	Prior to the closing of the TEBS Financing, the Company had outstanding debt financing of $54.8 million consisting of two credit facilities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S2	The first credit facility was with Bank of America and had an outstanding balance of $49.3 million (the BOA Facility ).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S3	As noted above, the BOA Facility was repaid with proceeds from the TEBS Financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S4	The second credit facility was with Omaha State Bank and had an outstanding balance of $5.5 million (the OSB Facility ).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P60_S5	The OSB Facility was repaid prior to the execution of the TEBS Financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P61_S0	The TEBS Financing offers several advantages over the Company's previous credit facilities which, over time, are expected to positively impact the generation of CAD.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P62_S0	a lower initial cost of borrowing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P63_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting restrictions on the availability of debt financing that had prevailed since 2008 began to subside in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P63_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has increased significantly from two years ago, overall availability remains limited and the cost of credit may continue to be adversely impacted.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P63_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P64_S0	Many participants in the multifamily housing debt sector either reduced their participation in the market or were forced to liquidate some or all of their existing portfolio investments in order to meet their liquidity needs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P64_S1	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P64_S2	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P64_S3	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P65_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P65_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P65_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of tax-exempt bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional tax-exempt housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S4	In addition, the economic conditions including higher levels of unemployment, lack of job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy during the past two years.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S5	Overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 81% during 2010 compared to 84% during 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S6	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has remained at approximately 83% during both years 2010 and 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S7	These issues may continue to negatively affect property operations and profitability in the short-term.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P66_S8	We expect that property operations will improve in 2011 and 2012 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will be positive.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P97_S0	Woodland Park - The Partnership has identified circumstances which indicate that certain actions may be necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder of the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable lender.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P97_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , Woodland Park owes the Partnership approximately $15.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and approximately $914,000 under taxable loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P97_S2	The construction of Woodland Park was completed in November 2008 and lease-up continues, however, the property has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P97_S3	Additionally, there were insufficient funds on deposit with the bond trustee to make the debt service payment of approximately $452,000 on the bonds which was due on May 3, 2010 and the property owner did not provide additional capital to fund the shortfall.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P98_S0	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and started the foreclosure process.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P98_S1	The foreclosure process is expected to be complete in the first half of 2011.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P98_S2	This action will allow a new property owner to re-syndicate the LIHTCs associated with this property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P98_S3	If the LIHTCs can be successfully re-syndicated, it will provide additional capital to the project which can be used to support debt service payments on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds until property operations improve to the point that sufficient cash is generated to pay any past due amounts on the bonds as well as ongoing debt service.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P98_S4	If the re-syndication is not successful the Partnership may pursue other options including making additional taxable loans to the property or completing the foreclosure process and taking direct ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S0	The Partnership believes that the most significant issue in the slow lease-up of the property and its failure to achieve stabilization has been the 100% set aside of the rental units for tenants that make less than 60% of the area median income.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S1	At the request of the Partnership, in April 2010, the property owner reduced the number of units set aside for affordable tenants to 75% and began leasing 59 units to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S2	Additionally, the property owner has agreed that, if needed to stabilize the property, it would further reduce the units set aside for affordable tenants to 60% thereby making an additional 35 units available to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S3	As of December 31, 2009, the property had 116 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 49% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S4	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 190 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 81% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P99_S5	Based on the level of leasing activity resulting from the change in the mix of affordable and market rate tenants, the Partnership continues to believe that Woodland is capable of reaching stabilization.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P100_S0	The Partnership has evaluated this bond holding, as part of the evaluation of its entire investment portfolio, for an other-than-temporary decline in value as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P100_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of this bond existed at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P101_S0	Our ability to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P102_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P102_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P102_S2	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principle and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P102_S3	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate which is equal to the stated rate on the bonds as they were purchased at par in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P103_S0	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions the most significant of which include:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P104_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P105_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P106_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P106_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P107_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P108_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P109_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P109_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P109_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P110_S0	The various revenue and expense projections for this property's operations are summarized as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P111_S0	Woodland Park - Revenue and expenses for model year one (2011) are equal to the property budget.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P111_S1	Budgeted revenues of approximately $1.7 million are based on a budgeted average occupancy of 88%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P111_S2	Revenues are projected to grow over the ten years in the model to approximately $2.2 million in year ten based on average annual rental increases of 2% and an average occupancy increasing over time to 93%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P111_S3	Expenses are projected to grow to approximately $1.0 million in year ten based on average annual increases of 2.5%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P112_S0	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond held by the Company, a taxable loan has been made to the owners of this property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P112_S1	The Partnership has evaluated this taxable property loan for potential impairment as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P113_S0	The repayment of this loan is dependent largely on the value of the property which collateralizes the loan.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P113_S1	The Company periodically evaluates the loan for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralizes the loan.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P114_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we consider a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P114_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P114_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P114_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P115_S0	In estimating the property valuation for the current year, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as discussed above except that the specific discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was approximately 6.5% which the Partnership believes represents a rate at which a multifamily property could obtain current tax-exempt financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P116_S0	In addition to the discounted cash flow models utilized to estimate the property valuation, the Company obtained an independent appraisal for this property in February 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P116_S1	Based on the results of the discounted cash flow model and an evaluation of the appraisal the Partnership has estimated the property value for Woodland Park which collateralizes the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and the taxable loan to be approximately $16.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P117_S0	Based on this estimated property valuation and after subtracting the amortized cost of the tax-exempt bond, the Partnership recorded an allowance for loan loss of approximately $700,000 in 2009 and an additional allowance of approximately $200,000 in 2010 to reserve for the entire taxable loan balance due from Woodland Park.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P117_S1	The Partnership will continue to monitor this investment for changes in circumstances that might warrant an impairment charge.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P118_S0	The owners of the following properties have been determined to meet the definition of a VIE and the Partnership has been determined to be the Primary Beneficiary.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P118_S1	As a result, the Company reports the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S0	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership are traditional 80/20 bonds issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S1	These bonds require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S2	The bond has an outstanding principal amount of $7.7 million and has a base interest rate of 6.25% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S3	The bond also provides for contingent interest payable from excess cash flow generated by the underlying property through the potential payment of contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S4	The bond accrues contingent interest at a rate of 1.9% annually and such contingent interest is payable only if the underlying property generates excess operating cash flows or realizes excess cash through capital appreciation and a related sale or refinancing of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P120_S5	To date, the property has not paid any contingent interest and the Partnership has not recognized any contingent interest income related to this bond.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P127_S0	Residences at DeCordova and Residences at Weatherford are bond holdings for which these ownership entities meet the Consolidated VIE definition.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P127_S1	Based on an accumulation of individual circumstances, the Partnership has identified that DeCordova and Weatherford's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are in a position for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P127_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , DeCordova owes the Partnership approximately $4.9 million under tax-exempt bonds and $648,000 under taxable loans and Weatherford owes the Partnership approximately $4.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and $1.1 million under taxable loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P127_S3	The following is a discussion of the circumstances related to each of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P127_S4	As both of these entities meet the Consolidated VIE definition the bonds discussed below are eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P128_S0	The construction of Residences at DeCordova was completed in April 2009 and lease-up continues, however, the property has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P128_S1	As result of the failure to reach stabilization, the bond is in technical default.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P129_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 65 units leased out of total available units of 76, or 86% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P130_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Granbury, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P130_S1	The Partnership believes the most significant issue in the slow lease-up of the property is the current single family housing market in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P130_S2	Many potential tenants must first sell their existing home before they are able to move into a rental unit.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S0	In September 2009, the Partnership was notified by the tax credit limited partner of the owner of Residences at DeCordova of its intent to withdraw from the limited partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S1	In January 2010, the Partnership concluded its best course of action for the removal of the current limited partner was to issue a Notice of Default through the bond trustee and to begin foreclosure procedures.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S2	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S3	Through this process the Partnership removed the limited partner which will allow the property owner to re-syndicate the LIHTCs to a new limited partner thereby providing additional capital to the project.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S4	The underwriting estimate of LIHTCs to be generated by this property that would be available for re-syndication is approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S5	The syndication of the LIHTCs, at an amount less than the gross credits generated, would provide additional capital for the project in the form of new limited partner equity.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P131_S6	The Partnership believes that, if this can be accomplished, such new equity would be sufficient to allow for the current bonds to remain in place and operations be funded through an extended lease-up period.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P132_S0	The property continued to experience slow lease-up and was unable to re-syndicate the LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P132_S1	As a result, in December 2010, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P132_S2	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P132_S3	At this time the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P133_S0	leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment in DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P134_S0	Residences at Weatherford are currently under construction and will contain 76 units upon completion.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P135_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Weatherford, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P135_S1	At this time infrastructure construction activities have been substantially completed but no construction has begun on the actual apartment buildings.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S0	In January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default through the bond trustee and began foreclosure procedures to remove the limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S1	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S2	At that time the general partner was allowed to continue in that capacity and a new limited partner was admitted.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S3	The foreclosure was a reconsideration event under the variable interest entity guidance and as a result of the reevaluation, the bond was eliminated and the entity that owns the property was consolidated as a VIE effective in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S4	Through this process the Partnership anticipated that the new property owner would recapitalize the property by pursuing an alternative plan of financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S5	Specifically, the Partnership worked with the general partner of the owner to identify available Tax Credit Assistance Program ( TCAP ) funding through application to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs ( TDHCA ).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S6	In March 2010, a TCAP Written Agreement with TDHCA was approved and entered into which committed TCAP funds to the project pending the completion of formal agreements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S7	Formal agreements and funding were originally expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2010; however, the process was delayed due to the large number of transactions to be closed by TDHCA.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S8	During the delay TDHCA identified certain issues in funding and compliance with other projects in which the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford is involved.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S9	As a result of these issues, in October 2010, TDHCA issued a Notice of Termination of TCAP Funding to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S10	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S11	Based on the termination notice, the Company has determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S12	As of December 31, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P136_S13	The resulting impairment charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $3.3 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P137_S0	As a result of the failure of the property owner to secure an alternative plan of financing, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P137_S1	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P137_S2	The Partnership has taken over the project and intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the project.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P137_S3	Upon the completion of construction the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P137_S4	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment in Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Partnership evaluated the DeCordova bond, as part of the evaluation of its entire investment portfolio, for an other-than-temporary decline in value as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P138_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of the DeCordova bond existed at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P139_S0	As noted above, the Weatherford bond and related taxable loan were written down in third quarter, 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P140_S0	The process and models utilized by the Company to evaluate bonds for impairment is described above.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P140_S1	The various revenue and expense projections utilized in the valuation model for DeCordova are summarized as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P141_S0	Revenue and expenses for model year one (2011) are equal to the property budget.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P141_S1	Budgeted revenues of approximately $580,000 are based on a budgeted average occupancy of 90%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P141_S2	Revenues are projected to grow over the ten years in the model to approximately $710,000 in year ten based on average annual rental increases of 2% and an average occupancy increasing over time to 93%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P141_S3	Expenses are projected to grow to approximately $307,000 in year ten based on average annual increases of 2.5%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P142_S0	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond held by the Company, taxable loans have been made to the owners of DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Partnership has evaluated these taxable property loans for potential impairment as of December 31, 2010 as described above (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P142_S2	Based on the results of the discounted cash flow model and an evaluation of an appraisal completed in 2010, the Partnership has estimated the property value for the DeCordova property collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and the taxable loans at $5.9 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P143_S0	Based on this estimated property valuation and after subtracting the amortized cost of the tax-exempt bonds, the Partnership has concluded there is no impairment of the taxable loans made to DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P143_S1	The Partnership will continue to monitor these investments for changes in circumstances that might warrant an impairment charge.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P144_S0	The Partnership holds an indirect 99% interest in the owners of each of the following properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P144_S1	These properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $10.6 million at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P144_S2	There are no tax-exempt bonds currently secured by these properties.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S3	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S4	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 10.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S5	Both series of bonds mature in June 2050.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S6	The Company had previously acquired a 99% interest in the Ohio Properties as part of its strategy of acquiring existing multifamily apartment properties that it expects will be partially financed with new tax-exempt mortgage bonds at the time the properties become eligible for the issuance of additional low-income housing tax credits.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S7	In addition to the new tax-exempt bonds acquired by the Company, the plan of financing for the acquisition included other subordinated debt issued by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S8	The new owners ultimately plan to sell limited partnership interests in the properties and syndicate LIHTCs as part of the overall plan of finance.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P150_S9	The new owners have not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company has effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S0	Pursuant to Property, Plant, and Equipment - Real Estate Sales guidance the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for derecognition of the properties or full accrual accounting for the gain.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S1	The guidance requires sufficient equity capital as part of a sales transaction to indicate a commitment from the buyer (typically a minimum of 3 to 5% investment by the new owners).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S2	As the buyer has no equity capital in this transaction and the property operations are the current support for the debt service, the Company, in substance, remains the owner for accounting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S3	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S4	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S5	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P151_S6	The properties will continue to be presented as MF Properties and no gain will be recognized until such time as the transaction meets the criteria for derecognition of the properties and gain recognition (See Note 5 and 6).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P152_S0	The following is a discussion of the operating results for the three Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P153_S0	Crescent Village - Crescent Village Townhomes is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and contains 90 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P153_S1	The consolidation of Crescent Village's operations resulted in recognition by the Company of net operating income of $146,000 and $366,000 on net revenue of approximately $726,000 and $749,000 in 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P153_S2	The decrease in net operating income is the result of decreased occupancy along with an increase in utility and administration expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P153_S3	Crescent Village also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P154_S0	Post Woods - Post Woods Townhomes is located in Reynoldsburg, Ohio and contains 180 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P154_S1	The consolidation of Post Woods' operations resulted in the recognition by the Company of net operating income of $344,000 and $683,000 on net revenue of approximately $1.4 million and $1.4 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P154_S2	The decrease in net operating income is a result of an increase in advertising and utilities expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P154_S3	Post Woods also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P155_S0	Willow Bend - Willow Bend Townhomes is located in Columbus (Hilliard), Ohio and contains 92 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P155_S1	The consolidation of Willow Bend's operations resulted in recognition by the Company of net operating income of $157,000 and $343,000 on net revenue of approximately $776,000 and $795,000 in 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P155_S2	The decrease in net operating income is the result of decreased economic occupancy and increased utility expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P155_S3	Willow Bend also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P156_S0	The tables below compare the results of operations for the Company for 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 :
1059142_11_ITEM7_P157_S0	Property revenues of the Company consist of those of the MF Properties as well as the six Consolidated VIEs treated as continuing operations during the periods.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P157_S1	Property revenues decreased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly as a result of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments no longer being reported as Consolidated VIEs in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P158_S0	properties were included in property revenues reported by the Company in 2010 compared to approximately $1.5 million of property revenues from these properties that were reported in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P158_S1	The decline in property revenue due to the deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek was partially offset by an increase of approximately $300,000 in property revenues generated by Residences at DeCordova which became a Consolidated VIE on March 1, 2010 and general improvements in economic occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P158_S2	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties increased to $7,295 per unit in 2010 from $7,119 in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P158_S3	The annual net rental revenues per unit related to the Consolidated VIEs increased to approximately $6,920 in 2010 from approximately $6,216 in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income of the Company consists of the interest income earned only on the mortgage revenue bonds that were not issued to finance properties owned by Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S1	The deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments increased investment income by approximately $962,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S2	These properties are no longer treated as Consolidated VIEs as of January 1, 2010, therefore the interest paid to the Company on the tax-exempt bonds is no longer eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S3	In addition, the Company realized additional tax-exempt interest income of approximately $1.9 million due to the acquisition of four tax-exempt bonds, South Park Ranch Apartments, Brookstone Apartments, Villages at Lost Creek, and Autumn Pines that were not owned during 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S4	These increases were offset by interest income from Residences at DeCordova and Residences at Weatherford which became Consolidated VIEs on March 1, 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S5	The interest income related to these bonds is now eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P159_S6	The elimination of DeCordova and Weatherford interest in 2010 totaled approximately $478,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P160_S0	Gain on assets held for sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P160_S1	In September 2009, the Partnership sold the Oak Grove Commons apartments, an asset held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for $3.75 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P160_S2	After the deduction of selling expenses, commissions, and cash advances made to the property, the Partnership realized a taxable gain of approximately $863,000 from the sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P160_S3	There was no similar transaction in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P161_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P161_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P161_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P161_S3	There was no similar transaction in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P162_S0	Other income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P162_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P163_S0	When comparing 2010 to 2009, a decrease of approximately $1.3 million in real estate operating expenses is the result of the Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments deconsolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P163_S1	This decrease was offset by approximately $428,000 of expenses related to the consolidation of Residences at DeCordova and Residences at Weatherford, an increase of approximately $231,000 in administrative fees, and an increase of approximately $376,000 of acquisition related costs incurred by the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P163_S2	The acquisition costs incurred in 2010 by the Ohio Property owners represent expenses of non-controlling interests.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P163_S3	In addition, there were increases in MF Property related market ready, insurance, and salary expense .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates its investments for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P164_S1	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of value to support the investment carrying values.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S0	Investments tested for impairment include all fixed assets, bond investments and taxable loans made to various properties and other amounts due to the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S1	Such evaluation is based on cash flow and discounted cash flow models.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S2	The Company concluded that there was no impairment of fixed assets or bond investments as of December 31, 2010, except for the Residences of Weatherford as discussed below.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S3	This evaluation determined that a portion of the taxable property loans was potentially impaired and that an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S4	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $212,000 and $700,000 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S5	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2010, $350,000 was recorded as an allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss against the cross collateralized Ashley Square and Cross Creek taxable loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P165_S6	In 2009 the Company recorded a $700,000 allowance for bad debt against the judgment receivable related to the 2008 foreclosure on the Prairiebrook Village bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P166_S0	the Company has determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P166_S1	As of September 30, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership were written down.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P166_S2	The resulting impairment charge of approximately $2.5 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P166_S3	In February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership and will continue to develop the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P167_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties, and deferred finance cost amortization written off upon retirement of the BOA Credit Facility in addition to new amortization of finance costs related to the closing of the TEBS Credit Facility.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P167_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to a decrease of approximately $96,000 in deferred financing cost amortization, a decrease of approximately $708,000 in in-place lease amortization, and an approximate $581,000 decrease due to deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P167_S2	These were offset by a depreciation expense increase of approximately $200,000 due the consolidation of Residences at DeCordova and an increase of approximately $177,000 due to depreciation on assets added to the existing MF Properties and Consolidated VIEs during 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P168_S0	The decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P168_S1	Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was a result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P168_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P168_S3	The remaining change in interest expense results from changes in the average outstanding debt throughout the year combined with changes in the Company's cost of borrowing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P168_S4	The average outstanding debt decreased slightly while the average cost of borrowing increased slightly from approximately 3.5% per annum in 2009 to approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P169_S0	General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to increased professional fees and administration fees.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P169_S1	Professional fees increased approximately $258,000 due mainly to accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with the process the Company utilized to respond to a comment letter received by the Company from the Securities Exchange Commission in the first quarter of 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P169_S2	Additional professional fees were also incurred for accounting consultation regarding the implementation of new accounting standards in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P169_S3	Administration fees paid to AFCA 2 increased approximately $335,000 as the Company has a higher level of invested assets and taxable loans in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P169_S4	Offsetting these expenses was a reduction in reimbursable employee related costs paid to AFCA 2.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S0	Property revenues of the Company consist of those of the MF Properties as well as the six VIEs treated as continuing operations during the periods.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S1	Property revenues increased approximately $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S2	Approximately $2.3 million is attributable to the acquisition of the Commons at Churchland and Glynn Place Apartments acquired in the second half of 2008 and Greens of Pine Glen, acquired in the first quarter of 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S3	Property revenues for the VIEs reported a net decrease of approximately $317,000 due to reduced occupancy at existing VIEs offset by approximately $248,000 of increased revenues from a new VIE, Cross Creek Apartments, acquired in the second quarter 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S4	The remaining decrease in Property revenues is the result of a decline in Economic Occupancy at the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S5	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties decreased to $7,119 per unit in 2009 from $7,667 in 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P170_S6	The annual net rental revenues per unit related to the VIEs decreased to approximately $6,216 in 2009 from approximately $7,664 in 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P171_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income of the Company consists of the interest income earned only on the mortgage revenue bonds that were not issued to finance properties owned by VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P171_S1	Mortgage revenue bond investment income was flat year over year due to offsetting factors.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P171_S2	Income from three new bond investments acquired in 2009 was approximately $500,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P171_S3	Offsetting this increase was a decrease in interest income resulting from the disposal of two bond investments plus the foreclosure of the Prairiebrook bond in 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P172_S0	Gain on sale of asset held for sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P172_S1	In September 2009, the Company sold the Oak Grove Commons apartments, an asset held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for $3.75 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P172_S2	After the deduction of selling expenses, commissions and cash advances made to the property, the Company realized a taxable gain of approximately $863,000 from the sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P173_S0	The Chandler Creek and Deerfield bonds were sold in 2008 for par value plus accrued interest.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P173_S1	The loss resulted from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P174_S0	Other interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P174_S1	Although cash and cash equivalents average outstanding balances were greater during 2009, the decrease in interest income is attributable to significantly lower interest rates earned during 2009 as compared to 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P175_S0	Real estate operating expenses increased approximately $1.2 million during 2009 as compared to 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P175_S1	Approximately $1.5 million of the increase is attributable to the acquisition of three MF Properties, the Commons at Churchland and Glynn Place Apartments acquired in the second half of 2008 and Greens of Pine Glen, acquired in the first quarter of 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P175_S2	In addition, Cross Creek Apartments, a consolidated VIE, acquired during the second quarter of 2009, contributed approximately $410,000 of additional real estate operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P175_S3	Offsetting these increases was a net decrease of approximately $770,000 in VIE real estate operating expenses mainly from decreased repairs, maintenance and supplies expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P176_S0	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates its investments for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P176_S1	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of value to support the investment carrying values.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S0	Investments tested for impairment include all fixed assets, bond investments and taxable loans made to various properties and other amounts due to the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S1	Such evaluation is based on cash flow and discounted cash flow models.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S2	The Company concluded that there was no impairment of fixed assets or bond investments as of December 31, 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S3	This evaluation did determine that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and that an additional allowance or bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S4	An allowance for bad debt and associated provision for loan loss of approximately $700,000 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S5	Additionally, in May 2008, the Company filed a petition of foreclosure on the Prairiebrook Village bonds which were in default.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S6	In 2008, the Company recorded a receivable of approximately $987,000 representing the remaining amounts due from the project owner and developer based on summary judgment obtained.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S7	At December 31, 2009, the current receivable amount was $713,500.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S8	Due to a number of factors the Company recorded an allowance for bad debt against the judgment receivable as of December 31, 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P177_S9	The allowance for bad debt and associated provision for loan loss recorded was $700,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P178_S0	Depreciation and amortization expense, which consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties, and deferred finance cost amortization related to a tender option bond credit facility that was in place until June 2009, increased approximately $1.1 million in 2009 as compared to 2008.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P178_S1	Approximately $1.1 million of the increase is attributable to the acquisition of three MF Properties, the Commons at Churchland and Glynn Place Apartments acquired in the second half of 2008 and Greens of Pine Glen, acquired in the first quarter of 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P178_S2	In addition, Cross Creek Apartments, acquired during the second quarter of 2009, contributed approximately $203,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P178_S3	These increases were offset by a decrease in amortization related to the deferred finance costs from the purchase of the six MF properties in June, 2007 that were fully amortized in 2009 and the tender option bond credit facility.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P179_S0	Interest expense increased approximately $96,000 during 2009 compared to 2008 due to changes in outstanding debt, borrowing rates, and the fair value of our interest rate derivatives.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P179_S1	Total outstanding debt from continuing operations was $87.9 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $85.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and the Company's borrowing cost decreased from 4.5% per annum in 2008 to 3.5% per annum in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P179_S2	These two factors accounted for a decrease in interest expense of approximately $348,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P179_S3	Offsetting this decrease was an increase in interest expense resulting from the mark to market adjustments reflecting decreases in the fair value of our interest rate derivatives.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P180_S0	General and administrative expenses were up approximately $185,000 in 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P180_S1	This increase was realized in professional fees and salary expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P181_S0	In February 2009, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest in Evansville, Indiana, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III in Bloomington, Indiana, and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in Louisville, Kentucky were redeemed.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P181_S1	The properties financed by these redeemed mortgage revenue bonds were required to be consolidated into the Company's financial statements as VIEs under the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P181_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2008, these VIEs met the criteria for discontinued operations under the guidance on property, plant and equipment and they were classified as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P182_S0	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as a sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P182_S1	The transaction was completed for a total purchase price of $32.0 million resulting in a gain on sale for GAAP reporting to the Company of approximately $26.5 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P182_S2	The redemption of the bonds did not result in a taxable gain to the Company.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P187_S1	The decrease in mortgage revenue bond investment income during 2010 compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the redemption of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in February 2009.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P191_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P192_S0	The bond redemptions secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in February 2009 resulted in a loss from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the bonds.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P198_S0	The decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P198_S1	Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was a result of the mark to market adjustment of the Partnership 's derivatives.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P198_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P198_S3	The remaining change in interest expense results from changes in the average outstanding debt throughout the year combined with changes in the Partnership 's cost of borrowing.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P198_S4	The average outstanding debt decreased slightly while the average cost of borrowing increased slightly from approximately 3.5% per annum in 2009 to approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P221_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P221_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P221_S3	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P221_S4	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.

1059142_11_ITEM7_P225_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.7 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P226_S0	Cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P226_S1	Beginning with the distribution for the second quarter of 2009, the Partnership's annual distribution was reduced from $0.54 per unit to $0.50 per unit due to the General Partner's determination that higher borrowing costs and other factors would reduce the cash available to the Partnership to make distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S0	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S1	At December 31, 2010 , the Partnership has outstanding debt financing of $95.6 million secured by 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with a total par value of $125.6 million plus approximately $15.2 million in restricted cash.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , the debt outstanding related to the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio of approximately $189.3 million plus restricted cash results in a leverage ratio of 47%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S3	The outstanding debt financing is the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac, discussed above (see Note 9).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S4	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $10.6 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S5	These mortgage loans mature at various times from November 2011 through November 2013 (see Note 10).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P227_S6	The total debt financing plus mortgage loans of $106.2 million results in a leverage ratio to Total Assets of 44%.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P228_S0	The Partnership's principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to unitholders, interest and principal on debt financing and general and administrative expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P228_S1	The Partnership also uses cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S0	unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S1	Distributions to unitholders depend primarily upon the amount of base and contingent interest received on the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and cash received from other investments, the amount of borrowings and the effective interest rate of these borrowings, and the amount of the Partnership's undistributed cash.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S2	The General Partner believes that cash provided by its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments will be adequate to meet its projected long-term liquidity requirements, including the payment of expenses, interest, and distributions to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S3	Recently, income from investments has not been sufficient to fund such expenditures without utilizing cash reserves to supplement the deficit.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S4	See discussion below regarding Cash Available for Distribution.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S5	As a result, beginning with the second quarter 2009 distribution, the General Partner lowered the Company's regular annual distribution from $0.54 to $0.50 per BUC, or $0.125 per quarter per BUC.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P229_S6	The General Partner believes that distributions at this level are sustainable, however, if actual results vary from current projections and the actual CAD generated is less than the new regular distribution, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P230_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by their real estate investments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P230_S1	Net rental revenues from a multifamily apartment property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P231_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P231_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P231_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P232_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary uses of cash are: (i) the payment of operating expenses; and (ii) the payment of debt service.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S0	On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased approximately $2.5 million compared to the same period a year earlier mainly due to changes in working capital components.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S1	Cash from investing activities decreased approximately $60.4 million in 2010 as compared to 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S2	The largest change in investing activities relates to $32.0 million in cash proceeds realized in the first quarter of 2009 from the early redemption of the bonds on Ashley Pointe, Woodbridge - Louisville and Woodbridge - Bloomington.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S3	No proceeds from the sale or redemption of investments were realized in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S4	Restricted cash increased approximately $18.1 million in 2010 due to the TEBS facility requirements as compared to a decrease in restricted cash in 2009 of approximately $7.9 million resulting in an increase in cash utilized of approximately $26.0 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S5	Net cash utilized for the acquisition of new investments in bonds, property partnerships, and other assets totaled approximately $31.0 million in 2010 compared to approximately $31.8 million in 2009 resulting in a decrease in cash utilized for investments of approximately $800,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S6	An investment sold in 2009 resulted in a $3.5 million increase in 2009 cash which was not repeated in 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S7	Principal payments received resulted in an approximate $300,000 increase year over year.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S8	Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased approximately $43.9 million compared to the same period a year earlier.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S9	Cash provided by debt financings increased approximately $40.3 million in 2010 as compared to 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S10	Net cash provided by the sale of additional BUCs increased $2.7 million in 2010 over 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S11	Principal payments on debt declined approximately $9.4 million in 2010 as compared to 2009.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S12	Cash used for interest rate derivatives and financing costs increased approximately $5.4 million and cash used for distributions increased approximately $3.1 million, accounting for the remaining change in cash from financing activities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P233_S13	The main transactions driving the changes in financing cash flows were the TEBS Financing closing in September and the sale of additional BUCs closing in April.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P234_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P234_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P234_S2	To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, certain income due to the General Partner (defined as Tier 2 income in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative expense or income (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, impairments on bonds, losses related to Consolidated VIEs including the cumulative effect of accounting change, and depreciation and amortization expense are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P235_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P235_S1	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P236_S0	During June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, the Ohio Properties, were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity (see Note 5).
1059142_11_ITEM7_P236_S1	As part of the transaction, the Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P236_S2	The new owners did not contribute any capital to the transaction and the Company has effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S0	Pursuant to guidance related to property, plant, and equipment for real estate sales the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for decrecognition of the properties and full accrual accounting treatment for the resulting gain.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S1	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S2	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S3	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a deferred gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S4	The properties will continue to be presented as MF Properties and no gain will be recognized until such time as the transaction can be accounted for as a sale.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S5	As the deferred gain on the transaction represents cash paid to the Company and no on-going legal obligations related to the Ohio Properties or potential obligation to repay any amounts exists, the deferred gain is CAD and is shown as an adjustment in the CAD Calculation below.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P237_S6	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P238_S0	Beginning with the distribution for the second quarter of 2009, the Partnership's annual distribution was reduced from $0.54 per unit to $0.50 per unit due to AFCA 2's determination that higher borrowing costs and other factors would reduce the cash available to the Partnership to make distributions.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P238_S1	At times recently CAD has not been sufficient to fully fund such distributions without utilizing cash reserves to supplement the deficit.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P238_S2	While the Partnership currently expects to maintain the annual distribution amount of $0.50 per BUC, if it is unable to generate CAD at levels in excess of the annual distribution, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P239_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P240_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P240_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P240_S2	For the year ended 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio partnerships generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier II income.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P240_S3	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove and from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P241_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , the Partnership held tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by multifamily housing projects.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P241_S1	The multifamily housing projects are owned by entities that are not controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P241_S2	The Partnership has no equity interest in these entities and does not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P241_S3	Some of the ownership entities are deemed to be Consolidated VIEs and are consolidated with the Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P241_S4	The VIEs that are consolidated with the Partnership do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P242_S0	The Partnership does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P242_S1	As such, the Partnership is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P243_S0	The Partnership does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Partnership or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P244_S0	The Partnership has the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010:
1059142_11_ITEM7_P245_S0	As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2011 consist of the paydowns on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P245_S1	The Partnership plans to refinance or retire the current maturing mortgage in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P246_S0	With respect to the financial results of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the multifamily residential properties, which collateralize the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P246_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P246_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P246_S3	Inflation did not have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P247_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted ASC 810, Consolidations, which requires an entity to perform an analysis to determine whether the entity's variable interest or interests give it a controlled financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P247_S1	The purpose of the analysis is to identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P248_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P248_S1	The new accounting guidance amends previously issued guidance and adds new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P248_S2	It also provides clarification about existing fair value disclosures, the level of disaggregation required, and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P249_S0	issuances, and settlements on a gross basis which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P250_S0	The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P251_S0	This statement was codified into ASC 860.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P252_S0	On and after the effective date, the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P252_S1	Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose entities, as defined under the previous accounting standards, should be evaluated for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P252_S2	The guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P252_S3	The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P253_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P253_S1	ASU No. 2010-20 enhances the existing disclosure requirements providing more transparency of the allowance for loan losses and credit quality of financing receivables.
1059142_11_ITEM7_P253_S2	The new disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period will be effective for the first interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P253_S3	The new disclosures that relate to activity occurring during the reporting period will be effective for the first interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, or first quarter of fiscal 2011 and thereafter in the Company's case .
1059142_11_ITEM7_P253_S4	The adoption of ASU 2010-20 impacted disclosures but did not affect financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Partnership's primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Partnership's exposure to market risks relates primarily to its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and its debt financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Partnership bases the fair value of the tax-exempt bonds, which have a limited market, on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P1_S1	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , all of the Partnership 's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management's discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P3_S0	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership 's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The nature of the Partnership's investment in the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the debt financing used to finance these investments exposes the Partnership to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear base interest at fixed rates and may additionally pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2010 , the weighted average base rate of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was 6.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Accordingly, the interest income generated by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is generally fixed, except to the extent the underlying properties generate enough excess cash flow to pay contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Partnership has a $95.6 million TEBS financing agreement that provides for interest at a floating rate equal to weekly SIFMA plus 190 basis points.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The effective interest rate for this credit facility as of December 31, 2010 was 2.24% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P5_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2010, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $957,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P6_S0	The interest rate of the mortgage financing on the MF Properties fluctuates based on the LIBOR.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P6_S1	Accordingly, the cost of borrowing on the debt will increase as the LIBOR increases.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P6_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , the outstanding balance of the mortgage financing of the MF Properties was $10.6 million.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P6_S3	The weighted average effective interest rate for 2010 on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010 was approximately 4.6% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P6_S4	If the average LIBOR Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2010 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $172,000.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P8_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Partnership entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In conjunction with the TEBS Financing and the payment of the Bank of America credit facility, the $50.0 million interest rate derivative purchased on June 18, 2009, was terminated.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P10_S0	The $4.5 million interest rate cap with Bank of America relates to the Glynn Place mortgage loan.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P10_S1	During June 2010, a $12.8 million interest rate derivative purchased on July 9, 2009 was allowed to expire as the related mortgage was retired.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership's interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2010:
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P11_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in a decrease of approximately $572,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to an increase of approximately $830,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 .
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P12_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $3.4 million and $141,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The fair value of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which bear fixed base interest rates, is also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P13_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of the bonds to decrease.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P13_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the bonds do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners' capital and book value per unit.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P13_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the bonds decreases, the Partnership may need to provide additional collateral for its debt financing.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P14_S0	The Partnership's primary credit risk is the risk of default on its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans collateralized by the multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P14_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P14_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P14_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P15_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P16_S0	A property's ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P17_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P17_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Additionally, the Partnership may invest in construction bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P18_S1	At December 31, 2010, one bond owned by the Partnership is a construction bond.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The principle risk associated with construction lending is the risk that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P19_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P19_S2	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause the Partnership to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to it on the tax-exempt bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures its tax-exempt bond on the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P20_S0	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P20_S1	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P20_S2	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P20_S3	In order to lower these risks, the Partnership has required the owners/developers of these projects to enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts, obtain payment and performance bonds, and have capitalized interest reserve funds.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , based on an accumulation of individual circumstances, the Partnership has identified three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S1	These bonds are Woodland Park, DeCordova and Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S2	The Partnership has evaluated these bond holdings for an other-than-temporary decline in value and the related taxable loans for potential impairment as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S3	As of December 31, 2010 , Woodland Park owes the Partnership approximately $15.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and $914,000 under taxable loans, DeCordova owes the Partnership approximately $4.9 million under tax-exempt bonds and $648,000 under taxable loans and Weatherford owes the Partnership approximately $4.7 million under tax-exempt bonds and $1.1 million under taxable loans.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S4	Based on the impairment testing, the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of the Woodland and DeCordova bonds existed at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P21_S5	Additionally, the Partnership concluded that no impairment of the taxable loans made to Residences at DeCordova existed, however, an allowance for loan loss of approximately $914,000 was recorded against the taxable loan balance due from Woodland Park.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P22_S0	As of December 31, 2010 the Weatherford tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and taxable loans owned by the Partnership have been written down.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The resulting impairment charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $3.3 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P23_S0	As a result of the failure of the property owner to secure an alternative plan of financing, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P23_S1	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P23_S2	The Partnership has taken over the project and intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the project.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P23_S3	Upon the completion of construction the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P23_S4	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment in Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S0	Defaults on its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S1	In addition, if a property's net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S2	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan secured by the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S3	In the event of a default on a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S4	If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P24_S5	However, such amounts will no longer represent tax-exempt interest to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P25_S0	The Partnership's primary method of managing the credit risks associated with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans is to perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these mortgage bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance of such property on a continuous basis.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P26_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2010 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P26_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks on the Partnership will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating strategies at that time and overall business and economic environment.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S0	The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been temporarily increased to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S2	At various times, the cash balances may exceed the $250,000 limit.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_11_ITEM7A_P27_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company's portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Partners of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, of partners' capital and comprehensive income (loss), and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P5_S0	As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the financial statements include total tax-exempt investments valued at approximately $100,600,000 (42% of total assets) and $69,400,000 (37% of total assets) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P5_S1	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 , management's estimates were based on discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P6_S0	As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted guidance related to the consolidation of Variable Interest Entities effective January 1, 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P7_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 11, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P12_S0	AMERICA FIRST TAX EXEMPT INVESTORS, L.P.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P13_S0	America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P13_S1	Interest on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P13_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050 unless terminated earlier under provisions of its Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company reported in this Form 10-K include the assets and results of operations of the Partnership, the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest, six entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ), and two bonds secured by the three properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ) subject to a sales agreement (see Note 6) which are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P16_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new provisions of the consolidation guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations that amended the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and the definition of a VIE, and requires enhanced disclosures to provide more information about an enterprise's involvement in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P16_S1	Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P17_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P18_S0	The revised accounting standard introduces a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P18_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P18_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership has re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P18_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P18_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P19_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P19_S1	The adoption of these provisions on January 1, 2010 resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities previously included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P19_S2	Through the continual reconsideration criteria, effective March 1, 2010 two additional entities determined to be VIEs were consolidated (see Note 4).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P20_S0	Three of the VIEs related to 2009 are presented in the financial statements as Discontinued Operations (Note 8).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P20_S1	Stand alone financial information of the Partnership reported in this Form 10-K includes only the assets and results of operation of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P20_S2	In the Company's consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P21_S0	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of the VIEs for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to Beneficial Unit Certificate ( BUC ) holders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P22_S0	Pursuant to the guidance on business combinations, the Company allocates the total acquisition cost of a property acquired to the land, building and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P22_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P23_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P23_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P24_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been temporarily increased to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S2	At various times the cash balances may exceed the $250,000 limit.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P25_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company's portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P26_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash, which is legally restricted to use, is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balance with the Bank of America, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P26_S1	At December 31, 2010, the TEBS facility required an additional $15.2 million added as restricted cash balances.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P27_S0	Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Other Tax-Exempt Bonds The Company accounts for its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P27_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P27_S2	All of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P27_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the tax-exempt interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S1	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S2	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S3	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S4	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P28_S5	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P29_S1	The Company evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P30_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P31_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P31_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P32_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P32_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P33_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P34_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P35_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P35_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P36_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P37_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P38_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P38_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P38_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P39_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P39_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P39_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P39_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P40_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P41_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S0	The interest income received by the Company from its investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S1	Base interest income on fully-performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S2	Tax-exempt bonds are considered to be fully-performing if the bond is currently meeting all of its obligations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S3	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S4	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Company if the properties financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds generate excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond agreement, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S6	The Company reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P42_S7	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P43_S0	Interest income on other tax-exempt bonds is recognized as earned.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company owns some tax-exempt bonds which were purchased at a discount.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P44_S1	The discount is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in income in the current period.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company eliminates the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P46_S0	Variable interest entities ( VIEs ) When the Partnership invests in a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is collateralized by a multifamily property, the Partnership will evaluate the entity which owns the property financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond to determine if it is a VIE as defined by the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P47_S0	The guidance on consolidations is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P47_S1	If it is determined that the entity is a VIE, the Partnership will then evaluate if it is the primary beneficiary of such VIE, by determining whether the Partnership will absorb the majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns, or both.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the Partnership determines itself to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the assets, liabilities and financial results of the related multifamily property will be consolidated in the Partnership's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P47_S3	As a result of such consolidation, the tax-exempt or taxable debt financing provided by the Partnership to such consolidated VIE will be eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P48_S0	and principal payments on such debt and these payments will retain their characterization as either tax-exempt or taxable interest for income tax reporting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P49_S0	Since the Partnership has no legal ownership of the VIEs, creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P50_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company's investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P50_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19-40 years on multifamily residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P50_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P51_S0	Management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P51_S1	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P52_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P53_S0	Funding to the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P53_S1	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P54_S0	Based on the termination notice, the Company determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation are impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P54_S1	As of December 31, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down to estimated fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P54_S2	The resulting impairment charge and provision for loan loss of approximately $3.3 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P54_S3	In February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership and has begun construction on the Weatherford property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P54_S4	There were no impairment losses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P55_S0	Property Loans In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of the some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P55_S1	The repayment of these loans is dependent largely on the value of the property which collateralizes the loan.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P55_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralizes the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we evaluate a number of different DCF models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P56_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P57_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P57_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P58_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P58_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recognized loan losses of approximately $562,000, $1.4 million and $0, respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P59_S0	Accounting for TEBS Financing The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS Financing (Note 9) and has determined that the securitization transaction does not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P59_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P59_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P60_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P60_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P60_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P61_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P61_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P62_S0	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P62_S1	As effective control has not been transferred the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P63_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P63_S1	As part of the TEBS Financing certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P63_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P63_S3	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P64_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P65_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P65_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P66_S0	The Partnership also considered the related party relationship of the entities involved in the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P66_S1	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P67_S0	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing on the ATAX TEBS I, LLC balance sheet and all activities associated with the TEBS Financing are presented with the results of the ATAX TEBS I, LLC operations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P68_S0	As noted above, ATAX TEBS I, LLC is a Consolidated Subsidiary of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P69_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement, which approximates the effective interest method.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P69_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the stated maturity of the related tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which approximates the effective interest method.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P69_S2	As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $4.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P69_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of $932,000 and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P70_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P70_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P71_S0	At December 31, 2010 and 2009 , the Company evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $13.9 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively, against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S1	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S2	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S3	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P72_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P73_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (Note 6) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P73_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P75_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P75_S1	The Company's interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P75_S2	The Company is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P75_S3	The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P76_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P77_S0	Net Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P77_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per BUC holder:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Company owns a non-controlling interest in the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P78_S1	Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P78_S2	The adoption of the new guidance required a change in what was formerly minority interest to noncontrolling interest and the placement of noncontrolling interest within the partners' capital section of the consolidated balance sheet rather than in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P78_S3	The guidance required retrospective adoption; in this annual report the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and partners' capital for the year ended December 31, 2008 has been revised to reflect the reclassification of the non-controlling interests.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P79_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P80_S0	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P80_S1	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P81_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P81_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of such date.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P81_S3	For purposes of the Agreement of Limited Partnership, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (Note 6) will be included in the Partnership's Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P82_S0	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P82_S1	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership also allows the General Partner to withhold, from time to time, Interest Income and Residual Proceeds and to place these amounts into a reserve to provide funding for working capital or additional investments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P83_S1	In 2005, the General Partner placed Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest of approximately $10.9 million into the reserve.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P83_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , all amounts of Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest have been distributed.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P84_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs as of the date of the implementation of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P84_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Partnership invests in federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P85_S1	The Partnership owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P85_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P85_S3	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S0	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a variable interest entity ( VIE ).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Partnership has determined that, as of January 1, 2010, six of the entities financed by tax-exempt bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S2	These VIEs are Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S3	The Gardens of DeCordova) and Residences at Weatherford ("Weatherford") (f/k/a The Gardens of Weatherford), and began foreclosure procedures.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S4	The foreclosure on these bonds was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S5	Simultaneous with the foreclosure, the properties were acquired through the assumption of liabilities by new ownership and the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership became the obligations of the new owners.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S6	Prior to the foreclosure and ownership transfer the owners of these properties were not considered VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P86_S7	Based on the foreclosures and the lack of sufficient equity investment at risk by the new owners, these entities were determined to be Consolidated VIEs in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P87_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P87_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities' ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P88_S0	Under the prior consolidation standards the Partnership consolidated Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest as it held the majority of the variable interests in these VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P88_S1	Under the revised standards, the Partnership has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of four of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P88_S2	As a result of adopting the new guidance on January 1, 2010, the Partnership no longer reports Ashley Square and Cross Creek on a consolidated basis.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P89_S0	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P90_S0	The Partnership has determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes, Lake Forest, DeCordova and Weatherford VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P90_S1	The capital structure of each of these VIEs consists of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P90_S2	The senior debt is in the form of a tax-exempt multifamily housing mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the VIEs' total capital.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P90_S3	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P91_S0	The equity ownership in four of these entities, Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lake and Lake Forest, is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by four individuals, three of which are related parties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P91_S1	Additionally, each of these properties, with the exception of Weatherford which is currently under construction, is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, America First Properties Management Company, LLC ( Properties Management ) which is an affiliate of Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P92_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P92_S1	The Partnership also considered the related party relationships of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P92_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P93_S0	As noted above, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P93_S1	The following is a discussion of the circumstances related to the DeCordova and Weatherford properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P94_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Granbury, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P94_S1	Construction was completed in April 2009 and lease-up continues, however, the property has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S0	In January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove the limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S1	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S2	At that time the general partner was allowed to continue in that capacity and a new limited partner was admitted.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S3	The foreclosure was a reconsideration event under the variable interest entity guidance and as a result of the reevaluation, the bond was eliminated and the entity which owns the property was consolidated as a VIE effective March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S4	At the request of the Partnership, in April 2010, the property owners reduced the number of units set aside for affordable tenants to 60% and began leasing 30 units to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S5	The property continued to experience slow lease-up and in December 2010, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S6	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S7	As of December 31, 2009, the property had 31 units leased out of total available units of 76, or 41% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S8	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 65 units leased out of total available units of 76, or approximately 86% physical occupancy and an additional eight leases are pending.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S9	At this time the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P95_S10	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to realize its investment in DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P96_S0	Residences at Weatherford are currently under construction and will contain 76 units upon completion.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P97_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Weatherford, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P97_S1	At this time infrastructure construction activities have been substantially completed but no construction has begun on the actual apartment buildings.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S0	In January 2010, the Partnership issued a Notice of Default through the bond trustee and began foreclosure procedures to remove the limited partner.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S1	Such notice was issued in February 2010 and the foreclosure was completed in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S2	At that time the general partner was allowed to continue in that capacity and a new limited partner was admitted.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S3	The foreclosure was a reconsideration event under the variable interest entity guidance and as a result of the reevaluation, the bond was eliminated and the entity that owns the property was consolidated as a VIE effective in March 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S4	Through this process the Partnership anticipated that the new property owner would recapitalize the property by pursuing an alternative plan of financing.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P98_S5	Specifically, the Partnership worked with the general partner of the owner to identify available Tax Credit Assistance Program ( TCAP ) funding through application to the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs ( TDHCA ).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S0	a TCAP Written Agreement with TDHCA was approved and entered into which committed TCAP funds to the project pending the completion of formal agreements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S1	Formal agreements and funding were originally expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2010, however, the process was delayed due to the large number of transactions involving TDHCA to be closed.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S2	During the delay TDHCA identified certain issues in funding and compliance with other projects in which the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford is involved.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S3	As a result of these issues, in October 2010, TDHCA issued a Notice of Termination of TCAP Funding to the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S4	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S5	Based on the termination notice, the Company has determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S6	As of December 31, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P99_S7	The resulting impairment charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $3.3 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P100_S0	As a result of the failure of the property owner to secure an alternative plan of financing, the Partnership issued a second Notice of Default through the bond trustee to begin foreclosure procedures in order to remove both the general partner and the limited partner and take ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P100_S1	This second foreclosure was completed in February 2011 at which time the ownership of the property was taken by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P100_S2	The Partnership has taken over the project and intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the project.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P100_S3	Upon the completion of construction, the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P100_S4	Once the property is leased up and stabilized the Partnership will evaluate its options in order to realize its investment in Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P101_S0	As a result of adopting the new accounting guidance, we deconsolidated two entities, the Ashley Square and Cross Creek VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P101_S1	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of each VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P101_S2	The significant activities of the VIE that impact the economic performance of the entity include leasing and maintaining apartments, determining if the property is to be sold, decisions relating to debt refinancing, the selection of or replacement of the property manager and the approval of the operating and capital budgets.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P101_S3	As discussed below, while the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P102_S0	Ashley Square - Ashley Square Housing Cooperative acquired the ownership of the Ashley Square apartments in December 2008 from Ashley Square LLC through a warranty deed of transfer and an assumption of debt.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P102_S1	This transfer of ownership constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P103_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P103_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P103_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P104_S0	The VIE is organized as a housing cooperative and the 99% equity owner of this VIE is The Foundation for Affordable Housing ( FAH ), an unaffiliated Nebraska non-profit organization.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P104_S1	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P105_S0	Cross Creek - Cross Creek Apartments Holdings LLC is the owner of the Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P105_S1	On January 1, 2010, Cross Creek Apartment Holdings LLC entered into a new operating agreement and admitted three new members.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P105_S2	These new members committed approximately $2.2 million of capital payable in three installments including $563,000 on January 1, 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P105_S3	The new operating agreement and admission of new owner members constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P106_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital at risk.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P106_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P106_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P107_S0	The three newly admitted members of this VIE are each unaffiliated with the Partnership and have contributed significant equity capital to the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P107_S1	These members collectively control a 99% interest in the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P107_S2	The other 1% member of this VIE is FAH, which is also unaffiliated with the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P107_S3	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P108_S0	The following table presents information regarding the carrying value and classification of the assets held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2010, which constitute a variable interest in Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P109_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the assets, liabilities and results of operation of the Partnership and the six Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P109_S1	Financial information of the Partnership, on a stand-alone basis, includes only the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the impact of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P109_S2	In the Company's consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P110_S0	The following tables provide information about the six Consolidated VIEs in 2010 and the six VIEs consolidated in 2009 in the Partnership's financial statements under the provisions of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P110_S1	These schedules also include information on the tax-exempt bonds owned by the Partnership which are eliminated in consolidation, as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P111_S0	In addition to the tax-exempt bonds detailed below, the Partnership has made taxable loans to VIEs of $18.4 million and $14.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following tables present the effects of the consolidation of the VIEs on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P113_S0	Consolidating Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 :
1059142_11_ITEM8_P114_S0	Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 and 2008 :
1059142_11_ITEM8_P115_S0	In February 2009, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by assets of the VIEs presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2008 were redeemed.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P115_S1	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as the sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P115_S2	The transaction was completed in the first quarter of 2009 for a total purchase price of $32.0 million resulting in a gain on sale for GAAP reporting of approximately $26.5 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P115_S3	The redemption of the bonds did not result in a taxable gain to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P116_S0	On a stand-alone basis, the Partnership received approximately $30.9 million of net proceeds from the bond redemption.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P116_S1	These proceeds represent the repayment of the bond par values plus accrued base interest and approximately $2.3 million of contingent interest.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P116_S2	The contingent interest, recognized in the first quarter of 2009, represents additional earnings to the Partnership beyond the recurring base interest earned on the bond portfolio.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P116_S3	The contingent interest also represents additional Cash Available for Distribution to the unitholders of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.13 per unit.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S0	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S1	However, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S4	Each tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a first mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and an assignment of rents.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P117_S5	Each of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bears tax-exempt interest at a fixed rate and the Clarkson College bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P118_S0	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Company have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P118_S1	The Company had the following investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as of dates shown:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P119_S0	As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P119_S1	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P119_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P120_S0	As of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P121_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S1	At December 31, 2010 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 7.2% to 8.7%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 7.9% to 9.6% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $8.4 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P122_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P123_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on these tax-exempt bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P123_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , all of the current bond investments except the Ashley Square, Brookstone, Cross Creek, Lost Creek, and Southpark investments have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P123_S2	The Company has reviewed each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P123_S3	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on the bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P123_S4	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further, the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, or if the Company's intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P124_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company has identified the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Company's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Company has evaluated this bond holding for an other-than-temporary decline in value as of December 31, 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P124_S2	Based on this evaluation, the Company has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of Woodland Park existed at December 31, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P125_S0	Our ability to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P126_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P126_S2	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principle and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P126_S3	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P126_S4	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions the most significant of which include:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P127_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P128_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P129_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P129_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P130_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P131_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P132_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P132_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P132_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P133_S0	The various revenue and expense projections for the Woodland Park property operations are summarized as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P134_S0	Revenue and expenses for model year one (2011) are equal to the property budget.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P134_S1	Budgeted revenues of approximately $1.7 million are based on a budgeted average occupancy of 88%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P134_S2	Revenues are projected to grow over the ten years in the model to approximately $2.2 million in year ten based on average annual rental increases of 2% and an average occupancy increasing over time to 93%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P134_S3	Expenses are projected to grow to approximately $1.0 million in year ten based on average annual increases of 2.5%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P135_S0	The following is a discussion of the circumstances related to the Woodland Park bond.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S0	Woodland Park was completed in November 2008, but remains in its initial lease-up phase and has not yet reached stabilization which is defined in the bond documents as the generation of a 1.15:1 debt service coverage ratio for six straight months.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S1	Additionally, there were insufficient funds on deposit with the bond trustee to make the debt service payment of approximately $452,000 on the bonds which was due on May 3, 2010 and the property owner did not provide additional capital to fund the shortfall.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S2	As a result, a payment default on the bonds has occurred.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S3	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership has issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and has started the foreclosure process.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S4	The foreclosure process is expected to take several months to complete.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S5	The Partnership would expect to remove and replace the general and limited partners of the property owner through foreclosure.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S6	This action would allow a new property owner to re-syndicate the LIHTCs associated with this property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S7	If these LIHTCs can be successfully re-syndicated, it will provide additional capital to the project which can be used to support debt service payments on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds until property operations improve to the point that sufficient cash is generated to pay any past due amounts on the bonds as well as ongoing debt service.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P136_S8	If the re-syndication of LIHTCs is not successful, the Partnership may pursue other options including making additional taxable loans to the property or completing the foreclosure process and taking direct ownership of the property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Partnership believes that the most significant issue in the slow lease-up of the property and its failure to achieve stabilization has been the 100% set aside of the rental units for tenants that make less than 60% of the area median income.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S1	At the request of the Partnership, in April 2010, the property owner reduced the number of units set aside for affordable tenants to 75% and began leasing 59 units to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S2	Additionally, the property owner has agreed that, if needed to stabilize the property, it would further reduce the units set aside for affordable tenants to 60% thereby making an additional 35 units available to market rate tenants.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S3	As of December 31, 2009, the property had 116 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 49% physical occupancy.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S4	As of December 31, 2010, occupancy has increased to 190 units, or 81% physical occupancy, and an additional three leases are pending.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P137_S5	Based on the level of leasing activity resulting from the change in the mix of affordable and market rate tenants, the Partnership continues to believe that Woodland is capable of reaching stabilization.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P138_S0	In November 2010, the Company acquired the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for a 250 unit multi-family apartment complex in Humble, Texas (Houston) known as Autumn Pines for approximately $12.3 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P138_S1	The bond par value is $13.4 million with an annual interest rate of 5.8%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P138_S2	The bond purchase price results in a yield to maturity of approximately 7.0% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P138_S3	The bond matures in October 2046.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods (I and II) and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ), were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S3	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S4	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 10.0%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S5	Both series of bonds mature in June 2050.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S6	The Company had previously acquired a 99% interest in the Ohio Properties as part of its strategy of acquiring existing multifamily apartment properties that it expects will be partially financed with new tax-exempt mortgage bonds at the time the properties become eligible for the issuance of additional low-income housing tax credits.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S7	In addition to the new tax-exempt bonds acquired by the Company, the plan of financing for the acquisition included other subordinated debt issued by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S8	The new owners ultimately plan to sell limited partnership interests in the properties and syndicate LIHTCs as part of the overall plan of finance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P139_S9	The new owners have not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company has effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S0	Pursuant to the guidance on property, plant, and equipment for real estate sales, the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for derecognition of the properties or full accrual accounting for the gain.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S1	The guidance requires sufficient equity capital as part of a sales transaction to indicate a commitment from the buyer (typically a minimum of 3 to 5% investment by the new owners).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S2	As the buyer has no equity capital in this transaction and the property operations are the current support for the debt service, the Company, in substance, remains the owner for accounting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S3	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S4	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S5	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P140_S6	The properties will continue to be presented as MF Properties and no gain will be recognized until such time as the transaction meets the criteria for derecognition of the properties and gain recognition can be accounted for as a sale (Note 6).

1059142_11_ITEM8_P144_S2	Based on the purchase price discount, the bond will yield approximately 6.8% to the Company.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P147_S1	The general partners of these partnerships are unaffiliated parties and their 1% ownership interest in these limited partnerships is reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as non-controlling interests.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P147_S2	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P150_S3	The Company has allocated $6.8 million of the purchase price to real estate assets.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P150_S4	The purchase price was funded through an assumed mortgage loan of $6.5 million and cash on hand.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P150_S5	The unpaid balance of the note bears a 7% annual interest rate payable monthly.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P150_S6	The Company retired this debt in 2010.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P153_S0	The table below shows the pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Churchland and Glynn Place properties had been acquired at the beginning of the period presented:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P154_S0	The pro forma financial information represents the historical operating results of the combined Company with adjustments for purchase accounting and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period presented.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P155_S0	In addition to the MF Properties, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs in accordance with the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P155_S1	Although the assets of the VIEs are consolidated, the Company has no ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs other than to the extent they serve as collateral for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P155_S2	The results of operations of those properties are recorded by the Company in consolidation but any net income or loss from these properties does not accrue to the unitholders or the general partner, but is instead included in "Unallocated deficit of variable interest entities.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P158_S1	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable loans for impairment.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P158_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable loan values.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P159_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P159_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P160_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 5 above except that the specific discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was 6.5%.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily property could obtain current tax-exempt financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P160_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P160_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principle balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P164_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2008, these VIEs met the criteria for discontinued operations under the guidance on property, plant, and equipment and they were classified as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P165_S0	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as a sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.

1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S0	The Company reports the mortgage loans secured by certain MF Properties on its consolidated financial statements as Mortgages payable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S1	As of December 31, 2010, outstanding mortgage loans totaled approximately $10.6 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S2	As of December 31, 2009, outstanding mortgage loans totaled approximately $30.1 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S3	In June 2010, prior to the sale of the Ohio Properties as discussed in Note 5, the Company repurchased the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage secured by the Ohio Properties at a discount.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S4	The early extinguishment of the mortgage debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P179_S5	In September 2010, the Company repaid the $6.5 million outstanding mortgage secured by Greens of Pine Glen which had a 7% annual interest rate payable monthly and a maturity date of September 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P180_S0	The following is a summary of the Mortgage Loans payable on MF Properties:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P181_S0	The Company's mortgages payable as of December 31, 2010 contractually mature over the next five years and thereafter as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P182_S0	The Partnership expects each of the MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P182_S1	The proceeds from such sale will be utilized to retire any associated outstanding mortgage loan.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P182_S2	Should a mortgage loan reach maturity prior to a sale of the associated MF Property the Partnership would either seek to refinance such mortgage loan or utilize cash reserves to retire the loan.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P182_S3	The Partnership expects to provide tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as part of an overall plan of financing the acquisition of a MF Property by a new property owner.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S0	Issuances of Additional Beneficial Unit Certificates Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S1	Through December 31, 2010, the Partnership had issued a total of 20,285,000 additional BUCs raising net proceeds of approximately $108.2 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $7.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S2	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S3	The most recent issuance was completed in April 2010.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S4	The Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P183_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P184_S0	A substantial portion of the Partnership's general and administrative expenses and certain costs capitalized by the Partnership are paid by AFCA 2 or an affiliate and are reimbursed by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P185_S0	with the acquisition or reissuance of certain tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, debt financing transactions and other capital transactions.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P185_S1	The amounts in the following table represent cash payments to reimburse AFCA 2 or an affiliate for such expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S0	AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or other tax-exempt investments for which the owner of the financed property or other third party is not obligated to pay such administrative fee directly to AFCA 2.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 , the Partnership paid administrative fees to AFCA 2 of approximately $636,000, $304,000, and $314,000, respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S2	In addition to the administrative fees paid directly by the Partnership, AFCA 2 receives administrative fees directly from the owners of properties financed by certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $209,000, $254,000, and $319,000, in 2010 , 2009 , and 2008 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S4	Additionally, in connection with the sale of the Ohio Properties and purchase of the new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of the transaction (see Note 6), the Ohio Properties paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA 2 totaling approximately $231,000.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S5	Although these third party administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S6	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P186_S7	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P187_S0	AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P187_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P187_S2	Mortgage placement fees earned by AFCA 2 totaled approximately $461,000, $282,000 and $61,000, in 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P188_S0	An affiliate of AFCA 2, America First Property Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ) was retained to provide property management services for Ashley Pointe (sold in February 2009), Iona Lakes, Bent Tree, Lake Forest, Fairmont Oaks, DeCordova, Eagle Ridge, Crescent Village, Meadowview, Willow Bend, Post Woods I, Post Woods II, Churchland, Glynn Place, Greens at Pine Glen, Ashley Square, Clarkson College, Cross Creek, and Woodland Park.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P188_S1	The management fees paid to Properties Management amounted to approximately $982,000 in 2010 , $955,000 in 2009 , and $645,000 in 2008 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P188_S2	For the Consolidated VIEs, these management fees are not Partnership expenses but are recorded by each applicable VIE entity and, accordingly, have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P188_S3	Such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by the properties owned by the Consolidated VIEs prior to the payment of any interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership on these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P188_S4	For the MF Properties, these management fees are considered real estate operating expenses.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P189_S0	The owners of four limited-purpose corporations which own apartment properties financed with tax-exempt bonds and taxable loans held by the Company are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Company and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P190_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company has four derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing and mortgages payable.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P190_S1	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P191_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P191_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P192_S0	In conjunction with the TEBS Financing and the payment of the Bank of America credit facility, the $50.0 million interest rate derivative purchased on June 18, 2009, was terminated.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P193_S0	The $4.5 million interest rate cap agreement with Bank of America relates to the Glynn Place mortgage loan.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P193_S1	During June 2010, a $12.8 million interest rate derivative purchased on July 9, 2009 was allowed to expire as the related mortgage was retired as discussed in Note 10.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P193_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P193_S3	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in a decrease of approximately $572,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to an increase of approximately $830,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P194_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P194_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $3.4 million and $141,000 as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P195_S0	Existing fair value guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P195_S1	The guidance on fair value measurements:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P196_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P197_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P198_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P198_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P199_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P200_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P201_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P202_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P203_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P204_S0	Investments in Tax-exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P204_S1	The fair values of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P204_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P205_S0	Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P205_S1	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P205_S2	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P205_S3	Given these facts, the fair value measurement of the Company's investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P206_S0	The effect of the Company's interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Company's variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P206_S1	The effect of the Company's interest rate swap is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P206_S2	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P206_S3	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P207_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_11_ITEM8_P208_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P209_S0	In 2009 the approximate $4.7 million Weatherford bond was reported at an estimated $3.2 million fair market value and included in the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P209_S1	During 2010 this property became a VIE (see Note 4) and its bond was determined to be impaired (Note 5).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P209_S2	The company wrote this bond down to its approximate estimated $2.6 million market value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P209_S3	Weatherford's bond is fully eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P210_S0	Below represents the fair market value of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P211_S0	The Company may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P211_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P212_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P213_S0	Certain of the MF properties own apartment properties that generated LIHTCs under section 42 of the Code for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P213_S1	In connection with the acquisition of partnership interests in these partnerships by subsidiaries of the Company, the Company has agreed to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to recapture of these tax credits to the extent the recapture liability is due to the operation of the properties in a manner inconsistent with the laws and regulations relating to such tax credits after the date of acquisition.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P213_S2	No amount has been accrued for this continent liability because management believes that the likelihood of any payments being required thereunder is remote.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P214_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership acquired the Briarwood Manor Apartments tax-exempt private activity mortgage revenue bond for approximately $4.5 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P214_S1	The bond's approximate outstanding par value is $5.5 million and earns interest at an annual rate of 5.3% with a monthly interest and principal payment and stated maturity date of June 1, 2038.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P214_S2	Based on the purchase price discount, the bond will yield approximately 7.0% per annum to the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P214_S3	The bond was issued for the construction of the Briarwood Manor Apartments, a 100 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Montclair, California, in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P214_S4	The bond does not contain participation interests.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S0	As discussed in Note 4, effective in February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership of DeCordova and Weatherford.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S1	The Company has taken ownership of these properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S2	Prior to foreclosure, the Company did not have any ownership interest in the properties, however, these properties were consolidated VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S3	Subsequent to the foreclosure, the properties will be reported as MF properties and the Company will have an ownership interest in the properties and as a result, Partners' Capital will be impacted by the operating results of the properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S4	The Company has taken over these projects and intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the Weatherford property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S5	Upon the completion of construction, the Company expects to operate the property as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S6	The Company also intends to operate DeCordova as a market rate apartment property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P215_S7	Once each property is leased up and stabilized the Company will evaluate its options in order to realize its investments in Weatherford and DeCordova.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P216_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted ASC 810, Consolidations, which requires an entity to perform an analysis to determine whether the entity's variable interest or interests give it a controlled financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P216_S1	The purpose of the analysis is to identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P217_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P217_S1	The new accounting guidance amends previously issued guidance and adds new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of Levels 1 and 2 and separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements related to Level 3 measurements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P217_S2	It also provides clarification about existing fair value disclosures, the level of disaggregation required, and the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P218_S0	The ASU is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P219_S0	The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P220_S0	This statement was codified into ASC 860.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P221_S0	On and after the effective date, the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity is no longer relevant for accounting purposes.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P221_S1	Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose entities, as defined under the previous accounting standards, should be evaluated for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P221_S2	The guidance must be applied as of the beginning of each reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P221_S3	The adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2010 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P222_S0	In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-20, Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P222_S1	ASU No. 2010-20 enhances the existing disclosure requirements providing more transparency of the allowance for loan losses and credit quality of financing receivables.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P222_S2	The new disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period will be effective for the first interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after December 15, 2010 .
1059142_11_ITEM8_P222_S3	The new disclosures that relate to activity occurring during the reporting period will be effective for the first interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010, or first quarter of fiscal 2011 and thereafter in the Company's case.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P222_S4	The adoption of ASU 2010-20 impacted the disclosures but did not affect financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P223_S0	The Company consists of three reportable segments, Tax-Exempt Bond Investments, MF Properties, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P223_S1	In addition to the three reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidating and eliminating entries because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P224_S0	The Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment consists of the Company's portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P224_S1	Such tax exempt bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P224_S2	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company held fifteen tax-exempt bonds not associated with Consolidated VIEs and six tax-exempt bonds associated with Consolidated VIEs which are bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P224_S3	Additionally, two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties subject to a sales agreement (Note 6) are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P224_S4	The multifamily apartment properties financed by the 21 tax-exempt bonds contain a total of 3,658 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P225_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily apartment properties which are not currently financed by tax-exempt bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P225_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P225_S2	The Partnership's interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P226_S0	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties are subject to a sales agreement (see Notes 5 and 6).
1059142_11_ITEM8_P227_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in a MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P227_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership's CAD.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P228_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company held an interest in five MF Properties containing a total of 602 rental units and three MF Properties subject to a sales agreement containing a total of 362 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P229_S0	Consolidated VIE segment The Consolidated VIE segment consists of multifamily apartment properties which are financed with tax-exempt bonds held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P229_S1	The tax-exempt bonds on these Consolidated VIE properties are eliminated from the Company's financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds are held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P230_S0	The Company does not actually own an equity position in the Consolidated VIEs or their underlying properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P230_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company consolidated six VIE multifamily apartment properties containing a total of 1,152 rental units.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P231_S0	Management closely monitors and evaluates the financial reporting associated with and the operations of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties and performs such evaluation separately from the other operations of the Partnership through interaction with the affiliated property management company which manages the multifamily apartment properties held by the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P232_S0	Management's goals with respect to the properties constituting the Company's Consolidated VIE and MF Properties reportable segments is to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to (i) make all payments of base interest, and possibly pay contingent interest, on the properties included in the Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment and the Consolidated VIE segment, and (ii) distribute net rental income to the Partnership from the MF Properties segment until such properties can be refinanced with additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds meeting the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_11_ITEM8_P232_S1	In order to achieve these goals, management of these multifamily apartment properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of its properties in their respective market areas.

1059142_11_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_11_ITEM9A_P8_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1059142_11_ITEM15_P56_S0	I, Michael J. Draper, Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of the General Partner of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P., certify, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, that:
1059142_11_ITEM15_P57_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership.
1059142_11_ITEM15_P58_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and will be retained by America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P0_S0	America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P0_S1	Interest paid on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P0_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owned 20 federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $188.6 million as of December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 20 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 3,959 rental units located in the states of Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S3	Each bond is secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S4	Each of the bonds provides for "base" interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S5	Additionally, five of the bonds also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P1_S6	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac and three are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank ("DB") in two Tender Option Bond ("TOB") facilities (see Notes 2, 9 and 10).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P2_S1	Three of the entities that own the apartment properties financed by three of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were deemed to be Consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") of the Partnership at December 31, 2011 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P2_S2	Two bonds are secured by three properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ) which are subject to a sales agreement (see Note 3) and are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the properties collateralizing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P5_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P5_S3	Because the return to the Partnership from its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the multifamily residential properties which collateralize these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other multifamily rental properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P6_S0	The Partnership may also invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P6_S1	These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P6_S2	To date, the Partnership has not made any investments of this type.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P7_S1	The Partnership does this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in the best long-term interest of the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership generally does not seek to acquire direct interests in real property as long term or permanent investments.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S1	The Partnership may, however, acquire real estate securing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S3	The Partnership currently holds interests in twelve MF Properties containing 1,772 rental units, of which three are located in Ohio and are currently subject to a sales agreement, one is located in Nebraska, two are located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Virginia, one is located in Georgia, one is located in North Carolina and two are located in Texas.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S4	The Partnership expects the MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S5	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S6	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the Partnership's initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P8_S7	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P9_S0	Current credit markets and general economic conditions have resulted in very few 4% LIHTC syndication and tax-exempt bond financing transactions being completed in recent years.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P9_S1	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities when the market for LIHTC syndications strengthens.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P10_S0	Ten of the 20 properties which collateralize the bonds owned by the Partnership are managed by America First Properties Management Company ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of AFCA 2, which provides property management services for Ashley Square, Iona Lakes Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments, Lake Forest Apartments, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Cross Creek, Woodland Park, and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P10_S1	Weatherford is currently under construction and not subject to a management agreement.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P10_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P10_S3	The properties not currently managed by Properties Management are Autumn Pines, Bella Vista Apartments, Bridle Ridge, Brookstone Apartments, GMF-Madison Apartments, GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments, Runnymede Apartments, South Park Ranch Apartments, Villages at Lost Creek and Woodlynn Village.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P11_S0	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital and (ii) provide regular and increasing cash distributions to our unitholders which are substantially exempt from federal income tax.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P11_S1	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by first mortgages on, multifamily apartment properties, including student housing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P11_S2	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed apartment properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P12_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to our unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P12_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and related investments, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the tax-exempt securities market and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P12_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P13_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P13_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P14_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by multifamily properties that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P14_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required which, if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle the Partnership to receive payment of contingent interest on its bond investment.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P14_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P14_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other tax-exempt investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P14_S4	We may also be able to use a higher-quality investment portfolio to obtain higher leverage to be used to acquire additional investments.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P15_S0	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, but may also consider bonds issued to finance student housing projects and housing for senior citizens.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P15_S1	The four basic types of multifamily housing revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM1_P16_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P16_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable apartment project financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P16_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the apartment project may be rented at market rates.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P17_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the apartment project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P17_S1	Multifamily housing bonds that were issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P18_S0	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed apartment project.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P18_S1	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P18_S2	We expect to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P18_S3	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P19_S0	The Partnership invests in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on multifamily apartment projects.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P19_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P19_S2	Five of the 20 bonds currently owned by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying apartment properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P19_S3	As a result, the amount of interest earned by the Partnership from its investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P20_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Partnership may invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P21_S1	These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P22_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are held by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S0	While the Partnership generally does not seek to acquire equity interests in real property as long-term or permanent investments, it may acquire real estate securing its revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S1	In addition, as part of its growth strategy, the Partnership may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to position itself for a future investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such apartment complexes by a new owner.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new tax-exempt bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S3	The Partnership may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S4	After the LIHTC compliance period, the Partnership would expect to sell its interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek tax-exempt bond financing on the MF Property which the Partnership could acquire.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S5	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the acquisition by the Partnership of an interest in an MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P23_S6	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P24_S0	There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily housing in the United States.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P24_S1	The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) reports that there are approximately 7.1 million American households in need of quality affordable housing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P24_S2	The types of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P24_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the income paid on these bonds is exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P25_S0	The National Council of State Housing Agencies Fact Sheet and HUD have captured some key scale metrics and opportunities of this market:
1059142_12_ITEM1_P26_S0	The availability of tax-exempt bond financing for affordable multifamily housing to be owned by private, for-profit developers in each state in each calendar year is limited by the statewide volume cap distributed as described in Section 146 of the Internal Revenue Code; this private activity bond financing is based on state population and indexed to inflation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P27_S0	The supply of rental units is expected to fall short of demand with apartment vacancies continuing to decline.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P28_S0	In addition to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P28_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with tax-exempt bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P28_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Partnership does not invest in LIHTCs, but is attracted to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and; therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P29_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P29_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P29_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P30_S0	The 2008 Housing Act simplified and expanded the use of LIHTCs and tax-exempt bond financing for low-income multifamily housing industry.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P30_S1	Additionally, it exempted newly issued tax-exempt private activity bonds from Alternative Minimum Tax.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P30_S2	Previously, these tax-exempt private activity bonds were Alternative Minimum Tax preference items for individual taxpayers.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P30_S3	We believe these changes should enhance the Partnership's opportunities for making investments in accordance with its investment criteria.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P31_S0	Current credit market conditions have shown some improvement over the last year which has offered more opportunities for tax- exempt bond financing and a commensurate improvement in LIHTC syndication which often accompanies these transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P31_S1	The Partnership is currently seeing opportunity in new origination as well as secondary market transactions for tax-exempt multifamily housing investment given these improved market conditions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P32_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting restrictions on the availability of debt financing that had prevailed since 2008 began to subside in 2010 and continued to improve in 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM1_P32_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has improved, overall availability remains limited.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P32_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P33_S0	Many participants in the multifamily housing debt sector either reduced their participation in the market or were forced to liquidate some or all of their existing portfolio investments in order to meet their liquidity needs.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P33_S1	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P33_S3	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P34_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P34_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt, together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company, can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P34_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional tax-exempt housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S4	In addition, the economic conditions including higher levels of unemployment, lack of job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S5	While some properties have been negatively effected, our overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 85% during 2011 as compared to 81% during 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S6	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has increased to approximately 83% during 2011 from 80% during 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM1_P35_S7	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability in 2012 and 2013 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will continue to be positive.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P36_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S0	At December 31, 2011 , the Partnership has outstanding debt financing of $112.7 million secured by 15 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an approximate par value of $153.6 million, two taxable bonds with an approximate par value of $700,000 plus approximately $8.0 million in restricted cash.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S1	Our operating policy is to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the debt outstanding as a percentage of the total par value of the Partnerships' total tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable bond portfolio plus the restricted cash of approximately $197.3 million results in a leverage ratio of approximately 57%.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S3	The outstanding debt financing facilities consist of two TOB trusts with Deutsche Bank and a TEBS facility with Freddie Mac (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S4	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $46.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S5	These mortgage loans mature at various times from May 2012 through July 2015 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P37_S6	The total debt financing plus mortgage loans of $158.9 million results in a leverage ratio to Total Assets of 53%.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S1	Through December 31, 2011, the Partnership had issued a total of 20,285,000 additional BUCs raising net proceeds of approximately $108.2 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $7.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S2	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S3	The most recent issuance, included above, was completed in April 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S4	The Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P38_S6	There was no equity raise completed in 2011 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P39_S0	In October 2011, the Briarwood Manor bond was called and retired at Par plus accrued interest for approximately $4.9 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P39_S1	This transaction resulted in approximately $445,000 gain reported in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P39_S2	The net redemption proceeds were used by the Company to retire its $4.0 million term debt with Omaha State Bank.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P39_S3	The Briarwood bond was originally purchased in February 2011 for $4.5 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P40_S0	In May 2011, the outstanding Clarkson College tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond held by the Company was retired early for an amount equal to the outstanding principal and base interest plus accrued but unpaid contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P40_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the Company carried the investment in the Clarkson College bond at an estimated fair market value of approximately $5.1 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P40_S2	The retirement of the bond resulted in a payment to the Partnership of approximately $6.1 million consisting of approximately $5.8 million in principal, approximately $16,000 of base interest and approximately $308,000 of accrued contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S0	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired at par a $3.8 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a $315,000 taxable revenue bond secured by the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments, a 147 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S1	These bonds were issued for the acquisition of the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments by an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.75% and matures on December 1, 2046.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S3	The taxable bond carries an annual interest rate of 7.75% and matures on December 1, 2019.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S4	The bonds do not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S5	The Company has determined that the entity which owns GMF-Madison Tower Apartments is an unrelated not -for-profit which under the accounting guidance is not subject to applying the VIE consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P41_S6	As a result, its financial statements are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S0	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired at par a $11.8 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a $485,000 taxable revenue bond secured by the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments, a 448 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S1	These bonds were issued for the acquisition of the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments by an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.75% and matures on December 1, 2046.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S3	The taxable bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.5% and matures on December 1, 2015.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S4	The bonds do not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S5	The Company has determined that the entity which owns GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments is an unrelated not-for-profit which under the accounting guidance is not subject to applying the VIE consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P42_S6	As a result, its financial statements are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P43_S0	In March 2011, the Partnership purchased The Arboretum on Farnam Drive ("Arboretum"), a 145 unit independent senior living facility located in Omaha, Nebraska, for approximately $20.0 million plus transaction expenses of approximately $449,000.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P43_S1	The purchase price was funded through a conventional mortgage of $17.5 million and cash on hand.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P43_S2	The mortgage payable is with Omaha State Bank, carries a 5.25% fixed rate and matures on March 31, 2014.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P43_S3	The Partnership intends to restructure the property operations by shifting from an entrance fee rental income model utilized by the prior ownership to a current market rent model.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P43_S4	Upon lease-up and stabilization of the property, projected to occur in fiscal 2012, the Partnership expects to sell the property to a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity and acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford properties and one of the Partnership's subsidiaries took 100% ownership interest in these limited liability companies.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S1	Both properties are reported as MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S2	In July 2011, the Company obtained a $6.5 million construction loan secured by the DeCordova and Weatherford properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S3	This construction loan is being used to fund the completion of Weatherford and the expansion of DeCordova.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S4	The construction loan is with an unrelated third party and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9%, maturing on July 28, 2015.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S5	The balance of this note at December 31, 2011 is $4.7 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P44_S6	This agreement requires $500,000 to be held by the Company as restricted cash (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM1_P45_S0	In February, 2012, the Partnership obtained a $2.0 million construction loan secured by the DeCordova property to be used to expand the DeCordova campus by constructing a new apartment building adjacent to the existing DeCordova property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P45_S1	This construction loan is with an unrelated third party and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 5.0%, maturing on February 1, 2017.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S0	In the third quarter of 2010, the Company purchased a minority interest equal to 8.7% ownership in 810 Schutte Road LLC ("Eagle Village"), a 511 bed student housing facility located in Evansville, Indiana.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S1	The minority interest investment totaled approximately $1.1 million and was presented in other assets.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S2	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired the remaining ownership interest in Eagle Village.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S3	Approximately $3.1 million of cash on hand plus a conventional mortgage of approximately $8.9 million was used to purchase the remaining ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S4	The mortgage loan carries a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% but will not be less than 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S5	At December 31, 2011 the interest rate on the loan was 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S6	This mortgage matures on June 1, 2013.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S7	Eagle Village returned $125,000 to the Company as a preferred return on their investment .
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S8	The transaction is eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S9	Eagle Village is wholly owned by a subsidiary of the Partnership and was reported as an MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S10	The Partnership plans to operate the property as a student housing facility.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S11	Once stabilized as a student housing property, the Company will seek to restructure the ownership and capital structure through the sale of the property to a student housing not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P46_S12	The Company anticipates it will purchase tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of such a restructuring.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P47_S0	The Partnership is managed by its general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 ) which is an affiliate of The Burlington Capital Group LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_12_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Partnership has no employees, executive officers or directors.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P47_S2	Certain services are provided to the Partnership by employees of Burlington, which is the general partner of AFCA 2, and the Partnership reimburses Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P47_S3	The Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Partnership competes with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership for the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P48_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S0	Because the Partnership holds tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured entirely by multifamily residential properties and holds an interest in the MF Properties, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other residential real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S2	Multifamily properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S3	To compete effectively, the apartment properties financed or owned by the Partnership must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Partnership's apartment properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P49_S5	These apartment properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P50_S0	The Partnership believes that each of the MF Properties and the properties collateralizing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Partnership is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, it makes no provision for income taxes.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P51_S1	The distributive share of the Partnership's income, deductions and credits is included in each unitholder's income tax return.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P52_S0	The Partnershipholds its interests in MF Properties through various subsidiaries which are C corporations for income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P52_S1	These subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P52_S2	Therefore, the Partnership is only subject to income taxes on these investments to the extent it receives dividends from the subsidiaries.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P53_S0	The VIEs which are reported on a consolidated basis with the Partnership for GAAP reporting purposes as described below under Effect of Implementation of Guidance Changes on Consolidations on Financial Reporting are separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships and limited liability companies.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P53_S1	The Partnership does not presently believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP will impact the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to unitholders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P54_S0	All financial information in this Form 10-K presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, is that of the Partnership and the VIEs on a consolidated basis.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P54_S1	We refer to the Partnership, its wholly owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ), and the consolidated VIEs throughout this Form 10-K as the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P54_S2	We refer to the Partnership and Holding Company, without consolidation of the VIEs, as the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P55_S0	We are a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P55_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P56_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage securities and multifamily real estate properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P57_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S0	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S2	In connection with the operation of the Partnership, our general partner is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments and taxable mortgage loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S3	Ten of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership provide for the payment of this administrative fee to the general partner by the owner of the financed property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S4	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S5	Our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P58_S6	In addition, our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the general partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P59_S0	Our general partner or its affiliates may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P59_S1	Any mortgage placement fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P59_S2	The amount of mortgage placement fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between the general partner or its affiliates and such property owners.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P60_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of apartment complexes.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P60_S1	Properties Management currently manages the twelve MF Properties and ten of the properties whose tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are held by the Partnership and earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P60_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of apartment complexes financed by additional mortgage bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P60_S3	If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P62_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P63_S0	The Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_12_ITEM1_P63_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Partnership are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Cash distributions from the Partnership may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Partnership currently distributes cash to unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P2_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.35 per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Although the Partnership may supplement its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless the Partnership is able to increase its cash receipts through completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to maintain its current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if the Partnership completes its current investment plans.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying multifamily properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying apartment complex and is secured by a first mortgage lien on the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, except in limited cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other apartment complexes, mortgage rates for single-family housing and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our bonds are located, there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The principal of most of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Similarly, if a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying multifamily property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will suffer a loss.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In the event a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The taxable mortgage loans that we make to owners of the apartment properties that secure tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable loans than on the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these taxable loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, the Partnership does not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable mortgage loan if the property is not in default on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future tax-exempt bond financings of these projects.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We expect to ultimately sell these MF Properties to unaffiliated parties often as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our plan is to provide tax-exempt mortgage financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For this and other reasons, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to sell its interests in the MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the value of the Partnership's interest in MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, there is no assurance the Partnership will not incur a loss upon the sale of its interest in an MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P17_S5	During the time the Partnership owns an interest in an MF Property, any net income it receives from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any future issuances of additional units could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Partnership may issue additional units from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing units and a decrease in the market price of the units.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with a specific interest rate indices.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P21_S2	All of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders and may affect the market value of our units.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P23_S0	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A decrease in the value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P23_S2	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the issuance of additional units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, to mitigate the risks we are exposed to as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S1	However, there is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and there is no assurance these costs will not ultimately turn out to exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There is also a risk that a counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This can result in significant period to period volatility in the Partnership's reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require that we deposit tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable rate.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As the holder of the residual interest, the Partnership is entitled to any remaining tax-exempt interest received by the trust after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents and liquidity providers.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Specific risks generally associated with these bond securitization programs include the following:
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of a bond securitization financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P31_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on a specified index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P31_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P31_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying tax-exempt bond interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less tax-exempt bond interest available to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P31_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the Partnership's return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P32_S0	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and no party guarantees the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The residual interests in a trust or other special purpose entity used for these types of financing are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P33_S1	As a result, none of the tax-exempt bond interest received by such a trust will be paid to the Partnership as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P33_S2	The holder of a residual certificate in such a trust can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P33_S3	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Termination of a bond securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause the Partnership to lose the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral it pledged for such financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S0	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for a bond securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the bonds or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Problems with the bonds that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S2	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying bonds, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S3	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S4	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then the Partnership will be required, through its guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P35_S5	As a result, the Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose its investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P36_S0	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair the Partnership's ability to recover the tax-exempt bonds and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In the event the sponsor of a bond securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P37_S1	In that situation, it is possible that the Partnership would not be able to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds it pledged in connection with the bond securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by the Partnership in such trust or other entity.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Significantly tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth were experienced in 2011 and continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, restricted availability of credit, declining residential and commercial real estate markets, volatile energy prices, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to the economic downturn and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P39_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P40_S1	As a result, our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P40_S2	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P41_S0	Our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The majority of our assets consist of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S2	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S5	As a result, our ability to sell our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P42_S6	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P44_S0	All of the apartment properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P44_S2	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P44_S3	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P44_S4	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner's ability to service its debt.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The properties financed by certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P46_S0	Five of the multifamily housing properties financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are located in areas that are prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P46_S1	The current insurable value of these five properties is approximately $78.3 million.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property's value.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the five properties financed by the Partnership that are located in areas rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a 5% deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P47_S2	As a result, if any of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property and this could result in a default on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P47_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P47_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P49_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P50_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P51_S0	If we acquire ownership of apartment properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We may acquire ownership of apartment complexes financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these apartment properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P52_S2	In either case, during the time we own an apartment complex, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P52_S3	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates and increases in operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P52_S4	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership's financial results and ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P53_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of multifamily apartment properties that may affect the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We may invest in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P55_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P55_S2	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P55_S3	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the tax-exempt bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable loan.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S3	Any return on this additional investment would not be tax-exempt.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive tax-exempt interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P56_S5	The overall return to the Partnership from its investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P57_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P58_S0	We may acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P58_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P58_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P58_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P58_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We have assumed certain potential liability relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The Partnership has acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P60_S1	When the Partnership acquires an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after the Partnership acquired its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The Partnership is not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The Partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because it operates under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P62_S1	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The Partnership engages in transactions with related parties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as the General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for many of the multifamily apartment properties that underlie our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own four of the apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Partnership and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S5	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm's length.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P64_S6	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is determined to be taxable.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P66_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P66_S3	If the IRS were to determine that tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We have obtained legal opinions to the effect that the base interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes provided the interest is not paid to a substantial user or related person as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P67_S1	However, these legal opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurances can be given that the conclusions reached will not be contested by the IRS or, if contested, will be sustained by a court.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P67_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt status of the interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is subject to compliance by the underlying properties, and the owners thereof, with the bond documents and covenants required by the bond-issuing authority and the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Among these requirements are tenant income restrictions, regulatory agreement compliance, reporting requirements, use of proceeds restrictions and compliance with rules pertaining to interest arbitrage.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Each issuer of the revenue bonds, as well as each of the underlying property owners/borrowers, has agreed to comply with procedures and guidelines designed to ensure satisfaction with the continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Failure to comply with these continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may cause the interest on our bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P68_S2	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through bond securitization programs in which we place tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds into trusts and are entitled to a share of the tax-exempt interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interests on senior securities issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Not all of the income received by the Partnership is exempt from taxation.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable mortgage loans to the owners of properties which are secured by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The interest income earned by the Partnership on these mortgage loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P70_S2	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclose of a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or a taxable loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P70_S3	In that case, the taxable income received by the Partnership will be allocated to our unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If the Partnership was determined to be an association taxable as corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for the Partnership and its unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Partnership has made an election to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P72_S1	The purpose of this election is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for the Partnership and allow us to pass through our tax-exempt interest to our unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P72_S2	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P72_S3	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders being treated as taxable ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Partnership's earnings and profits, which would include tax-exempt income.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P72_S4	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The listing of the Partnership's units for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market causes the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends and certain other items.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S2	Substantially all of the Partnership's gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on mortgage bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S4	In such a case, if more than 10% of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, the Partnership will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P74_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P75_S0	To the extent the Partnership generates taxable income; unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P76_S0	As a partnership, our unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by the Partnership, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P77_S0	There are limits on the ability of our unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_12_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The ability of unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by the Partnership will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is collateralized by a multifamily housing property.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the first mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P1_S0	As a result of the guidance on consolidations, the Company is required to consolidate certain of the multifamily residential properties securing its bonds because the owners of those properties are treated as Consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company consolidated three multifamily housing properties owned by VIEs located in Florida and South Carolina.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P1_S2	The Partnership does not hold title to the properties owned by the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition to the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs, the Company reports the financial results of the MF Properties on a consolidated basis due to the limited partnership interests held by its subsidiary in the partnerships that own the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P2_S1	The Company consolidated twelve MF Properties located in Nebraska, Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, Georgia, and North Carolina, Texas, and Ohio as of December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM2_P2_S2	Three of these properties ("Ohio Properties") are subject to a sales agreement that does not meet the criteria for derecognition and full accrual accounting treatment under the guidance for real estate sales.
1059142_12_ITEM2_P2_S3	As a result, the Company continues to consolidate these Ohio Properties as if they were owned (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for each of the consolidated properties as of December 31, 2011 :
1059142_12_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the properties collateralizing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are subject.
1059142_12_ITEM5_P0_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_12_ITEM5_P0_S1	The rights and obligations of unitholders are set forth in the Partnership's Agreement of Limited Partnership.

1059142_12_ITEM6_P0_S0	Set forth below is selected financial data for the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2007 through 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in response to Item 8 of this report.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P0_S2	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and it's effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K:
1059142_12_ITEM6_P1_S0	(1) To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, Tier 2 income due to the general partner (as defined in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative income or expense (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on assets, deferred gain and related interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to consolidated VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P2_S0	The Company uses CAD as a supplemental measurement of its ability to pay distributions.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P2_S1	The Company believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P3_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P3_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership's operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P3_S2	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P3_S3	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P4_S0	The following sets forth a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and the Partnership's CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S2	For the year ended 2011, the Tier II Income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson bond retirement.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S3	For the second quarter of 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier II income.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S4	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove, and from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S5	For 2008, Lake Forest generated approximately $45,000, Fairmont Oaks generated approximately $54,000, and Iona Lakes generated approximately $54,000 of Tier 2 income.
1059142_12_ITEM6_P5_S6	For 2007, Lake Forest generated approximately $231,000 of Tier 2 income.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Partnership refers to America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries which consist of:
1059142_12_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac - see Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P2_S0	Nine multifamily apartments ("MF Properties") owned by various Partnership subsidiaries.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P2_S1	Such subsidiaries hold a 99% limited partner interest in five limited partnerships and 100% member positions in four limited liability companies.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P3_S0	Three apartment properties which are subject to a sales agreement and are also reported as MF Properties (the MF Properties ) - see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company refers to the consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K which include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Partnership, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and three other consolidated entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary ( Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P4_S1	All significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P5_S0	On December 31, 2011 , the Partnership owned 20 federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $188.6 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P5_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 20 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 3,959 rental units located in the states of Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P5_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P5_S3	Each bond is secured by a first mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S0	The three Consolidated VIE multifamily apartment properties as of December 31, 2011 , contained a total of 650 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S1	The properties underlying the fifteen non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage bonds contain a total of 2,947 rental units at December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S2	Two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units are subject to a sales agreement (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S3	As of December 31, 2010 , six of the 21 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were secured by properties held as VIEs which contained 1,152 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S4	As of December 31, 2010 , the properties underlying the 13 non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 2,144 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P6_S5	Two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units are subject to a sales agreement (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P7_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, the Partnership may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties, in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through a sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P7_S1	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P7_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P7_S3	The Partnership expects to provide the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P8_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in five entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 602 rental units together with the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units which are subject to a sales agreement (see Note 2 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P8_S1	In addition, the Partnership's subsidiaries own 100% of four MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village and Weatherford.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P8_S2	Arboretum, Eagle Village and DeCordova contain a total of 732 rental units and once fully constructed Weatherford will contain 76 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P8_S3	As of December 31, 2010 , the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries held limited partnership interests in five entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 602 rental units together with the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units which are subject to a sales agreement.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P8_S4	The MF Properties' operating goal is similar to that of the properties underlying the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S0	In July 2011, the Company closed a $10.0 million financing utilizing a TOB structure with DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S1	The first TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S2	The Company transferred this bond to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S3	In December 2011, the Company closed a second TOB financing structure in the amount of $7.8 million with DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S4	The second TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P9_S5	The Company transferred these bonds to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P10_S0	As of December 31, 2011 the total cost of borrowing for the TOB facilities of 1.97% and 2.28%, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P10_S1	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P10_S2	For financial reporting purposes, the TOB Financings are presented by the Company as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S1	The gross proceeds from TEBS Financing were approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Company applied approximately $49.5 million of these net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, its secured term loan from Bank of America.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S4	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , the total cost of borrowing was 2.05% for the TEBS facility.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P11_S6	As of December 31, 2010 , thetotal cost of borrowing was 2.24%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P12_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting restrictions on the availability of debt financing that had prevailed since 2008 began to subside in 2010 and continued to recover in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P12_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has increased, overall availability remains limited and the cost of credit may continue to be adversely impacted.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P12_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P13_S0	Many participants in the multifamily housing debt sector either reduced their participation in the market or were forced to liquidate some or all of their existing portfolio investments in order to meet their liquidity needs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P13_S1	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P13_S3	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P14_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P14_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P14_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S1	In addition, the economic conditions including a slow job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S2	While some properties have been negatively effected, overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 85% during 2011 as compared to 81% during 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S3	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has increased to approximately 83% during 2011 from 80% during 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S4	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P15_S5	We expect that property operations will improve in 2012 and 2013 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will be continue to be positive.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P16_S0	The following discussion describes the operations and financial results of the individual apartment properties financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and the MF Properties in which it holds an ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P16_S1	The discussion also outlines the bond holdings of the Partnership, discusses the significant terms of the bonds and identifies those ownership entities which are Consolidated VIEs of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P17_S0	(1) Economic occupancy is presented for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P17_S1	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P17_S2	Actual occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented, therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P17_S3	(2) This property is still under construction as of December 31, 2011 , and therefore has no occupancy data.

1059142_12_ITEM7_P72_S3	In July 2011, the Company obtained a $6.5 million construction loan secured by the DeCordova and Weatherford properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P72_S4	This construction loan is being used to fund the completion of Weatherford.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P72_S5	The construction loan is with an unrelated third party and this property is expected to be completed in March 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P72_S6	The Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate property and, upon completion of construction and lease stabilization, will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods (I and II) and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ), were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S3	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S4	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 10.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S5	Both series of bonds mature in June 2050.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S6	The Company had previously acquired a 99% interest in the Ohio Properties as part of its strategy of acquiring existing multifamily apartment properties that it expects will be partially financed with new tax-exempt mortgage bonds at the time the properties become eligible for the issuance of additional LIHTCs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S7	In addition to the new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Company, the plan of financing for the acquisition included other subordinated debt issued by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P73_S8	At the time of acquistion, the new owners had not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P74_S0	Pursuant to accounting guidance for property, plant, and equipment - real estate sales, the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for derecognition of the properties or full accrual accounting for the gain.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P74_S1	The guidance requires sufficient equity at risk as part of a sales transaction to indicate a commitment from the buyer (typically a minimum of 3 to 5% investment by the new owners).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P74_S2	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio Properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P74_S3	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million which has been deferred by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S0	In October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of Boston Capital (the BC Partners ) as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S1	The BC Partners have agreed to contribute approximately $6.7 million to the equity of these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Ohio Properties had not yet achieved these debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners had not contributed a sufficient amount of additional capital to these limited partnerships to allow the Company to deconsolidate the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S3	Accordingly, the Company will continue to report each Ohio Property as an MF Property, and no gain from the 2010 sale of such Ohio Property will be recognized by the Company, until the Ohio Property achieves specified debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners have contributed their additional capital to the limited partnership owning the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S4	The Company expects that each of the Ohio Properties will achieve the debt service coverage ratios so that the BC Partners will fully fund their capital commitments during 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S5	As that occurs, each Ohio Properties will cease to be reported as an MF Property and the Company will recognize the gain for the 2010 sale of the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P75_S6	After that time, the Company will report the tax-exempt mortgage bonds on such Ohio Property as an asset and will report the related interest income on the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P76_S0	In connection with the BC Partners transaction, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P77_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehab, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P77_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur, 25% of the BC equity would remain in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed above.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P77_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote (see Notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P78_S0	Crescent Village - Crescent Village Townhomes is located in Cincinnati, Ohio and contains 90 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P78_S1	The consolidation of Crescent Village's operations resulted in recognition by the Company of net operating income of $324,000 and $146,000 on net revenue of approximately $731,000 and $726,000 in 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P78_S2	The increase in net operating income is the result of a decrease in utility, administration and repair and maintenance expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P78_S3	Crescent Village also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2 in 2010 that was not repeated in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P79_S0	Post Woods - Post Woods Townhomes is located in Reynoldsburg, Ohio and contains 180 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P79_S1	The consolidation of Post Woods' operations resulted in the recognition by the Company of net operating income of $747,000 and $344,000 on net revenue of approximately $1.49 million and $1.36 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P79_S2	The increase in net operating income is a result of an increase in economic occupancy along with a decrease in property insurance, real estate taxes and repair and maintenance expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P79_S3	Post Woods also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2 in 2010 that was not repeated in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P80_S0	Willow Bend - Willow Bend Townhomes is located in Columbus (Hilliard), Ohio and contains 92 units and was acquired in July 2007.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P80_S1	The consolidation of Willow Bend's operations resulted in recognition by the Company of net operating income of $351,000 and $157,000 on net revenue of approximately $788,000 and $776,000 in 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P80_S2	The increase in net operating income is the result of a decrease in property insurance , real estate taxes and utility expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P80_S3	Willow Bend also paid a one-time administration fee to AFCA2 in 2010 that was not repeated in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P81_S0	The tables below compare the results of operations for the Company for 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 :
1059142_12_ITEM7_P82_S0	Property revenues increased mainly as a result of additional MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P82_S1	The Arboretum was acquired on March 31, 2011, and added approximately $1.8 million to property revenues during 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P83_S0	Eagle Village was acquired on June 29, 2011 and added approximately $945,000 to property revenues in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P83_S1	Partially offsetting this increase was an approximately $1.4 million decrease in revenue due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P83_S2	The remaining increase is primarily attributable to the increased economic occupancy at the existing MF Properties year over year.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P83_S3	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties, excluding the Eagle Village student housing project which was acquired in 2011, increased to $7,693 per unit in 2011 from $7,295 in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P83_S4	The annual net rental revenues per unit related to the Consolidated VIEs increased to approximately $6,973 in 2011 from approximately $6,888 in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P84_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income increased during 2011 due to a higher level of bond investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P84_S1	Total bond investments at December 31, 2011 were approximately $135.7 million as compared to approximately $100.6 million at December 31, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P84_S2	Interest payments of approximately $1.9 million were received from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that the Company did not hold during 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P84_S3	The deconsolidation of Iona Lakes resulted in an approximate $635,000 increase in bond investment income during 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P84_S4	In addition, the Company realized approximately $308,000 of contingent interest from the Clarkson College bond retirement in second quarter 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P85_S0	Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P85_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P86_S0	Other income is comprised of three separate items.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P86_S1	Approximately $445,000 is the gain on the Briarwood bond retirement during 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P86_S2	Approximately $144,000 is related to the forgiveness of debt from an unrelated third party related to the DeCordova foreclosure which occurred in first quarter 2011 and the payment of a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P87_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P87_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P87_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000 in 2010 which did not repeat in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S0	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties and the Consolidated VIEs is comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S3	Real estate operating expenses decreased from $10.0 million in 2010 to $9.9 million in 2011 due to the following offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S4	During 2010, approximately $231,000 of administrative fees and approximately $521,000 of acquisition costs paid by the Ohio Properties did not recur in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S5	The deconsolidation of Iona Lakes reduced expenses by approximately $1.0 million 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S6	In addition, due to the Ohio Property rehabilitation, real estate taxes, insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses decreased year over year.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S7	Offsetting these decreases are increased expenses from the new Arboretum property of approximately $1.2 million in 2011, approximately $286,000 of which were acquisition related expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P88_S8	In addition, Eagle Village increased expenses by approximately $667,000 in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P89_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P90_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P90_S1	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $4.2 million was recorded against the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P90_S2	In 2010, approximately $212,000 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan and $350,000 was recorded against the cross collateralized Ashley Square and Cross Creek taxable loans as an allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P91_S0	As a result of a decision by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs to terminate the anticipated Tax Credit Assistance Program funding for the Residences at Weatherford in October 2010, the Company determined that the property fixed assets and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on this project were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P91_S1	The resulting charge was attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P91_S2	In February 2011, the Company completed foreclosure proceedings on the bond issued on this property and now owns the property directly.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P91_S3	No impairment charges were recorded on this project in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P92_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P92_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 is related to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P92_S2	Approximately $742,000 of depreciation expense and approximately $205,000 of in-place lease amortization increases are directly related to the new MF Properties acquired in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P92_S3	This was offset by the reduction of approximately $446,000 depreciation expense due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes and the $197,000 reduction of amortization expense related to reduced deferred financing costs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P92_S4	The remaining increase is attributable to depreciation on newly capitalized and newly acquired assets.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P93_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2011 compared to 2010 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P93_S1	The Company's borrowing cost decreased from approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010 to approximately 2.7% resulting in an approximate decrease of $791,000 when comparing 2011 to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P93_S2	Offsetting this decrease was an approximate $1.3 million increase resulting from the higher average principal of outstanding debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P93_S3	The remaining approximate $2.7 million increase was the result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P93_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P94_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P94_S1	Approximately $179,000 of this increase is due to administration fees paid to AFCA2 as a result of new investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P94_S2	The remaining increase is related to increased salary and insurance expenses offset by a reduction in professional fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S0	Property revenues of the Company consist of those of the MF Properties as well as the six Consolidated VIEs treated as continuing operations during the periods.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S1	Property revenues decreased approximately $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 mainly as a result of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments no longer being reported as Consolidated VIEs in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S2	Accordingly, no revenues from the operation of these properties were included in property revenues reported by the Company in 2010 compared to approximately $1.5 million of property revenues from these properties that were reported in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S3	The decline in property revenue due to the deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek was partially offset by an increase of approximately $300,000 in property revenues generated by Residences at DeCordova which became a Consolidated VIE on March 1, 2010 and general improvements in economic occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S4	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties increased to $7,295 per unit in 2010 from $7,119 in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P95_S5	The annual net rental revenues per unit related to the Consolidated VIEs increased to approximately $6,920 in 2010 from approximately $6,216 in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income of the Company consists of the interest income earned only on the mortgage revenue bonds that were not issued to finance properties owned by Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S1	The deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments increased investment income by approximately $962,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S2	These properties are no longer treated as Consolidated VIEs as of January 1, 2010, therefore the interest paid to the Company on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is no longer eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S3	In addition, the Company realized additional tax-exempt interest income of approximately $1.9 million due to the acquisition of four tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, South Park Ranch Apartments, Brookstone Apartments, Villages at Lost Creek, and Autumn Pines that were not owned during 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S4	These increases were offset by interest income from Residences at DeCordova and Residences at Weatherford which became Consolidated VIEs on March 1, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S5	The interest income related to these bonds is now eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P96_S6	The elimination of DeCordova and Weatherford interest in 2010 totaled approximately $478,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P97_S0	Other income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P97_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P98_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P98_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P98_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P98_S3	There was no similar transaction in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P99_S0	Gain on assets held for sale.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P99_S1	In September 2009, the Partnership sold the Oak Grove Commons apartments, an asset held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for $3.75 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P99_S2	After the deduction of selling expenses, commissions, and cash advances made to the property, the Partnership realized a taxable gain of approximately $863,000 from the sale.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P99_S3	There was no similar transaction in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P100_S0	When comparing 2010 to 2009, a decrease of approximately $1.3 million in real estate operating expenses is the result of the Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments deconsolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P100_S1	This decrease was offset by approximately $428,000 of expenses related to the consolidation of Residences at DeCordova and Residences at Weatherford, an increase of approximately $231,000 in administrative fees, and an increase of approximately $376,000 of acquisition related costs incurred by the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P100_S2	The acquisition costs incurred in 2010 by the Ohio Property owners represent expenses of non-controlling interests.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P100_S3	In addition, there were increases in MF Property related market ready, insurance, and salary expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P101_S0	During 2010, it was determined that a portion of the taxable property loans was potentially impaired and that an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P101_S1	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $212,000 and $700,000 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P101_S2	In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2010, $350,000 was recorded as an allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss against the cross collateralized Ashley Square and Cross Creek taxable loans.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P101_S3	In 2009 the Company recorded a $700,000 allowance for bad debt against the judgment receivable related to the 2008 foreclosure on the Prairiebrook Village bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P102_S0	the Company has determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P102_S1	As of September 30, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership were written down.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P102_S2	The resulting asset impairment charge of approximately $2.5 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P102_S3	In February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership and will continue to develop the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P103_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties, and deferred finance cost amortization written off upon retirement of the BOA Credit Facility in addition to new amortization of finance costs related to the closing of the TEBS Credit Facility.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P103_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to a decrease of approximately $96,000 in deferred financing cost amortization, a decrease of approximately $708,000 of in-place lease amortization, and an approximate $581,000 decrease due to deconsolidation of Ashley Square and Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P103_S2	These were offset by a depreciation expense increase of approximately $200,000 due the consolidation of Residences at DeCordova and an increase of approximately $177,000 due to depreciation on assets added to the existing MF Properties and Consolidated VIEs during 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P104_S0	The decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P104_S1	Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was a result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P104_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P104_S3	The remaining change in interest expense results from changes in the average outstanding debt throughout the year combined with changes in the Company's cost of borrowing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P104_S4	The average outstanding debt decreased slightly while the average cost of borrowing increased slightly from approximately 3.5% per annum in 2009 to approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P105_S0	General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to increased professional fees and administration fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P105_S1	Professional fees increased approximately $258,000 due mainly to accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with the process the Company utilized to respond to a comment letter received by the Company from the Securities Exchange Commission in the first quarter of 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P105_S2	Additional professional fees were also incurred for accounting consultation regarding the implementation of new accounting standards in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P105_S3	Administration fees paid to AFCA 2 increased approximately $335,000 as the Company has a higher level of invested assets and taxable loans in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P105_S4	Offsetting these expenses was a reduction in reimbursable employee related costs paid to AFCA 2.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P106_S0	In February 2009, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest in Evansville, Indiana, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III in Bloomington, Indiana, and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in Louisville, Kentucky were redeemed.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P106_S1	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as a sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P106_S2	The transaction was completed for a total purchase price of $32.0 million resulting in a gain on sale for GAAP reporting to the Company of approximately $26.5 million in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P106_S3	The redemption of the bonds did not result in a taxable gain to the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P106_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2009 net income, excluding the gain on sale, from these VIEs of approximately $347,000 is included in the income from discontinued operations.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P107_S0	The following discussion of the Partnership's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 reflects the operations of the Partnership without the consolidation of the Consolidated VIEs required by the accounting guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P107_S1	The Ohio properties are reflected as MF Properties and not Tax-Exempt Bond Investments in the following discussion.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P108_S0	This information reflects the information used by management to analyze the Partnership's operations and is reflective of the consolidated operations of the Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment and the MF Properties segment as presented in Note 18 to the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S0	Property revenues increased mainly as a result of additional MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S1	The Arboretum was acquired on March 31, 2011, Eagle Village was acquired on June 29, 2011, and DeCordova became an MF Property in the first quarter of 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S2	DeCordova was reported by the Partnership as a bond investment in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S3	Arboretum added approximately $1.8 million, Eagle Village added approximately $945,000, and DeCordova added approximately $607,000 to property revenues in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S4	In addition, the MF Properties that have been in the portfolio since the beginning of 2011 reported higher economic occupancy which contributed approximately $388,000 of additional revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P109_S5	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties excluding the Eagle Village student housing project increased to $7,693 per unit in 2011 from $7,295 in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P110_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due to a higher level of bond investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P110_S1	Total bond investments at December 31, 2011 were approximately $159.4 million as compared to approximately $143.4 million at December 31, 2010 for the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P110_S2	Interest payments of approximately $1.9 million were received from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that the Company did not hold during 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P110_S3	In addition, the Company realized approximately $308,000 of contingent interest from the Clarkson College bond retirement in second quarter 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P110_S4	These increases were offset by less interest earned due to bond restructuring required to execute the TEBS financing facility and the Clarkson bond retirement.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P111_S0	Other income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P111_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P112_S0	Other income is comprised of two main items.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P112_S1	Approximately $445,000 is the gain on the Briarwood bond retirement during 2011 and the payment of a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P113_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P113_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P113_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000 in the 2010 and did not repeat in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S0	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties is comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S3	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was related to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S4	DeCordova was reported by the Partnership as a bond investment during the ten months in 2010, but was reported as an MF Property during 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S5	This reporting change combined with the addition of Arboretum and Eagle Village contributed to a net increase of approximately $1.9 million in real estate expenses in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S6	Arboretum also added approximately $286,000 of acquisition fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S7	During 2010, approximately $231,000 of administrative fees and approximately $521,000 of acquisition costs were incurred by the Ohio Properties and were not repeated in 2011 thereby offsetting the increases.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P114_S8	In addition, due to the Ohio Property rehabilitation, real estate taxes, insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenses decreased year over year.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P115_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P116_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P116_S1	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $4.2 million was recorded against the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P116_S2	In 2010 an allowance for loan loss of approximately $1.1 million was recorded against taxable loans.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P117_S0	As a result of a decision by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs to terminate the anticipated Tax Credit Assistance Program funding for the Residences at Weatherford in October 2010, the Company determined that the property fixed assets and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on this project were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P117_S1	The resulting charge was attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P117_S2	In February 2011, the Company completed foreclosure proceedings on the bond issued on this property and now owns the property directly.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P117_S3	No impairment charges were recorded on this project in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P118_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P118_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 is related to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P118_S2	Approximately $934,000 of depreciation expense and approximately $205,000 of in-place lease amortization increases are directly related to the new MF Properties acquired in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P118_S3	This was offset by the reduction of approximately $197,000 in amortization expense related to reduced deferred financing costs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P118_S4	The remaining increase is attributable to depreciation on newly capitalized and newly acquired assets.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P119_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2011 compared to 2010 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P119_S1	The Company's borrowing cost decreased from approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010 to approximately 2.7% resulting in an approximate decrease of $791,000 when comparing 2011 to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P119_S2	Offsetting this decrease was an approximate $1.3 million increase resulting from the higher average principal of outstanding debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P119_S3	The remaining approximate $2.7 million increase was the result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P119_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P120_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P120_S1	Approximately $179,000 of this increase is due to administration fees paid to AFCA2 as a result of new investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P120_S2	The remaining increase is related to increased salary and insurance expenses offset by a reduction in professional fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P121_S0	Property revenues of the Partnership consists only of those of the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P121_S1	The overall increase was the result of the increase related to Greens of Pine Glen which was owned for the entire 2010 year as compared to ten months in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P121_S2	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties increased to $7,295 per unit in 2010 from $7,119 in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S0	Mortgage revenue bond investment income of the Partnership consists of the interest income earned on the mortgage revenue bonds actually held by the Partnership during the respective periods including the bonds secured by properties owned by Consolidated VIEs that are eliminated in consolidation in the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S1	The decrease in mortgage revenue bond investment income during 2010 compared to 2009 is mainly the result of the redemption of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in February 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S2	These bond redemptions resulted in the recognition of $2.5 million of contingent and deferred interest plus approximately $313,000 of regular bond interest in 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S3	In addition, approximately $164,000 of interest income was recorded in 2009 related to the Oak Grove and Prairiebrook bonds which were not held in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S4	These decreases were partially offset by additional tax-exempt interest payments of approximately $2.2 million received by the Partnership during 2010 due mainly to the acquisition of new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on Cross Creek Apartments, South Park Ranch Apartments, Brookstone Apartments, Villages at Lost Creek, and Autumn Pines.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P122_S5	Due to the uncertainty in collections of contingent interest, the Partnership recognizes this as income only when it is realized.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P123_S0	Gain on assets held for sale.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P123_S1	In September 2009, the Partnership sold the Oak Grove Commons apartments, an asset held for sale, to an unaffiliated party for $3.75 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P123_S2	After the deduction of selling expenses, commissions and cash advances made to the property, the Partnership realized a taxable gain of approximately $863,000 from the sale.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P123_S3	There was no similar transaction in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P124_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P124_S1	In June 2010, the Partnership had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P124_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P125_S0	Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P125_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P126_S0	The bond redemptions secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest, Woodbridge Apartments of Bloomington III and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in February 2009 resulted in a loss from the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P127_S0	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties are comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P127_S1	Real estate operating expenses increased as a result of an increase of approximately $231,000 in administrative fees, and an increase of approximately $376,000 of acquisition related costs incurred by the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P127_S2	The acquisition costs incurred in 2010 by the Ohio Property owners represent expenses of non-controlling interests.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P127_S3	In addition, there were increases in MF Property related market ready, insurance, and salary expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P128_S0	During 2010 it was determined that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and that an additional allowance for loan loss should be recorded.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P128_S1	An allowance for loan loss of approximately $1.1 million and $700,000 was recorded against the property taxable loans during 2010 and 2009, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P128_S2	Additionally, in 2009 a $700,000 allowance for bad debt was recorded against the judgment receivable related to the 2008 foreclosure on the Prairiebrook Village bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P129_S0	the Partnership has determined that the property fixed assets of Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P129_S1	As of September 30, 2010 the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership were written down.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P129_S2	The resulting impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P129_S3	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the current ownership and will continue to develop the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P130_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization written off upon retirement of the BOA Credit Facility in addition to new amortization of finance costs related to the closing of the TEBS Credit Facility.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P130_S1	The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from 2009 to 2010 is attributable to a decrease of approximately $96,000 of deferred financing cost amortization and a decrease of approximately $708,000 of in-place lease amortization which are fully amortized.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P130_S2	The remaining difference is directly related to an increase in depreciation expense on the existing MF Properties due to newly capitalized assets.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P131_S0	The decrease in interest expense of $1.7 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P131_S1	Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was a result of the mark to market adjustment of the Partnership 's derivatives.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P131_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P131_S3	The remaining change in interest expense results from changes in the average outstanding debt throughout the year combined with changes in the Partnership 's cost of borrowing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P131_S4	The average outstanding debt decreased slightly while the average cost of borrowing increased slightly from approximately 3.5% per annum in 2009 to approximately 3.6% per annum in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P132_S0	General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to increased professional fees and administration fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P132_S1	Professional fees increased approximately $258,000 due mainly to accounting, legal and other professional fees associated with the process the Partnership utilized to respond to a comment letter received by the Partnership from the Securities Exchange Commission in the first quarter of 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P132_S2	Additional professional fees were also incurred for accounting consultation regarding the implementation of new accounting standards in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P132_S3	Administration fees paid to AFCA 2 increased approximately $335,000 as the Company has a higher level of invested assets and taxable loans in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P132_S4	Offsetting these expenses was a reduction in reimbursable employee expenses paid to AFCA 2.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S0	Primary sources and uses of funds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S1	Tax-exempt interest earned on the mortgage revenue bonds, including those financing properties held by Consolidated VIEs, represents the Partnership's principal source of cash flow.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S2	The Partnership may also receive cash distributions from equity interests held in MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S3	Tax-exempt interest is primarily comprised of base interest payments received on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S4	Certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds may also generate payments of contingent interest to the Partnership from time to time when the underlying apartment properties generate excess cash flow.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S5	Because base interest on each of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds is fixed, the Partnership's cash receipts tend to be fairly constant period to period unless the Partnership acquires or disposes of its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P133_S6	Changes in the economic performance of the properties financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with a contingent interest provision will affect the amount of contingent interest, if any, paid to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by their real estate investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P135_S0	The economic performance of a multifamily apartment property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P135_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P135_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P135_S3	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P136_S0	The primary uses of cash by apartment properties are the payment of operating expenses and debt service.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P137_S0	Other sources of cash available to the Partnership include debt financing, mortgages and the sale of additional BUCs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Company currently has outstanding debt financing of $112.7 million under three separate credit facilities and mortgages of $46.2 million secured by six MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S0	The Partnership's principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to unitholders, interest and principal on debt financing and general and administrative expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S1	The Partnership also uses cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S2	Distributions to unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S3	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by the Partnership from its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of the Partnership's outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by the Partnership on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by the Partnership and the number of units outstanding.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.35 per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S5	See Cash Available for Distribution, on a following page within item 7.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S6	As a result, the Partnership was required to supplement its cash available for distribution during 2011 with unrestricted cash and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current investment plans.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S7	The General Partner believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able meet its liquidity requirements, including the payment of expenses, interest on its debt financing, and cash distributions to unitholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of unrestricted cash.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P138_S8	However, if actual results vary from current projections and the actual CAD generated is less than the new regular distribution, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P139_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary uses of cash are: (i) the payment of operating expenses; and (ii) the payment of debt service.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P140_S0	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P140_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the debt outstanding related to the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio of approximately $197.3 million plus restricted cash results in a leverage ratio of 57%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P141_S0	The outstanding debt financing arrangements are two TOB facilities with Deutsche Bank and the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac, discussed above (see Note 9).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P141_S1	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $46.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P141_S2	These mortgage loans mature at various times from May 2012 through November 2013 (see Note 10).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P141_S3	The total debt financing plus mortgage loans of $158.9 million results in a leverage ratio to Total Assets of 53%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S1	The gross proceeds from TEBS Financing were approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S3	The Company applied approximately $49.5 million of these net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, its secured term loan from Bank of America.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S4	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P142_S5	Under the TEBS Financing, the Company transferred the 13 bonds, with a total outstanding principal amount of approximately $125.6 million, to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Company (the Sponsor ).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P143_S0	In order to meet Freddie Mac's underwriting requirements with respect to the multifamily apartment properties financed by certain of the Bonds, the Sponsor was required to first place eight of the Bonds, with a total outstanding principal of approximately $70.5 million, into a separate custodial trust with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Custodial Trust ) that issued senior and subordinated custody receipts ( Custody Receipts ) representing beneficial interests in the Bonds held in the Custodial Trust to the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P143_S1	The subordinated Custody Receipts with a total principal amount of approximately $9.5 million were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P143_S2	The senior Custody Receipts, with a total principal amount of approximately $61.0 million, along with the remaining five Bonds that were not placed into the Custodial Trust, with a total principal amount of approximately $55.1 million, were then securitized by transferring these assets to Freddie Mac in exchange for the TEBS Certificates issued by Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S0	The TEBS Certificates represent beneficial interests in the securitized assets held by Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S3	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly SIFMA floating index rate plus certain Facility Fees.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S4	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.25% and the total Facility Fees were 1.9%, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 2.15%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S5	As of December 31, 2011 , the SIFMA rate was equal to .15% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.05%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P144_S6	As of December 31, 2010 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.34% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.24%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates are made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S3	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S4	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P145_S5	The Company also entered into various subordination and intercreditor agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Company has subordinated its rights and remedies with respect to the taxable mortgage loans made by it to the owners of properties securing certain of the Bonds to the rights of Freddie Mac as the holder of the Bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P146_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the TEBS Financing is presented by the Company as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P147_S0	The TEBS Financing offers several advantages over the Company's previous credit facilities which, over time, are expected to positively impact the generation of CAD.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P148_S0	a lower initial cost of borrowing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S0	The second and third credit facilities in place at December 31, 2011 are financings which utilize a TOB structure with DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S1	In July 2011, the Company closed a $10.0 million financing utilizing a TOB structure with the DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S2	This first TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S3	In December 2011, the Company closed a second TOB financing structure in the amount of $7.8 million with DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S4	This second TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S5	Under the TOB structure, the Company transfers the related bonds to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S6	The TOB trustee then issued SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S7	The SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S8	The SPEARS were credit-enhanced by DB and sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S9	The gross proceeds from the sale of the SPEARS were remitted to the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S10	The LIFERS were retained by the Company and are pledged to DB to secure certain reimbursement obligations.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P149_S11	The effective interest rate for the two TOB facilities was 1.86% as of December 31, 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P150_S0	The Partnership is authorized to issue additional BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P150_S1	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P150_S2	In April 2010, the Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P150_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.7 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P151_S0	Cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P151_S1	Beginning with the distribution for the second quarter of 2009, the Partnership's annual distribution was reduced from $0.54 per unit to $0.50 per unit due to the General Partner's determination that higher borrowing costs and other factors would reduce the cash available to the Partnership to make distributions.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S0	On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased approximately $8.0 million compared to the same period a year earlier mainly due to improved operations as net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, asset impairment charges, provisions and derivative mark-to-market changes improved approximately $4.3 million from approximately $7.0 million in 2010 to approximately $11.3 million in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S1	Changes in working capital components accounted for the remaining improvement in operating cash flow.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S2	Cash used for investing activities improved approximately $16.7 million in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S3	The change in restricted cash from 2010 to 2011 comprises the majority of the decrease in cash used.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S4	The remaining changes in investing activities is the net result of cash used to acquire the Arboretum Apartment and Eagle Village Student Housing properties; the Briarwood Manor, GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax-exempt and taxable bonds offset by the release of cash upon foreclosure of the DeCordova and Weatherford properties; the retirement of the Clarkson College and Briarwood Manor bonds; and the repayment of a taxable loan by the Foundation for Affordable Housing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S5	Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased approximately $13.8 million compared to 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S6	Financing cash flows in 2011 consisted mainly of cash inflows from additional borrowings offset by distribution payments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P152_S7	Financing cash flows in 2010 consisted mainly of cash inflows from the sales of BUCs offset by principal payments on debt and distributions.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P153_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P153_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P153_S2	To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, certain income due to the General Partner (defined as Tier 2 income in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative expense or income (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on bonds, losses related to Consolidated VIEs including the cumulative effect of accounting change, and depreciation and amortization expense are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P154_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P154_S1	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P155_S0	In October 2011, the Briarwood Manor bond was called and retired at par plus accured interest for approximately $4.9 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P155_S1	This transaction resulted in approximately $445,000 gain reported in the fourth quarter.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P155_S2	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P156_S0	Upon redemption of the Clarkson College bond in May 2011, the Company realized approximately $308,000 in contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P156_S1	Contingent interest is Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S0	During June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, the Ohio Properties, were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity (see Note 3).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S1	Pursuant to the accounting guidance related to property, plant, and equipment for real estate sales, the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for decrecognition of the properties and full accrual accounting treatment for the resulting gain.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S2	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S3	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S4	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a deferred gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S5	As the deferred gain on the transaction represents cash paid to the Company and no on-going legal obligations related to the Ohio Properties or potential obligation to repay any amounts exists, the deferred gain is CAD and is shown as an adjustment in the CAD Calculation below.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P157_S6	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Partnership has made annual cash distribution of $0.50 per unit since 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P158_S1	Since realized CAD per unit was less than $0.50 per unit, the Partnership used approximately $3.9 million and $3.1 million of unrestricted cash to supplement the deficit in 2011 and 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P158_S2	The General Partner believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to unitholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P158_S3	However, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be unable to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P158_S4	In that case, the annual distribution rate per unit may need to be reduced.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P159_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 .
1059142_12_ITEM7_P160_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P160_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P160_S2	For the year ended 2011, the Tier II Income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson bond retirement.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P160_S3	For the second quarter of 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier II income.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P160_S4	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove, and contingent interest from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P161_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Partnership held tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by multifamily housing projects.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P161_S1	The multifamily housing projects are owned by entities that are not controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P161_S2	The Partnership has no equity interest in these entities and does not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P161_S3	Some of the ownership entities are deemed to be Consolidated VIEs and are consolidated with the Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P161_S4	The VIEs that are consolidated with the Partnership do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P162_S0	The Partnership does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P162_S1	As such, the Partnership is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P163_S0	The Partnership does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Partnership or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 12 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Partnership has the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011:
1059142_12_ITEM7_P165_S0	As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2012 consist of the paydowns on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB credit facilities with Deutsche Bank and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P165_S1	The Partnership plans to refinance or retire the current maturing mortgage in the second quarter of 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P166_S0	With respect to the financial results of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the multifamily residential properties, which collateralize the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P166_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P166_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P166_S3	Inflation did not have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P167_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P167_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P167_S2	All of the Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P167_S3	The Company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies because they involve judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P167_S4	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P168_S0	Accounting for the TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements The Company evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P168_S1	In accordance with the guidance which outlines the conditions that must be met to derecognize a transferred financial asset, in part, the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either of the following:
1059142_12_ITEM7_P169_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P169_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P169_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P170_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P170_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P170_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P170_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to derecognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P170_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the residual participating interests ("LIFERS") so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P171_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of the consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P171_S1	As part of the TEBS Financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P171_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P171_S3	Other bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TOB Trust with Deutsche Bank ( DB ).
1059142_12_ITEM7_P171_S4	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests ("SPEARS") and LIFERS.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P172_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P172_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are a VIE and the LIFERS owned by the Partnership creates a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P173_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and the TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P174_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P174_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P174_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P174_S3	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to call the bonds within the trusts.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Partnership considered the related party relationship of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P175_S1	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P176_S0	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P176_S1	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P177_S0	The Partnership invests in federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P177_S1	The Partnership owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P177_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P177_S3	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P178_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new provisions of the consolidation guidance that amended the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and required enhanced disclosure to provide more information about the Company's involvement in a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P179_S0	The Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P180_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack: i. the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights; ii.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P180_S1	the obligation to absorb the expected loss of the entity; or iii.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P180_S2	the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P181_S0	The revised accounting standard introduced a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P181_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P181_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners were VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership was the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P181_S3	The guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P182_S0	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of entities which are secured by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P182_S1	On January 1, 2010, the Partnership determined that eight of the entities financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P182_S2	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes, Lake Forest, DeCordova, and Weatherford.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P182_S3	The Partnership then determined that it was the primary beneficiary of six of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes and Lake Forest, DeCordova and Weatherford and reported these six properties as Consolidated VIEs during 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P182_S4	As a result of adopting the new guidance on January 1, 2010, the Partnership no longer reports Ashley Square and Cross Creek on a consolidated basis.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford and one of the Partnership's subsidiaries took 100% ownership interest in these limited liability companies.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S1	As a result, the properties are reported as MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S2	In June 2011, the ownership of Iona Lakes became a not-for-profit entity, which created a re-consideration event and resulted in Iona Lakes no longer being reported as a Consolidated VIE beginning June 1, 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S3	At December 31, 2011 , the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of three of the remaining VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S4	At December 31, 2011, the Partnership holds four bonds which were purchased after January 1, 2010, Autumn Pines, GMF-Madison Tower, GMF-Warren/Tulane, and Lost Creek.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P183_S5	The evaluation of these entities did not result in required consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P184_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P184_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities' ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S0	Investments in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds, Other Tax-Exempt Bonds, and Property Loans Valuation - As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Company owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S3	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S5	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P185_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P186_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P187_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S1	At December 31, 2011 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 6.3% to 9.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S3	Assuming an immediate 10 percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.9% to 9.9% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $10.7 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P188_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P189_S0	The estimated future cash flow of each revenue bond depends on the operations of the underlying property and, therefore, is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts, future real estate operating expenses, and future capital expenditures.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P189_S1	Such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the property operates, the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets, and tax and insurance expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P189_S2	Different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may provide different results.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P189_S3	The Partnership periodically compares its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P190_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P190_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_12_ITEM7_P191_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P192_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P192_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P193_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P193_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P193_S2	The model reflects the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying property over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bond in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P193_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make numerous subjective assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_12_ITEM7_P194_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P195_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P196_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P196_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P197_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P198_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P199_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P199_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P199_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P200_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P200_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P200_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P200_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P201_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P202_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P203_S0	Evaluation of property loans for potential losses - In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P203_S1	All of these loans are made on a non-recourse basis.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P203_S2	As a result, the repayment of these loans depend on the cash flows generated by the underlying property.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P203_S3	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P203_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the property and compares the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P204_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property's fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P204_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P204_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property's fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P205_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P205_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P206_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P207_S0	Revenue recognition - tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds - Interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is payable solely from the net cash flow of the underlying properties and reserve funds, if any, set aside pursuant to the bond documents.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P207_S1	These bonds are not the obligations of the state or local housing authorities that issued them and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P208_S0	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P208_S1	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P208_S2	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P208_S3	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P208_S4	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P209_S0	Revenue Recognition - investments in real estate - The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P209_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P210_S0	The Partnership's investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P210_S1	The guidance requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their fair values.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P210_S2	In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, derivative instruments must be appropriately designated, documented and proven to be effective as a hedge.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P210_S3	The Partnership did not designate its current derivatives as qualifying hedges.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P211_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P211_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P211_S2	The fair value adjustment through earnings can cause a significant fluctuation in reported net income although it has no impact on the Partnership's cash flows.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P212_S0	Although the Company utilizes current price quotes by recognized dealers as a basis for estimating the fair value of its interest rate derivative agreements, the calculation of the fair value involves a considerable degree of judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM7_P213_S0	For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see footnote 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Partnership's primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Partnership's exposure to market risks relates primarily to its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and its debt financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The Partnership bases the fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which have a limited market, on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P1_S1	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P1_S2	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P2_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , all of the Partnership 's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management's discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P2_S1	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P2_S2	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P3_S0	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership 's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P4_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P4_S1	The nature of the Partnership's investment in the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the debt financing used to finance these investments exposes the Partnership to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P4_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear base interest at fixed rates and may additionally pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P4_S3	As of December 31, 2011 , the weighted average base rate of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 6.2%.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P4_S4	Accordingly, the interest income generated by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is generally fixed, except to the extent the underlying properties generate enough excess cash flow to pay contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P5_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Partnership has a $94.9 million TEBS financing agreement that provides for interest at a floating rate equal to weekly SIFMA plus 190 basis points.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P5_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The effective interest rate for this credit facility as of December 31, 2011 was 2.05% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P5_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2011, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $950,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Partnership has $17.7 million in two TOB facilities that provide for interest at floating rates based on weekly SIFMA plus an average of 194 basis points.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P6_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The effective interest rate for the two TOB facilities as of December 31, 2011 was 1.86% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P6_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2011, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $177,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P7_S0	The interest rate of the mortgage financing on the MF Properties fluctuates based on the LIBOR.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Accordingly, the cost of borrowing on the debt will increase as the LIBOR increases.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P7_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the outstanding balance of the mortgage financing of the MF Properties was $46.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P7_S3	The weighted average effective interest rate for 2011 on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2011 was approximately 4.2% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P7_S4	If the average LIBOR Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2011 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $463,000.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In conjunction with the TEBS Financing and the payment of the Bank of America credit facility, the $50.0 million interest rate derivative purchased on June 18, 2009, was terminated.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The $4.5 million interest rate cap agreement with Bank of America relates to the Glynn Place mortgage loan and was not renewed in 2011 when the mortgage was extended as discussed in Note 10.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership's interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2010:
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P11_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 , as compared to an increase of approximately $572,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P12_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $1.3 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The fair value of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which bear fixed base interest rates, is also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P13_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of the bonds to decrease.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P13_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the bonds do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners' capital and book value per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P13_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the bonds decreases, the Partnership may need to provide additional collateral for its debt financing.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P14_S0	The Partnership's primary credit risk is the risk of default on its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans collateralized by the multifamily properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P14_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P14_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P14_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P15_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P16_S0	A property's ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P17_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P17_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P17_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , based on an accumulation of individual circumstances, the Partnership has identified the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for which certain actions were necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , Woodland Park owes the Partnership approximately $15.7 million under tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and approximately $914,000 under a taxable loan.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S2	This taxable loan has a full reserve recorded against it at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S3	Based on the impairment evaluation (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method), the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond existed at December 31, 2011 and 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S4	However, the evaluation identified the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S5	There was no interest receivable allowance recorded at December 31, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P18_S6	The Partnership will continue to monitor these investments for changes in circumstances that might warrant an impairment charge.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P19_S0	During the impairment evaluation at December 31, 2011, the Partnership identified an impairment of the Iona Lakes approximate $7.3 million taxable loan as a result of a change in the long-term outlook for this property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P19_S1	Based on the projected future occupancy rates used in our 2011 discounted cash flow model, a resulting loan loss charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $4.2 million was recorded which is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Defaults on its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S1	In addition, if a property's net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S2	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan secured by the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S3	In the event of a default on a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S4	If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P20_S5	However, such amounts will no longer represent tax-exempt interest to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P21_S0	The Partnership's primary method of managing the credit risks associated with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans is to perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these mortgage bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance of such property on a continuous basis.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P22_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2011 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_12_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks on the Partnership will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating strategies at that time and overall business and economic environment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Partners of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P5_S0	As discussed in Note 5, the consolidated financial statements include total tax-exempt investments valued at approximately $135,700,000 (45% of total assets) and $100,600,000 (42% of total assets) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P5_S1	At December 31, 2011 and 2010 , management's estimates were based on discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P6_S0	As discussed in Note 2, the Company has changed its method of presenting comprehensive income in 2011 due to the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P6_S1	The change in presentation has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P7_S0	As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted guidance related to the consolidation of Variable Interest Entities effective January 1, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 2, 2012 , expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1059142_12_ITEM8_P15_S0	AMERICA FIRST TAX EXEMPT INVESTORS, L.P.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P16_S0	America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P16_S1	Interest on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P16_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P17_S0	Our general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under provisions of its Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P18_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership, the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest, three entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ), and two bonds secured by the three properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ) subject to a sales agreement (Note 3) which are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P19_S0	Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new provisions of the consolidation guidance included in Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations, that amended the consolidation guidance applicable to VIEs and the definition of a VIE, and requires enhanced disclosures to provide more information about an enterprise's involvement in a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P19_S1	Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P20_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P21_S0	The revised accounting standard utilizes a more qualitative approach to evaluating VIEs for consolidation and requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P21_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P21_S2	Upon adoption of this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P21_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P21_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P22_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P23_S0	The adoption of these provisions on January 1, 2010, resulted in the deconsolidation of certain entities previously included in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P23_S1	Through the continual reconsideration criteria, effective March 1, 2010, two additional entities determined to be VIEs were consolidated in 2010 and one entity was deconsolidated in 2011 (Note 4).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P24_S0	Stand-alone financial information of the Partnership reported in this Form 10-K includes only the financial position and results of operation of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P24_S1	In the Company's consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P25_S0	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of the VIEs for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to Beneficial Unit Certificate ( BUC ) holders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P26_S0	Purchase Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on business combinations, the Company allocates the total acquisition cost of a property acquired to the land, building and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P26_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P27_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P27_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been temporarily increased to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S2	At various times the cash balances may exceed the $250,000 limit.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P29_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company's portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P30_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash, which is legally restricted to use, is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balances, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P30_S1	At December 31, 2011, certain of our credit facilities require restricted cash balances as additional collateral.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P30_S2	Specifically, the tax-exempt bond securitization ("TEBS") facility, discussed below, required approximately $8.0 million, and two of the mortgages required approximately $2.9 million held as restricted cash balances.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Other Tax-Exempt Bonds The Company accounts for its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P31_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P31_S2	All of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P31_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the tax-exempt interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P32_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P32_S1	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P32_S2	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P32_S3	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P32_S4	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P34_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P35_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P35_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P36_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serve as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property that serves as collateral on the bond and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P36_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than- temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P36_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions the most significant of which include:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P37_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P38_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P39_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P39_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models was 7.0% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable market rate for multifamily properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P40_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P41_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P42_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P42_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P42_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S4	The difference between the amortized cost basis and the discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate represents the credit loss.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P43_S5	Any residual decline in value would be considered the interest related loss or non-credit loss.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P44_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P45_S0	If the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company owns some tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P46_S1	The discount is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in mortgage revenue bond investment income in the current period.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company eliminates the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P48_S0	Variable interest entities ( VIEs ) When the Partnership invests in a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is collateralized by a multifamily property, the Partnership will evaluate the entity which owns the property financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond to determine if it is a VIE as defined by the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P49_S0	The guidance on consolidations is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P49_S1	If it is determined that the entity is a VIE, the Partnership will then evaluate if it is the primary beneficiary of such VIE, by determining whether the Partnership will absorb the majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns, or both.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P49_S2	If the Partnership determines itself to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the assets, liabilities and financial results of the related multifamily property will be consolidated in the Partnership's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P49_S3	As a result of such consolidation, the tax-exempt or taxable debt financing provided by the Partnership to such consolidated VIE will be eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P49_S4	However, the Partnership will continue to receive interest and principal payments on such debt and these payments will retain their characterization as either tax-exempt or taxable interest for income tax reporting purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P50_S0	Since the Partnership has no legal ownership of the VIEs, creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P51_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company's investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P51_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19-40 years on multifamily residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P51_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P52_S0	Management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P52_S1	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P53_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P54_S0	Funding to the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P54_S1	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P55_S0	Based on the termination notice, the Company determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P55_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down to estimated fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P55_S2	The resulting impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P55_S3	In February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership and has begun construction on the Weatherford property (Note 6).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P55_S4	There were no real estate impairment charges recognized in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P56_S0	Property Loans In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of the some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P56_S1	The repayment of these loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralizes the loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralizes the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we evaluate a number of different DCF models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P57_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P57_S2	The Company may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P58_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P58_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P59_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P59_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized a provision for loan losses of approximately $4.2 million, $562,000 and $1.4 million, respectively (Note 7).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P60_S0	Accounting for TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (Note 9) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P60_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P60_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P61_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P61_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P61_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P62_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P62_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P62_S3	As effective control has not been transferred the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P62_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the residual participating interests ("LIFERS") so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P63_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P64_S0	As part of the TEBS Financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P64_S1	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P64_S2	Other bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TOB Trust with Deutsche Bank ( DB ).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P64_S3	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests ("SPEARS") and LIFERS.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P65_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are a VIE and the LIFERS owned by the Partnership create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P66_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S3	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to call the bonds within the trusts.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S4	The Partnership also considered the related party relationship of the entities involved in the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P67_S5	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P68_S0	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P68_S1	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P69_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement, which approximates the effective interest method.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P69_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the stated maturity of the related tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which approximates the effective interest method.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P69_S2	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $5.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P69_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of approximately $1.6 million and $932,000 as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P70_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), requiring entities to present net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P70_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for statements issued by the Company after January 1, 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P70_S2	In December 2011, the FASB Issued ASU 2011, 12, Comprehensive Income, which defers certain portions of ASU 2011-5 and indefinitely deferred the requirement to present classification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P70_S3	The Company early adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2011-05 and ASU No. 2011-12 and accordingly all previous periods have been retrospectively presented.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P71_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P71_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P71_S2	At December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Company evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P71_S3	The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $9.6 million and $13.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively, against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S1	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S2	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S3	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S6	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S7	The Company reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P72_S8	As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest with the exception of the Woodland Park bond (Note 5).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P73_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (Note 6) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P73_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P74_S0	The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P74_S1	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P75_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P75_S1	The Company's interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P75_S2	The Company is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P75_S3	The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P76_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P77_S0	Net Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P77_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P77_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per BUC holder:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P78_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P78_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P78_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P79_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P79_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P79_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of such date.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P79_S3	For purposes of the Agreement of Limited Partnership, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (Note 6) will be included in the Partnership's Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P80_S0	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P80_S1	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P81_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs as of the date of the implementation of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P81_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs' net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P82_S0	The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 were as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods (I and II) and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ), were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S3	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S4	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 10.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S5	Both series of bonds mature in June 2050.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S6	The Company had previously acquired a 99% interest in the Ohio Properties as part of its strategy of acquiring existing multifamily apartment properties that it expects will be partially financed with new tax-exempt mortgage bonds at the time the properties become eligible for the issuance of additional LIHTCs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S7	In addition to the new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Company, the plan of financing for the acquisition included other subordinated debt issued by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P83_S8	At the time of acquistion, the new owners had not contributed any capital to the transaction and the Company effectively provided 100% of the capital structure to the new owners as part of the sale transaction.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P84_S0	Pursuant to accounting guidance for property, plant, and equipment - real estate sales, the sale and restructure does not meet the criteria for derecognition of the properties or full accrual accounting for the gain.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P84_S1	The guidance requires sufficient equity at risk as part of a sales transaction to indicate a commitment from the buyer (typically a minimum of 3 to 5% investment by the new owners).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P84_S2	Under the sales agreement, the Ohio Properties were sold for a total purchase price of $16.2 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P84_S3	Cash received by the selling limited partnerships as part of the sale transaction represents a gain on the sale transaction of approximately $1.8 million which has been deferred by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S0	In October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of Boston Capital (the BC Partners ) as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S1	The BC Partners have agreed to contribute approximately $6.7 million to the equity of these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Ohio Properties had not yet achieved these debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners had not contributed a sufficient amount of additional capital to these limited partnerships to allow the Company to deconsolidate the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S3	Accordingly, the Company will continue to report each Ohio Property as an MF Property, and no gain from the 2010 sale of such Ohio Property will be recognized by the Company, until the Ohio Property achieves specified debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners have contributed their additional capital to the limited partnership owning the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S4	The Company expects that each of the Ohio Properties will achieve the debt service coverage ratios so that the BC Partners will fully fund their capital commitments during 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S5	As that occurs, each Ohio Properties will cease to be reported as an MF Property and the Company will recognize the gain for the 2010 sale of the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P85_S6	After that time, the Company will report the tax-exempt mortgage bonds on such Ohio Property as an asset and will report the related interest income on the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P86_S0	In connection with the BC Partners transaction, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P87_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P87_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur after the $7.8 million of equity has been contributed, 25% of the BC contributed capital would remain as equity in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed above.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P88_S0	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote (Note 15).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P89_S0	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P89_S1	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S0	At December 31, 2010, the Partnership determined that eight of the entities financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes, Lake Forest, Residences at DeCordova ("DeCordova") and Residences at Weatherford ("Weatherford").
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S2	The Partnership then determined that it was the primary beneficiary of six of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, Iona Lakes, Lake Forest, DeCordova and Weatherford and reported these six properties as Consolidated VIEs during 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S3	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by the DeCordova and Weatherford properties and took direct ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S4	As such, these entities are no longer reported as Consolidated VIEs but are reported as MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S5	In June 2011, the ownership of Iona Lakes became a not-for-profit entity and Iona Lakes ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S6	At December 31, 2011 , the Partnership determined that five of the entities financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S7	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P90_S8	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of three of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P91_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P91_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P92_S0	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P93_S0	At December 31, 2011, the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P93_S1	The capital structure of each of these VIEs consists of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P93_S2	The senior debt is in the form of a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the VIEs' total capital.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P93_S3	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P94_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by four individuals, three of which are related parties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P94_S1	Additionally, each of these properties is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, America First Properties Management Company, LLC ( Properties Management ) which is an affiliate of Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P95_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Partnership also considered the related party relationships of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P95_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P96_S0	As a result of consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010, the Company deconsolidated two entities, the Ashley Square and Cross Creek VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P96_S1	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of each VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P96_S2	The significant activities of the VIE that impact the economic performance of the entity include leasing and maintaining apartments, determining if the property is to be sold, decisions relating to debt refinancing, the selection of or replacement of the property manager and the approval of the operating and capital budgets.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P96_S3	As discussed below, while the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P97_S0	Ashley Square - Ashley Square Housing Cooperative acquired the ownership of the Ashley Square apartments in December 2008 from Ashley Square LLC through a warranty deed of transfer and an assumption of debt.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P97_S1	This transfer of ownership constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P98_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P98_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P98_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P99_S0	The VIE is organized as a housing cooperative and the 99% equity owner of this VIE is The Foundation for Affordable Housing ( FAH ), an unaffiliated Nebraska non-profit organization.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P99_S1	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P100_S0	Cross Creek - Cross Creek Apartments Holdings LLC is the owner of the Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P100_S1	On January 1, 2010, Cross Creek Apartment Holdings LLC entered into a new operating agreement and admitted three new members.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P100_S2	These new members committed approximately $2.2 million of capital, payable in three installments including $563,000 on January 1, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P100_S3	The new operating agreement and admission of new owner members constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in the consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P101_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital at risk.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P101_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P101_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P102_S0	The three newly admitted members of this VIE are each unaffiliated with the Partnership and have contributed significant equity capital to the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P102_S1	These members collectively control a 99% interest in the VIE.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P102_S2	The other 1% member of this VIE is FAH, which is also unaffiliated with the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P102_S3	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P103_S0	The following table presents information regarding the carrying value and classification of the assets held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, which constitute a variable interest in Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P104_S0	The following tables provide information about the three VIEs and the six VIEs consolidated at December 31, 2011 and 2010 in the Partnership's financial statements under the provisions of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P104_S1	These schedules also include information on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership which are eliminated in consolidation, as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P104_S2	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds detailed below, the Partnership has made taxable loans to these consolidated VIEs of $10.3 million and $18.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P105_S0	The following tables present the effects of the consolidation of the VIEs on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P106_S0	As discussed above, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P106_S1	The cash flows from the VIEs do not represent cash flows available to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P107_S0	Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 :
1059142_12_ITEM8_P108_S0	Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 :
1059142_12_ITEM8_P109_S0	In February 2009, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by assets of the VIEs presented as discontinued operations as of December 31, 2008 were redeemed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P109_S1	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as the sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P109_S2	The transaction was completed in the first quarter of 2009 for a total purchase price of $32.0 million resulting in a gain on sale for GAAP reporting of approximately $26.5 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P109_S3	The redemption of the bonds did not result in a taxable gain to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P110_S0	On a stand-alone basis, the Partnership received approximately $30.9 million of net proceeds from the bond redemption.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P110_S1	These proceeds represent the repayment of the bond par values plus accrued base interest and approximately $2.3 million of contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P110_S2	The contingent interest, recognized in the first quarter of 2009, represents additional earnings to the Partnership beyond the recurring base interest earned on the bond portfolio.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P110_S3	The contingent interest also represents additional Cash Available for Distribution to the unitholders of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.13 per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S0	Each of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S1	However, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S4	Each tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a first mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and an assignment of rents.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P111_S5	Each of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bears tax-exempt interest at a fixed rate and five of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P112_S0	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Company have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P112_S1	The carrying value of each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 is as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P113_S0	As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P113_S1	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P113_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P114_S0	As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P115_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S1	At December 31, 2011 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 6.3% to 9.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.9% to 9.9% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $10.7 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P116_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P117_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on these tax-exempt bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P117_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the five current bonds that are in an unrealized loss position have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P117_S2	The valuation of all of the current bonds has improved over the prior year.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company has reviewed each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P118_S1	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on the bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P118_S2	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further, the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, or if the Company's intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P119_S0	The Company previously identified three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Company s position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P119_S1	These bonds were Woodland Park, DeCordova and Weatherford.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P119_S2	The Company foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford in February 2011 and one of the Company's subsidiaries took full ownership of these two properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P119_S3	These properties are now classified and presented as MF Properties of the Company as discussed in Note 6.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P120_S0	The Company has evaluated the Woodland Park bond holding for an other-than-temporary decline in value as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P120_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of the Woodland Park bond existed at December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P120_S2	However, the evaluation determined that the interest receivable accrued on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P120_S3	There was no interest receivable allowance recorded at December 31, 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P120_S4	The Partnership will continue to monitor these investments for changes in circumstances that might warrant an impairment charge.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Company's ability to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P122_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P122_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P122_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P122_S3	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P123_S0	The various revenue and expense projections for the Woodland Park property operations are summarized as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P124_S0	Revenue and expenses projected for 2012 are equal to the property budget.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P124_S1	Budgeted revenues of approximately $1.9 million are based on a budgeted average occupancy of 90%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P124_S2	Revenues are projected to grow over the ten years in the model to approximately $2.2 million in year ten based on average annual rental increases of 2% and an average occupancy increasing over time to 93%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P124_S3	Expenses are projected to grow to approximately $1.1 million in year ten based on average annual increases of 2.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P125_S0	The following is a discussion of the circumstances related to the Woodland Park bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P126_S0	In May 2010, there were insufficient funds available for debt service and the property owner did not provide additional capital to fund the shortfall.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P126_S1	As a result, a payment default on the bonds has occurred.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P126_S2	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and started the foreclosure process.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P126_S3	The foreclosure process has been extended and the Partnership cannot estimate when it will be completed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P126_S4	The Partnership continues to enforce its rights as the first lien position.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Partnership believes it will be successful in removing and replacing the general and limited partners of the property owner through foreclosure.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P127_S1	This action would allow a new property owner to re-syndicate the LIHTCs associated with this property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P127_S2	If these LIHTCs can be successfully re-syndicated, it will provide additional capital to the project which can be used to support debt service payments on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds until property operations improve to the point that sufficient cash is generated to pay any past due amounts on the bonds as well as ongoing debt service.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P127_S3	If the re-syndication of LIHTCs is not successful, the Partnership may pursue other options including making additional taxable loans to the property or completing the foreclosure process and taking direct ownership of the property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P128_S0	As of December 31, 2010 , the property had 190 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 81% physical occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P128_S1	As of December 31, 2011 the occupancy had increased to 215 units leased out of a total available units of 236, or 91% physical occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P129_S0	In October 2011, the Briarwood Manor bond was called and retired at par plus accrued interest for approximately $4.9 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P129_S1	This transaction resulted in approximately $445,000 gain reported in the fourth quarter.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P129_S2	The net redemption proceeds were used by the Company to retire its $4.0 million term note with Omaha State Bank.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P129_S3	The Briarwood bond was originally purchased in February 2011 for $4.5 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S0	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired at par a $3.8 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a $315,000 taxable revenue bond secured by the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments, a 147 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S1	These bonds were issued for the acquisition of the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments by an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S2	The tax-exempt bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.75% and matures on December 1, 2046.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S3	The taxable bond carries an annual interest rate of 7.75% and matures on December 1, 2019.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S4	The bonds do not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S5	The Company has determined that the entity which owns GMF-Madison Tower Apartments is an unrelated not-for-profit which under the accounting guidance is not subject to applying the VIE consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P130_S6	As a result, its financial statements are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S0	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired at par an $11.8 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a $485,000 taxable revenue bond secured by the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments, a 448 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S1	These bonds were issued for the acquisition of the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments by an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S2	The tax-exempt bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.75% and matures on December 1, 2046.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S3	The taxable bond carries an annual interest rate of 6.5% and matures on December 1, 2015.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S4	The bonds do not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S5	The Company has determined that the entity which owns GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments is an unrelated not-for-profit which under the accounting guidance is not subject to applying the VIE consolidation guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P131_S6	As a result, its financial statements are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P132_S0	In May 2011, the outstanding Clarkson College tax-exempt revenue bond held by the Company was retired early for an amount equal to the outstanding principal and base interest plus accrued but unpaid contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P132_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the Company carried the investment in the Clarkson College bond at an estimated fair market value of approximately $5.1 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P132_S2	The retirement of the bond resulted in a payment to the Partnership of approximately $6.1 million consisting of approximately $5.8 million in principal, approximately $16,000 of base interest and approximately $308,000 of accrued contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P133_S0	In November 2010, the Company acquired the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for a 250 unit multifamily apartment complex in Humble, Texas (Houston) known as Autumn Pines for approximately $12.3 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P133_S1	The bond par value is $13.4 million with an annual interest rate of 5.8%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P133_S2	The bond purchase price results in a yield to maturity of approximately 7.0% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P133_S3	The bond matures in October 2046.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S0	In June 2010, the Company acquired all of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency in order to provide debt financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of Crescent Village, Post Woods I, Post Woods II and Willow Bend Apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and were issued in two series.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S2	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S3	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 10.0%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S4	Neither series provides for contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P134_S5	Each series of bonds matures in June 2050.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P135_S0	In connection with the bond financing transaction, ownership of the Ohio Properties was conveyed by the Company to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P135_S1	However, because the new ownership entities had no equity capital at the time of purchase and the property operations are the sole source of debt service on the Company's bonds, the Company is required to continue to account for the Ohio Properties as if it is the owner of real estate rather than as a secured lender.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P135_S2	As such, the Company continued to consolidate the Ohio Properties on its financial statements as of December 31, 2011 which, among other things, results in the elimination of the bonds in consolidation (Note 3).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P136_S0	In May 2010, the Company acquired the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for a 261 unit multifamily apartment complex in San Antonio, Texas known as The Villages at Lost Creek for approximately $15.9 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P136_S1	The bond par value is $18.5 million with an annual interest rate of 6.25%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P136_S2	The bond purchase price results in a yield to maturity of approximately 7.55% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P136_S3	The bond matures in June 2041.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Company has determined that the underlying entities that own the Autumn Pines Apartments, Lost Creek Apartments, Brookstone Apartments, South Park Ranch Apartments, GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments, and GMF-Madison Apartments, which are financed by bonds owned by the Partnership do not meet the definition of a VIE and accordingly, their financial statements are not required to be consolidated into the Company's consolidated financial statements under the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P138_S0	Descriptions of certain terms of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P139_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by MF Properties, the Company has acquired through its various subsidiaries 99% limited partner positions in five limited partnerships and 100% member positions in four limited liability companies that own the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P139_S1	The financial statements of these properties are consolidated with those of the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P139_S2	The general partners of these partnerships are unaffiliated parties and their 1% ownership interest in these limited partnerships is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements as non-controlling interests.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P139_S3	The Company expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P139_S4	The Company expects to purchase tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P140_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in twelve entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 1,772 rental units, of which three are located in Ohio and subject to a sales agreement, one is located in Nebraska, two are located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Virginia, one is located in Georgia, one is located in North Carolina, and two are located in Texas.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P141_S0	The Company had the following investments in MF Properties as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 :
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S0	In the third quarter of 2010, the Company purchased a minority interest equal to 8.7% ownership in 810 Schutte Road LLC ("Eagle Village"), a 511 bed student housing facility located in Evansville, Indiana.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S1	The minority interest investment totaled approximately $1.1 million and was presented in other assets.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S2	There was no gain or loss recorded when the Partnership acquired the remaining ownership interest as the approximate $1.1 million estimated fair value of the 8.7% ownership had not changed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S3	In June 2011, the Partnership acquired the remaining ownership interest in Eagle Village.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S4	Approximately $3.1 million of cash on hand plus a conventional mortgage of approximately $8.9 million was used to purchase the remaining ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S5	The mortgage loan carries a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.75% but will not be less than 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S6	On December 31, 2011 this rate was 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S7	This mortgage matures on June 1, 2013.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S8	Eagle Village returned $125,000 to the Company as a preferred return on their investment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S9	The transaction is eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S10	Eagle Village is wholly owned by a subsidiary of the Partnership and was reported as an MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S11	The Partnership plans to operate the property as a student housing facility.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S12	Once stabilized as a student housing property, the Company will seek to restructure the ownership and capital structure through the sale of the property to a student housing not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P142_S13	The Company anticipates it will purchase tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of such a restructuring.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P143_S0	In March 2011, the Partnership purchased The Arboretum on Farnam Drive ("Arboretum"), a 145 unit independent senior living facility located in Omaha, Nebraska, for approximately $20.0 million plus transaction expenses of approximately $267,000 which is recorded within real estate operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P143_S1	The purchase price was funded through a conventional mortgage of $17.5 million and cash on hand.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P143_S2	The mortgage payable is with Omaha State Bank, carries a 5.25% fixed rate and matures on March 31, 2014.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P143_S3	The Partnership intends to restructure the property operations by shifting from an entrance fee rental income model utilized by the prior ownership to a current market rent model.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P143_S4	Upon lease-up and stabilization of the property, projected to occur within the next 12 months, the Partnership expects to sell the property to a 501(c)3 not-for-profit entity and acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by the property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P144_S0	Individually these acquisitions are not material but in the aggregate they must be disclosed pursuant to the business combinations guidance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P144_S1	A condensed balance sheet at the date of acquisition for each of the 2011 acquisitions is included below.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P145_S0	The table below shows the pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Eagle Village and Arboretum properties had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P146_S0	Eagle Village added approximately $945,000 in total revenue and approximately $257,000 net loss to the Partnership since it was acquired on June 29, 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P146_S1	Arboretum added approximately $1.8 million in total revenue and approximately $695,000 net loss to the Partnership since it was acquired on March 31, 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P147_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford and one of the Partnership's subsidiaries took 100% ownership interest in these limited liability companies.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P147_S1	Both properties are reported as MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P147_S2	The following is a discussion of the circumstances related to the DeCordova and Weatherford properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P148_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Granbury, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the property had 72 units leased out of a total available 76, or 95% physical occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P149_S0	As of December 31, 2010, the property had 65 units leased out of total available units of 76, or 86% physical occupancy.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P149_S1	Given the projected demand in the local market, an additional 34 units will be constructed adjacent to the first phase with a projected completion date of August 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P149_S2	There is pre-construction leasing interest for the additional units and we expect rapid stabilization of the additional units.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P149_S3	Upon completion of construction and lease up, the Partnership will consider its options in order to recoup its investment in the overall project.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P150_S0	Residences at Weatherford are currently under construction and will contain 76 units upon completion.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P151_S0	This property is a senior (55+) affordable housing project located in Weatherford, Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P151_S1	The construction of this property has begun and the expected completion date in the second quarter of 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P151_S2	The Partnership intends to fund the construction and stabilization of the property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P151_S3	Further, the Partnership expects to operate the property as a market rate property and will evaluate its options in order to recoup its investment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P152_S0	In July 2011, the Company obtained a $6.5 million construction loan secured by the DeCordova and Weatherford properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P152_S1	This construction loan will be used to fund the completion of Weatherford and the expansion of DeCordova.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P152_S2	The construction loan is with an unrelated third party and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9%, maturing on July 28, 2015.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P152_S3	The balance of this note at December 31, 2011 is $4.7 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P152_S4	This agreement requires $500,000 to be held by the Company as restricted cash.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P153_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby four of the MF Properties were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P153_S1	As the buyer has no equity capital in this transaction and the property operations are the current support for the debt service, the Company, in substance, remains the owner for accounting purposes.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P153_S2	As such, the Company will continue to consolidate the Ohio Properties as if the sale was not completed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P153_S3	The properties will continue to be presented as MF Properties and no gain will be recognized until such time as the transaction meets the criteria for derecognition of the properties and gain recognition can be accounted for as a sale (Note 3).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P154_S0	In addition to the MF Properties, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs in accordance with the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P154_S1	Although the assets of the VIEs are consolidated, the Company has no ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs other than to the extent they serve as collateral for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P154_S2	The results of operations of those properties are recorded by the Company in consolidation but any net income or loss from these properties does not accrue to the unitholders or the general partner, but is instead included in "Unallocated deficit of variable interest entities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P155_S0	As discussed in Note 4, as the result of the foreclosures of the bonds on Residences at DeCordova and on Residences at Weatherford and the merger of the entity owning Iona Lakes, these three entities are no longer consolidated as Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P155_S1	DeCordova and Weatherford are now reflected as MF Properties and Iona Lakes is now reflected as an investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other assets.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P156_S0	The Company consolidated the following properties owned by the VIEs in continuing operations as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 :
1059142_12_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company had the following Other Assets as of dates shown:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P158_S0	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, taxable mortgage loans have been made to the owners of the properties which secure certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and are reported as Other Assets, net of allowance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P158_S1	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable loans for impairment.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P158_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable loan values.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P159_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P159_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P160_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 2 above except that the specific discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was 6.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P160_S1	The Company believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily property could obtain current tax-exempt financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P160_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P160_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principle balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following is a summary of the taxable loans, accrued interest and allowance on amount due at December 31, 2011 and 2010:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P162_S0	In September 2011, the Foundation for Affordable Housing sold its ownership interest in the property securing the taxable loan with the Company and used the sales proceeds to repay approximately $4.5 million principal and interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P163_S0	During 2011, the Partnership advanced additional funds to Cross Creek and Iona Lakes of approximately $381,000 and $618,000, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P163_S1	The Partnership believes that these properties will be self-sufficient from an operating cash flow perspective over the term of the bond but will continue to provide property loan advances to cover their short-term working capital needs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P164_S0	As discussed in Note 4, the Partnership deconsolidated the VIE that owns the Iona Lakes property during 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P164_S1	During 2010, the Partnership deconsolidated the VIEs that own the Ashley Square and Cross Creek properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P164_S2	As a result of these VIEs being deconsolidated, the taxable loan and the corresponding loan loss was recognized in the Partnership financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P164_S3	The 2011 taxable loans impairment evaluations resulted in the Partnership recording a $4.2 million loan loss reserve against the Iona Lakes taxable loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P164_S4	In 2010, the impairment analysis resulted in an additional $562,385 provision for loan loss against the Ashely Square and Cross Creek taxable loans and the $700,000 provision for loan loss in 2009 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P165_S0	The following is a detail of loan loss reserves for the years ended December 31:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P166_S0	Accrued interest not recognized represents interest accrued that the Partnership has determined they are not reasonably assured of collecting.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P166_S1	During 2011, the Partnership recorded an allowance for accrued interest not recognized on Ashley Square, Cross Creek, Iona Lakes, and Woodland Park taxable loans.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P166_S2	Amounts reflected in 2010 relate to accrued interest not recognized on the Woodland Park, Ashley Square, and Cross Creek taxable loans.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, holds an asset held for sale valued at an appraised value of $375,000, along with a receivable of approximately $711,000 representing amounts due from a project owner of Prairebrook Village.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S1	In 2008 the Company foreclosed on the Prairebrook Village bond and obtained a summary judgment against ownership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S2	The Partnership placed liens on assets identified and garnished wages from the judgment parties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S3	In 2009, the Company recorded a $700,000 provision for loan loss reserve against this judgment receivable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S4	In February 2010, the Company was informed that bankruptcy protection may be sought by the judgment party.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P167_S5	This reserve is $711,000 and $700,000 at December 31, 2011 and 2010 while the Company continues to pursue this receivable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P168_S0	In February 2009, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Ashley Pointe at Eagle Crest in Evansville, Indiana, Woodbridge Apartment of Bloomington III in Bloomington, Indiana, and Woodbridge Apartments of Louisville II in Louisville, Kentucky were redeemed.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P168_S1	The properties financed by these redeemed mortgage revenue bonds were required to be consolidated into the Company's financial statements as VIEs under the guidance on consolidations as described below under Effects of Implementation of Consolidation Guidance on Financial Reporting .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P168_S2	During the fourth quarter of 2008, these VIEs met the criteria for discontinued operations under the guidance on property, plant, and equipment and were classified as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P169_S0	In order to properly reflect the transaction under the guidance on consolidations, the Company recorded the redemption of the bonds as a sale of the properties as though they were owned by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P169_S1	The transaction was completed for a total purchase price of $32.0 million resulting in a gain on sale for GAAP reporting to the Company of approximately $26.5 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P169_S2	The redemption of the bonds did not result in a taxable gain to the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P170_S0	As of December 31, 2008, $19.6 million of the total outstanding debt related to the Partnership's bond portfolio has been allocated to discontinued operations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P170_S1	Interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations based on the historical effective rate of the Company's debt financing applied to the debt financing allocated to discontinued operations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P170_S2	The Company allocated to discontinued operations interest expense of $82,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P170_S3	There were no discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P171_S0	On a stand-alone basis, the Partnership received approximately $30.9 million of net proceeds from the bond redemption.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P171_S1	These proceeds represent the repayment of the bond par values plus accrued base interest and approximately $2.3 million of contingent interest.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P171_S2	The contingent interest, recognized in the first quarter of 2009, represents additional earnings to the Partnership beyond the recurring base interest earned on the bond portfolio.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P171_S3	The contingent interest also represents additional Cash Available for Distribution to the unitholders of approximately $1.7 million, or $0.13 per unit.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P172_S0	There are no components of the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P173_S0	There were no revenues, expenses and income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P173_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported approximately $849,000 revenues, $502,000 in expenses , $347,000 in income which were related to discontinued operations excluding the gain on sale of $26.5 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P174_S0	The Company currently has outstanding debt financing of $112.7 million under three separate credit facilities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P174_S1	As of December 31, 2010 , the Company's outstanding debt financing totaled approximately $95.6 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P175_S0	(1) Represents the average effective interest rate, including fees, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and excludes the effect of interest rate caps (see Note 13).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S0	Tender Option Bond Financings In July 2011, the Company closed a $10.0 million financing utilizing a Tender Option Bond ("TOB") structure with the Deutsche Bank ("DB").
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S1	The first TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S2	In December 2011, the Company closed a second TOB financing structure in the amount of $7.8 million with DB.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S3	The second TOB was structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S4	Under the TOB structure, the Company transferred the bonds to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S5	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participation interests ("SPEARS"), and residual participation interests, ("LIFERS").
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S6	The SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S7	The SPEARS were credit-enhanced by DB and sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S8	The gross proceeds from the sale of the SPEARS were remitted to the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P176_S9	The LIFERS were retained by the Company and are pledged to DB to secure certain reimbursement obligations.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P177_S0	The TOB structures discussed above ("TOB trusts") receive all principal and interest payments on the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P177_S1	The holders of the SPEARS are entitled to receive regular payments from the TOB trusts at a variable rate established by a third party remarketing firm that is expected to be similar to the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P177_S2	Payments on the SPEARS will be made prior to any payments on the LIFERS held by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P177_S3	As the holder of the LIFERS, the Company is not entitled to receive payments from the TOB trusts at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all remaining principal and interest paid on the bond after payment due on the SPEARS and payment of trust expenses including trustee, remarketing and liquidity fees.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P177_S4	Accordingly, payments to the Company on the LIFERS are expected to vary over time.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S0	As a result, the TOB trusts essentially provide the Company with a secured variable rate debt facility at interest rates that reflect the prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates paid by the TOB trusts on the SPEARS.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S1	Payments made to the holders of the SPEARS and the amount of trust fees essentially represent the Company's effective cost of borrowing on the net proceeds it received from the sale of the SPEARS.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S2	At closing, the rates paid on the first and second TOBs on the SPEARS was 0.09% and .16% per annum, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S3	In addition, the total fixed trust fees were 1.77% and 2.10% per annum, respectively, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 1.86% and 2.26% per annum, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S4	As of December 31, 2011 the rates paid on the TOBs on the SPEARS were .20% and .18% per annum, resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 1.97% and 2.28%, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P178_S5	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P179_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the ATAX TEBS I, LLC (the Sponsor ) pursuant to the TEBS Financing.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P179_S1	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Partnership with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P179_S2	Effective September 1, 2010, the Partnership transferred the following bonds to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Partnership pursuant to the TEBS Financing.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P179_S3	The par value of the bonds included in this Financing facility as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 are also presented.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S0	In order to meet Freddie Mac's underwriting requirements with respect to the multifamily apartment properties financed by these bonds, the Sponsor was required to first place eight of the Bonds into a separate custodial trust with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the Custodial Trust ) that issued senior and subordinated custody receipts ( Custody Receipts ) representing beneficial interests in the Bonds held in the Custodial Trust to the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S1	The subordinated Custody Receipts were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S2	The senior Custody Receipts along with the remaining five Bonds that were not placed into the Custodial Trust were then securitized by transferring these assets to the TEBS Trust sponsored by Freddie Mac in exchange for tax-exempt Class A and Class B Freddie Mac Multifamily Variable Rate Certificates (collectively, the TEBS Certificates ) issued by Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S3	The TEBS Certificates represent beneficial interests in the securitized assets held by Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S4	The gross proceeds from TEBS Financing were approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S5	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S6	The Company applied approximately $49.5 million of these net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, its secured term loan from Bank of America.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S7	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P180_S8	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P181_S0	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain credit, facility, remarketing and servicing fees (the Facility Fees ).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P181_S1	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.25% and the total Facility Fees were 1.9%, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 2.15%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P181_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.15% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.05% on the outstanding balance on the TEBS Financing facility of $95.0 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P181_S3	As of December 31, 2010, the SIFMA rate was equal to .34% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.24% on the outstanding balance on the TEBS Financing facility of $95.6 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P182_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates will be made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P182_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P182_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P183_S0	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P183_S1	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P183_S2	The Company also entered into various subordination and intercreditor agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Company has subordinated its rights and remedies to the rights of Freddie Mac, as the holder of the Bonds, with respect to the taxable loans made by the Company to the owners of properties securing certain of the bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P183_S3	The term of the TEBS Financing coincides with the terms of the assets securing the TEBS Certificates, except that the Partnership may terminate the TEBS Financing at its option on either September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P183_S4	Should the Partnership not elect to terminate the TEBS Financing on these dates, the full term of the TEBS Financing runs through the final principal payment date associated with the securitized bonds, or July 15, 2050.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P184_S0	For years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 , the Company's average effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the BOA Facility, OSB Facility, TEBS Facility, and TOB Facilities was approximately 2.6% and 3.0%, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P185_S0	The Company's aggregate borrowings as of December 31, 2011 contractually mature over the next five years and thereafter as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P186_S0	The Company reports the mortgage loans secured by certain MF Properties on its consolidated financial statements as Mortgages payable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P186_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , outstanding mortgage loans totaled approximately $46.2 million.

1059142_12_ITEM8_P189_S1	This construction loan will be used to fund the completion of Weatherford and the expansion of DeCordova.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P189_S2	The construction loan is with Pinnacle Bank, an independent third party, and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 5.9%, maturing on July 28, 2015.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P189_S3	This facility had an outstanding balance of $4.7 million at December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P189_S4	This agreement required $500,000 to be held as by the Company as restricted cash.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P190_S0	In June 2011, the Company obtained a conventional mortgage of approximately $8.9 million, which was used to acquire Eagle Village.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P190_S1	The mortgage carries a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 2.75%, but will not be less than 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P190_S2	On December 31, 2011 this rate was 3.5%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P190_S3	This mortgage matures on June 1, 2013.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P191_S0	In May 2011, the Greens of Pine Glen obtained an approximate $4.6 million mortgage loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P191_S1	The mortgage carries a variable interest rate of prime plus 1.00% or 4.25%, whichever is greater.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P191_S2	On December 31, 2011 the rate was 4.25%.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P191_S3	This mortgage matures on May 1, 2014.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P192_S0	In March 2011, the Company purchased Arboretum, an independent senior living facility in Omaha, Nebraska.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P192_S1	A portion of the purchase price was financed with approximately $17.5 million mortgage payable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P192_S2	This mortgage carries a 5.25% fixed rate and matures on March 31, 2014.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P193_S0	The following is a summary of the Mortgage Loans payable on MF Properties:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P194_S0	(1) Represents the average effective interest rate, including fees, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 and excludes the effect of interest rate caps (see Note 13).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company's mortgages payable as of December 31, 2011, contractually mature over the next five years and thereafter as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P196_S0	The Partnership expects each of the MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P196_S1	The proceeds from such sale will be utilized to retire any associated outstanding mortgage loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P196_S2	Should a mortgage loan reach maturity prior to a sale of the associated MF Property, the Partnership would either seek to refinance such mortgage loan or utilize cash reserves to retire the loan.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P196_S3	The Partnership expects to provide tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as part of an overall plan of financing the acquisition of a MF Property by a new property owner.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S0	Issuances of Additional Beneficial Unit Certificates Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S1	Through December 31, 2010, the Partnership had issued a total of 20,285,000 additional BUCs raising net proceeds of approximately $108.2 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $7.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S2	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S3	The most recent issuance was completed in April 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S4	The Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P197_S6	There was no equity raise completed in 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P198_S0	A substantial portion of the Partnership's general and administrative expenses and certain costs capitalized by the Partnership are paid by AFCA 2 or an affiliate and are reimbursed by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P198_S1	The capitalized costs are typically incurred in connection with the acquisition or reissuance of certain tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, debt financing transactions and other capital transactions.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P198_S2	The amounts in the following table represent cash payments to reimburse AFCA 2 or an affiliate for such expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S0	AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, taxable loans collateralized by real property, and other tax-exempt investments for which the owner of the financed property or other third party is not obligated to pay such administrative fee directly to AFCA 2.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , the Partnership paid administrative fees to AFCA 2 of approximately $795,000, $636,000, and $304,000, respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S2	In addition to the administrative fees paid directly by the Partnership, AFCA 2 receives administrative fees directly from the owners of properties financed by certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $160,000, $209,000, and $254,000, in 2011 , 2010 , and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S4	Additionally, in connection with the sale of the Ohio Properties and purchase of the new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of the transaction (see Note 6), the Ohio Properties paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA 2 totaling approximately $231,000 in 2010.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S5	Although these third party administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S6	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P199_S7	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P200_S0	AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P200_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P200_S2	Mortgage placement fees earned by AFCA 2 totaled approximately $407,000, $461,000 and $282,000, in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P201_S0	An affiliate of AFCA 2, America First Property Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ) was retained to provide property management services for Iona Lakes, Bent Tree, Lake Forest, Fairmont Oaks, DeCordova, Eagle Ridge, Crescent Village, Meadowview, Willow Bend, Post Woods I, Post Woods II, Churchland, Glynn Place, Greens at Pine Glen, Ashley Square, Clarkson College (bond retired in May 2011), Cross Creek, and Woodland Park.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P201_S1	The management fees paid to Properties Management amounted to approximately $1.1 million in 2011 , $982,000 in 2010 , and $955,000 in 2009 .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P201_S2	For the Consolidated VIEs, these management fees are not Partnership expenses but are recorded by each applicable VIE entity and, accordingly, have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P201_S3	Such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by the properties owned by the Consolidated VIEs prior to the payment of any interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership on these properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P201_S4	For the MF Properties, these management fees are considered real estate operating expenses.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P202_S0	The owners of three limited-purpose corporations which own apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Company are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Company and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P203_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company has three derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing and mortgages payable.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P203_S1	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P204_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P204_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P204_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P204_S3	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $2.1 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 , as compared to an increase of approximately $572,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P205_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P205_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $1.3 million and $3.4 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P206_S0	Existing fair value guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P206_S1	The guidance on fair value measurements:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P207_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P208_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P209_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P209_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P210_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P211_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P212_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P213_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P214_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S0	Investments in Tax-exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S1	The fair values of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S3	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S4	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S5	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P215_S6	Given these facts, the fair value measurement of the Company's investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P216_S0	The effect of the Company's interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Company's variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P216_S1	The effect of the Company's interest rate swap is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P216_S2	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P216_S3	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P217_S0	Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_12_ITEM8_P218_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P219_S0	The Company calculates a fair market value of each financial instrument using a discounted cash flow model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P219_S1	Below represents the fair market value of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P220_S0	The Company, from time to time, may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P220_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P221_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P221_S1	While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P222_S0	Certain of the MF Properties own apartment properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P222_S1	In connection with the acquisition of partnership interests in these partnerships by subsidiaries of the Company, the Company has agreed to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to recapture of these tax credits to the extent the recapture liability is due to the operation of the properties in a manner inconsistent with the laws and regulations relating to such tax credits after the date of acquisition.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P222_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because management believes that the likelihood of any payments being required there under is remote.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S0	In October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S1	The BC Partners have agreed to contribute approximately $6.7 million to the equity of these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the Ohio Properties had not yet achieved these debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners had not contributed a sufficient amount of additional capital to these limited partnerships to allow the Company to deconsolidate the Ohio Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S3	Accordingly, the Company continues to report each Ohio Property as an MF Property, and no gain from the 2010 sale of such Ohio Property will be recognized by the Company, until the Ohio Property achieves specified debt service coverage ratios and the BC Partners have contributed their additional capital to the limited partnership owning the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S4	The Company expects that each of the Ohio Properties will achieve the debt service coverage ratios so that the BC Partners will fully fund their capital commitments during 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S5	As that occurs, each Ohio Properties will cease to be reported as an MF Property and the Company will recognize the gain for the 2010 sale of the Ohio Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P223_S6	After that time, the Company will report the tax-exempt mortgage bonds on such Ohio Property as an asset and will report the related interest income on the bond.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P224_S0	In connection with the BC Partners transaction, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P225_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P225_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur, 25% of the BC equity would remain in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed above.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P225_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P226_S0	In February 2012, the Partnership obtained a $2.0 million construction loan secured by the DeCordova property to be used to expand the DeCordova campus by constructing a new apartment building adjacent to the existing DeCordova property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P226_S1	This construction loan is with an unrelated third party and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 5.0%, maturing on February 1, 2017.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P227_S0	In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P227_S1	The ASU is a result of joint efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") to develop a single, converged fair value framework that addresses how to measure fair value and the disclosures to be provided.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P227_S2	The ASU expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P227_S3	The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P228_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, which contains new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entity's rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P228_S1	The new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013 and the interim periods therein; retrospective application is required.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P229_S0	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-10, which addresses whether the guidance on real estate sales applies to derecognition events involving subsidiaries that are in-substance real estate.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P230_S0	For public entities, the ASU's amendments are effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after June 15, 2012.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P231_S0	The Company consists of three reportable segments, Tax-Exempt Bond Investments, MF Properties, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P231_S1	In addition to the three reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidating and eliminating entries because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment consists of the Company's portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P232_S1	Such tax exempt bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P232_S2	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company held fifteen tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not associated with Consolidated VIEs and three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds associated with Consolidated VIEs which are bonds that are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P232_S3	Additionally, two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties subject to a sales agreement (Note 3) are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P233_S0	The multifamily apartment properties financed by the 20 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 3,959 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P234_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily apartment properties which are not currently financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P234_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P234_S2	The Partnership's interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P235_S0	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties are subject to a sales agreement (Note 3).
1059142_12_ITEM8_P236_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in an MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P236_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership's CAD.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P237_S0	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company held an interest in nine MF Properties containing a total of 1,410 rental units and three MF Properties subject to a sales agreement containing a total of 362 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P238_S0	Consolidated VIE segment The Consolidated VIE segment consists of multifamily apartment properties which are financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P238_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these Consolidated VIE properties are eliminated from the Company's financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds are held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company does not actually own an equity position in the Consolidated VIEs or their underlying properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P239_S1	As of December 31, 2011 , the Company consolidated three VIE multifamily apartment properties containing a total of 650 rental units.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P240_S0	Management closely monitors and evaluates the financial reporting associated with and the operations of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties and performs such evaluation separately from the other operations of the Partnership through interaction with the affiliated property management company which manages the multifamily apartment properties held by the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P241_S0	Management's goals with respect to the properties constituting the Company's Consolidated VIE and MF Properties reportable segments is to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to (i) make all payments of base interest, and possibly pay contingent interest, on the properties included in the Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment and the Consolidated VIE segment, and (ii) distribute net rental income to the Partnership from the MF Properties segment until such properties can be refinanced with additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds meeting the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P241_S1	In order to achieve these goals, management of these multifamily apartment properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of its properties in their respective market areas.
1059142_12_ITEM8_P242_S0	The following table details certain key financial information for the Company's reportable segments for the three years ended December 31:

1059142_12_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's current disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P1_S1	There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect , the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company's management (including officers of the Burlington Capital Group LLC in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of The Burlington Capital Group LLC (in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership), of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company's management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that evaluation, the Partnership's management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011 .
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 , has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2011 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_12_ITEM9A_P8_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1059142_13_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac and one is securitized and held by Deutsche Bank ("DB") in a Tender Option Bond ("TOB") facility (see Notes 2 and 11).
1059142_13_ITEM1_P2_S1	Three of the entities that own the apartment properties financed by three of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were deemed to be Consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") of the Partnership at December 31, 2012 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P2_S2	Two bonds are secured by three properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ) and two bonds are secured by the Greens of Pine Glen property ("Greens Property") which are reported as discontinued operations (Note 10) and are eliminated upon consolidation in the Company's financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the properties collateralizing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P5_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P6_S0	Because the return to the Partnership from its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the multifamily residential properties which collateralize these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other multifamily rental properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership may also invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by its Agreement of Limited Partnership and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon for the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P7_S1	Under the Agreement of Limited Partnership, these tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P7_S2	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership has two other tax-exempt class of investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts' Certificates ("PHC Certificates") and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS").
1059142_13_ITEM1_P7_S3	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate principal outstanding of $65.3 million at December 31, 2012 and are securitized into three separate TOB Trusts with DB ("PHC Trusts").
1059142_13_ITEM1_P8_S0	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P8_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_13_ITEM1_P8_S2	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P8_S3	The state issued MBS have an aggregate principal outstanding of $31.6 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P8_S4	At December 31, 2012, the MBS have been securitized into five separate TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P9_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and have investment grade ratings by the most recent S P or Moody's rating.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Partnership does this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in the best long-term interest of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Partnership generally does not seek to acquire direct interests in real property as long term or permanent investments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Partnership may, however, acquire real estate securing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S2	In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S3	The Partnership currently holds interests in seven MF Properties containing 1,346 rental units, of which two are located in Nebraska, one is located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Georgia, , and two are located in Texas.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S4	The Ohio Properties and the Greens Property were previously reported each as MF Properties but are now reported as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the Partnership's interests in these properties in connection with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S5	The Partnership expects the MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S6	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S7	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the Partnership's initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S8	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P11_S9	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities as the market for LIHTC syndications continues to strengthen.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P12_S0	Seven of the 20 properties which collateralize the bonds owned by the Partnership are managed by America First Properties Management Company ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership's general partner ("AFCA 2"), which provides property management services for Ashley Square, Iona Lakes Apartments, Bent Tree Apartments, Lake Forest Apartments, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Cross Creek, Woodland Park, and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Ohio Properties and the Greens Property, each is which is reported as discontinued operations but serve as collateral to tax-exempt bonds owned by the Partnership, are also managed by Properties Management.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P12_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P12_S3	The properties not currently managed by Properties Management are Arbors at Hickory Ridge, Autumn Pines, Bella Vista Apartments, Bridle Ridge, Brookstone Apartments, Runnymede Apartments, South Park Ranch Apartments, Vantage at Judson, Villages at Lost Creek, and Woodlynn Village.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P13_S0	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital and (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our unitholders which are substantially exempt from federal income tax.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P13_S1	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily apartment properties, including student housing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P13_S2	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced federally tax-exempt yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed apartment properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P14_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt investments on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of tax-exempt interest available for distribution to our unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P14_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt investments as permitted by the Agreement of Limited Partnership, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the tax-exempt securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P14_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P14_S3	Our operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P14_S4	At December 31, 2012, the leverage on the portfolio of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds calculated to a ratio of 53% of the par value of the portfolio.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P15_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P15_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P16_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by multifamily properties that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P16_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required which, if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle the Partnership to receive payment of contingent interest on its bond investment.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P16_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P16_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other tax-exempt investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P16_S4	We may also be able to use a higher-quality investment portfolio to obtain higher leverage to be used to acquire additional investments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P17_S0	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, but may also consider bonds issued to finance student housing projects and housing for senior citizens.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P17_S1	The four basic types of multifamily housing revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM1_P18_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P18_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable apartment project financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P18_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the apartment project may be rented at market rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P19_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the apartment project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_13_ITEM1_P19_S1	Multifamily housing bonds that were issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P20_S0	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed apartment project.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P20_S1	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P20_S2	We expect to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P20_S3	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P21_S0	The Partnership invests in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on multifamily apartment projects.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P21_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P21_S2	Five of the 22 bonds currently owned by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying apartment properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P21_S3	As a result, the amount of interest earned by the Partnership from its investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the properties collateralizing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P22_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P23_S0	The Partnership may invest in other types of tax-exempt securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P23_S1	These tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P24_S0	Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates .
1059142_13_ITEM1_P24_S1	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P24_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P24_S3	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P25_S0	The PHC Certificates most recent rating by Standard Poor's is investment grade.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Company also invests in state-issued MBS that are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P26_S1	These MBS are rated investment grade by Standard Poor's or Moody's as of December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable mortgage loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are held by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S0	While the Partnership generally does not seek to acquire equity interests in real property as long-term or permanent investments, it may acquire real estate securing its revenue bonds or taxable mortgage loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S1	In addition, as part of its growth strategy, the Partnership may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to position itself for a future investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such apartment complexes by a new owner.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new tax-exempt bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S3	The Partnership may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S4	After the LIHTC compliance period, the Partnership would expect to sell its interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek tax-exempt bond financing on the MF Property which the Partnership could acquire.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S5	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the acquisition by the Partnership of an interest in an MF Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P28_S6	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P29_S0	There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily housing in the United States.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P29_S1	The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) reports that there are approximately 7.1 million American households in need of quality affordable housing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P29_S2	The types of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P29_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the income paid on these bonds is exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P30_S0	The National Council of State Housing Agencies Fact Sheet and HUD have captured some key scale metrics and opportunities of this market:
1059142_13_ITEM1_P31_S0	The availability of tax-exempt bond financing for affordable multifamily housing to be owned by private, for-profit developers in each state in each calendar year is limited by the statewide volume cap distributed as described in Section 146 of the Internal Revenue Code; this private activity bond financing is based on state population and indexed to inflation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P32_S0	The supply of rental units is expected to fall short of demand with apartment vacancies continuing to decline.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P33_S0	In addition to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P33_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with tax-exempt bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P33_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P33_S3	The Partnership does not invest in LIHTCs, but is attracted to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and; therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P34_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P34_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P34_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P35_S0	The 2008 Housing Act simplified and expanded the use of LIHTCs and tax-exempt bond financing for low-income multifamily housing industry.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P35_S1	Additionally, it exempted newly issued tax-exempt private activity bonds from Alternative Minimum Tax.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P35_S2	Previously, these tax-exempt private activity bonds were Alternative Minimum Tax preference items for individual taxpayers.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P35_S3	We believe these changes should enhance the Partnership's opportunities for making investments in accordance with its investment criteria.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P36_S0	Current credit market conditions have shown some improvement over the last year which has offered more opportunities for tax- exempt bond financing and a commensurate improvement in LIHTC syndication which often accompanies these transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P36_S1	The Partnership is currently seeing opportunity in new origination as well as secondary market transactions for tax-exempt multifamily housing investment given these improved market conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting availability of debt financing has improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has increased, overall availability remains limited and the cost of credit may continue to be adversely impacted.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S3	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S4	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P37_S5	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P38_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P38_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt, together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company, can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P38_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt, and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional tax-exempt housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, the economic conditions including higher levels of unemployment, lack of job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S5	While some properties have been negatively effected, our overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 86% during 2012 as compared to 85% during 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S6	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has remained the same at approximately 76% during 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM1_P39_S7	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability in 2013 and 2014 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will continue to be positive.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our operating policy is to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio is approximately $198.6 million which includes the tax-exempt bonds secured by the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property which are eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P41_S2	One TOB facility with DB and the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac which have an outstanding balance of $103.9 million in total are the outstanding debt financing arrangements that have securitized tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P41_S3	This calculates to a leverage ratio of 52%.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P41_S4	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 60% and 80% of the total par value of the Partnership's other tax-exempt investments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P42_S0	There are eight outstanding TOB facilities at December 31, 2012, which sum to outstanding borrowings of $74.1 million, which are securitizations of the PHC Certificates and MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P42_S1	The par value of the PHC Certificates and MBS is $96.9 million which calculates to a leverage ratio of 76%.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P42_S2	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $39.1 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P42_S3	These mortgage loans mature at various times from May 2013 through February 2017.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P42_S4	The debt financing plus mortgage loans total $217.1 million results in a leverage ratio to Partnership Total Assets of 51%.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S1	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S2	In May 2012, the Partnership issued an additional 12,650,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.06 per BUC pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-3.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $60.0 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $4.0 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S4	In April 2010, the Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to the Registration Statement.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P43_S6	There was no equity raise completed in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P44_S0	In May 2012, the outstanding GMF-Madison Tower Apartments and GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company were sold for an amount greater than the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Company received approximately $4.1 million for the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and approximately $12.7 million from the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond resulting in an approximate $668,000 realized gain.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P45_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 subordinate tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a subordinate $934,000 taxable bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P46_S0	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and is currently under construction.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P46_S1	Both bonds mature on February 1, 2053 and carry an annual cash interest rate of 9% plus allow for an additional 3% of interest calculated on the property's cash flows after debt service.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P46_S2	The Vantage at Judson apartments has a construction loan with an unrelated bank and the Partnership's bonds are second lien borrowings to that construction loan.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P46_S3	The property will have 288 units when construction is anticipated to be completed in the spring of 2014.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P47_S0	Under the terms of a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement, the Partnership has agreed to purchase a new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond of up to $26,687,000 ( Series B Bonds ) which will be delivered by the Issuer of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond once the property meets specific obligations and occupancy rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P47_S1	The Series B Bonds will have a stated interest rate of 6% and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the construction loan to the bank and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P48_S0	In June 2012, the Partnership acquired a $10.0 million restructured par value tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments, a 348 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance for approximately $10.2 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P48_S1	In December 2012, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments was restructured to an $11.5 million par value tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond with an annual interest rate of 6.25% and maturity of December 1, 2049.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P48_S2	The Partnership then purchased 100% of this bond issuance plus a taxable loan of approximately $191,000 for a payment of approximately $1,041,000 made at closing, net of refunding of the $10.0 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S0	In August 2012, the Company closed on the purchase of the Maples on 97 th property, a 258 unit facility located in Omaha, Nebraska, for a purchase price of approximately $5.5 million through the execution of a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement that assigned the right to acquire and own the Maples on 97 th property to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Title Company (EAT (Maples on 97th)), for a period not to exceed six months.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S1	During this six month hold period, the Company will rehabilitate the property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S2	The Company lent the EAT (Maples on 97th) the necessary funds to purchase the replacement property; there is no other capital within that entity.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S3	The EAT (Maples on 97th) then executed a Master Lease Agreement and Construction Management Agreement with the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S4	These two agreements give the Company the rights and obligations to manage the replacement property as well as the rehabilitation during the six month hold period.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P49_S5	In February 2013, ownership of Maples on 97 th property was transferred to the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P50_S0	In February 2013, the limited partner owners of the Ohio Properties contributed sufficient capital for a real estate sale to be recognized during the first quarter of 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P50_S1	As such, the Ohio Properties are reported as discontinued operations instead of MF Properties subject to a Sales Agreement in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P50_S2	The Company will recognize the deferred gain of approximately $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, report the tax-exempt mortgage bonds collateralized by the Ohio Properties as an asset, and report the related interest income on the bonds commencing with first quarter of 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P51_S0	In November 2012, the Partnership sold the Eagle Ridge property for approximately $2.5 million resulting in a gain of approximately $126,000.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P51_S1	This transaction resulted in the property being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods reported.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P52_S0	In October 2012, the limited partnership that owns the Greens Property admitted two entities that are affiliates of Boston Capital ( BC Partners ) as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Greens Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P52_S1	The Company acquired 100% of the $9.5 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Greens Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P52_S2	Under the sales agreement, the Greens Property was sold for a total purchase price of $7.3 million resulting in a gain of approximately $1.5 million which has been deferred by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P52_S3	The new limited partners are obligated to invest approximately $3.2 million of capital into the property, the majority of which is expected to be received prior to October 1, 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P52_S4	This transaction resulted in the property being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods reported.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P53_S0	In August 2012, the Partnership sold the Commons at Churchland property for approximately $8.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately $1.3 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P53_S1	This transaction resulted in the property being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods reported.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Partnership is managed by its general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 ) which is controlled by its general partner, the Burlington Capital Group LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_13_ITEM1_P54_S1	The persons acting as the Board of Managers and executive officers of Burlington act as the directors and executive officers of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P54_S2	Certain services are provided to the Partnership by other employees of Burlington and the Partnership reimburses Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P54_S3	The Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P55_S0	The Partnership competes with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership for the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P55_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S0	Because the Partnership holds tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured entirely by multifamily residential properties and holds an interest in the MF Properties, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other residential real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S2	Multifamily properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S3	To compete effectively, the apartment properties financed or owned by the Partnership must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Partnership's apartment properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P56_S5	These apartment properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Partnership believes that each of the MF Properties and the properties collateralizing its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P58_S0	The Partnership is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, it makes no provision for income taxes.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P58_S1	The distributive share of the Partnership's income, deductions and credits is included in each unitholder's income tax return.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Partnership holds its interests in MF Properties through various subsidiaries which are C corporations for income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P59_S1	These subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P59_S2	Therefore, the Partnership is only subject to income taxes on these investments to the extent it receives dividends from the subsidiaries.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P60_S0	The VIEs which are reported on a consolidated basis with the Partnership for GAAP reporting purposes are separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P60_S1	The Partnership does not presently believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP will impact the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to unitholders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P61_S0	All financial information in this Form 10-K presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, is that of the Partnership and the VIEs on a consolidated basis.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P61_S1	We refer to the Partnership, its wholly owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ), and the consolidated VIEs throughout this Form 10-K as the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P61_S2	We refer to the Partnership and Holding Company, without consolidation of the VIEs, as the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P62_S0	We are a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P62_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P63_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and multifamily real estate properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P64_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P65_S0	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P65_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P66_S0	In connection with the operation of the Partnership, AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments, and taxable mortgage loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P66_S1	Ten of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership provide for the payment of this administrative fee to the general partner by the owner of the financed property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P66_S2	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P66_S3	Our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P66_S4	In addition, our Agreement of Limited Partnership provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the general partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P67_S0	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P67_S1	Any mortgage placement fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P67_S2	The amount of mortgage placement fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2 and such property owners.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P68_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of apartment complexes.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P68_S1	Properties Management currently manages the seven MF Properties, seven of the properties whose tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are held by the Partnership, and four of the properties whose tax-exempt bonds are owned by the Partnership and are reported as discontinued operations.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P68_S2	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P68_S3	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of apartment complexes financed by additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P68_S4	If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P69_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P70_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_13_ITEM1_P71_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Partnership are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Cash distributions from the Partnership may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Partnership currently distributes cash to unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P2_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.33 per unit.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Although the Partnership may supplement its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless the Partnership is able to increase its cash receipts through completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to maintain its current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if the Partnership completes its current investment plans.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying multifamily properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying apartment complex.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, except in limited cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes our investments in these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other apartment complexes, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our bonds are located, there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The principal of most of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Similarly, if a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying multifamily property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will suffer a loss.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In the event a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The taxable mortgage loans that we make to owners of the apartment properties that secure tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable loans than on the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these taxable loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, the Partnership does not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable mortgage loan if the property is not in default on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future tax-exempt bond financings of these projects.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We expect to ultimately sell these MF Properties to unaffiliated parties often as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P16_S2	Our plan is to provide tax-exempt mortgage financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For this and other reasons, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to sell its interests in the MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the value of the Partnership's interest in MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, there is no assurance the Partnership will not incur a loss upon the sale of its interest in an MF Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P17_S5	During the time the Partnership owns an interest in an MF Property, any net income it receives from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any future issuances of additional units could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Partnership may issue additional units from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing units and a decrease in the market price of the units.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with a specific interest rate indices.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P21_S2	All of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to unitholders and may affect the market value of our units.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P23_S0	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A decrease in the value of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P23_S2	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds through the issuance of additional units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, to mitigate the risks we are exposed to as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S1	However, there is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and there is no assurance these costs will not ultimately turn out to exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There is also a risk that a counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This can result in significant period to period volatility in the Partnership's reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and Mortgage-backed securities.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our tax-exempt assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable rate.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As the holder of the residual interest, the Partnership is entitled to any remaining tax-exempt interest received by the trust holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents and liquidity providers.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following:
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on a specified index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying tax-exempt interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less tax-exempt interest available to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P30_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the Partnership's return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and no party guarantees the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Partnership holds a residual interest (known as Class B interests in a TEBS financing facility and a LIFER in a TOB financing facility) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, none of the tax-exempt interest received by such a trust will be paid to the Partnership as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, the Partnership can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P32_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause the Partnership to lose the tax-exempt assets and other collateral it pledged for such financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then the Partnership will be required, through its guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P34_S5	As a result, the Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose its investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair the Partnership's ability to recover the tax-exempt assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In that situation, it is possible that the Partnership would not be able to recover the tax-exempt assets it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by the Partnership in such trust or other entity.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth combined with continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, restricted availability of credit, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to a slow economic recovery and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, to provide funding to borrowers.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P39_S1	As a result, our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P39_S2	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The majority of our assets consist of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S2	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S5	As a result, our ability to sell our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P41_S6	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P42_S0	The Company has acquired interests (known as "LIFERS") in three PHC TOB Trusts, which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P42_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P42_S2	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P42_S3	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P42_S4	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by the Company from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P43_S0	The Company's investment in PHC Certificates and MBS are made pursuant to the provision of its Agreement of Limited Partnership that allows investment in tax-exempt securities that are not mortgage revenue bonds backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative tax-exempt securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P43_S1	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust or any of the MBS was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee over the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P43_S2	Accordingly, the Partnership would be required to liquidate its LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P44_S1	Likewise, if the Partnership liquidates the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates or mortgage-backed securities will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P44_S2	As a result, there can be no assurance that the Partnership will be able to divest its position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the Company's mortgage-backed securities may materially adversely affect our profitability or result in liquidity shortfalls that could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company's MBS are secured by pools of mortgages on residential properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P46_S1	In general, the mortgages collateralizing our MBS may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P47_S0	Prepayments on our MBS result when homeowners/mortgagees satisfy (i.e., pay off) the mortgage upon selling or refinancing their mortgaged property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P47_S1	When we acquire a particular MBS, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate which, together with expected coupon income, provides us with an expected yield on such MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P47_S2	If we purchase assets at a premium to par value, and borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will have to amortize the related premium on an accelerated basis.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P47_S3	Conversely, if we purchase assets at a discount to par value, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Prepayment rates on loans are influenced by changes in mortgage and market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P49_S0	In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P49_S1	If general interest rates decline at the same time, the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid (to the extent such assets are available for us to reinvest in).
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P51_S0	All of the apartment properties securing our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P51_S1	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P51_S2	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P51_S3	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P51_S4	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner's ability to service its debt.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The properties financed by certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Five of the multifamily housing properties financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are located in areas that are prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P53_S1	The current insurable value of these five properties is approximately $84.6 million.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property's value.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P54_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the five properties financed by the Partnership that are located in areas rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a 5% deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result, if any of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property and this could result in a default on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P54_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P54_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P55_S0	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P57_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P58_S0	If we acquire ownership of apartment properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P59_S0	We may acquire ownership of apartment complexes financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P59_S1	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these apartment properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In either case, during the time we own an apartment complex, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P59_S3	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates and increases in operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P59_S4	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership's financial results and ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P60_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of multifamily apartment properties that may affect the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We may invest in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P62_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P62_S2	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P62_S3	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the tax-exempt bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable loan.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S3	Any return on this additional investment would not be tax-exempt.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive tax-exempt interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P63_S5	The overall return to the Partnership from its investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P64_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P65_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P65_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P65_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P66_S0	We have assumed certain potential liability relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The Partnership has acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P67_S1	When the Partnership acquires an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after the Partnership acquired its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P67_S2	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The Partnership is not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The Partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because it operates under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P70_S0	The Partnership engages in transactions with related parties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as the General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for many of the multifamily apartment properties that underlie our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own three of the apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Partnership and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S4	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S5	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm's length.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P71_S6	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, or MBS is determined to be taxable.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Certain of our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P73_S3	If the IRS were to determine that tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P74_S0	We have obtained legal opinions to the effect that the base interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes provided the interest is not paid to a substantial user or related person as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P74_S1	However, these legal opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurances can be given that the conclusions reached will not be contested by the IRS or, if contested, will be sustained by a court.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P74_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt status of the interest paid on our tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is subject to compliance by the underlying properties, and the owners thereof, with the bond documents and covenants required by the bond-issuing authority and the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P74_S3	Among these requirements are tenant income restrictions, regulatory agreement compliance, reporting requirements, use of proceeds restrictions and compliance with rules pertaining to interest arbitrage.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Each issuer of the revenue bonds, as well as each of the underlying property owners/borrowers, has agreed to comply with procedures and guidelines designed to ensure satisfaction with the continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Failure to comply with these continuing requirements of the Internal Revenue Code may cause the interest on our bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactively to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P75_S2	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS into trusts and are entitled to a share of the tax-exempt interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interests on senior securities issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Not all of the income received by the Partnership is exempt from taxation.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P77_S0	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable mortgage loans to the owners of properties which are secured by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The interest income earned by the Partnership on these mortgage loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or a taxable loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P77_S3	In that case, the taxable income received by the Partnership will be allocated to our unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P78_S0	If the Partnership was determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for the Partnership and its unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The Partnership has made an election to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P79_S1	The purpose of this election is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for the Partnership and allow us to pass through our tax-exempt interest to our unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P79_S2	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P79_S3	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by the Partnership to unitholders being treated as taxable ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Partnership's earnings and profits, which would include tax-exempt income.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P79_S4	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The listing of the Partnership's units for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market causes the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends and certain other items.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Substantially all of the Partnership's gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S4	In such a case, if more than 10% of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, the Partnership will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P81_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P82_S0	To the extent the Partnership generates taxable income; unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P83_S0	As a partnership, our unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by the Partnership, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P84_S0	There are limits on the ability of our unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_13_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The ability of unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by the Partnership will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is collateralized by a multifamily housing property.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P1_S0	As a result of the guidance on consolidations, the Company is required to consolidate certain of the multifamily residential properties securing its bonds because the owners of those properties are treated as Consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P1_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company consolidated four multifamily housing properties owned by VIEs located in Florida, Nebraska and South Carolina.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P1_S2	The Partnership does not hold title to the properties owned by the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P1_S3	Due to a Master Lease Agreement executed between the Partnership and the owner of the Maples on 97th property, the results from operations of that property are included in the MF Properties footnote and in the consolidated statement of operations.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P2_S0	In addition to the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs, the Company reports the financial results of the MF Properties on a consolidated basis due to the limited partnership interests held by its subsidiary in the partnerships that own the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P2_S1	The Company consolidated eleven MF Properties located in Nebraska, Kentucky, Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, and Ohio as of December 31, 2012 .
1059142_13_ITEM2_P2_S2	The three Ohio Properties and the Greens Property in North Carolina are reported as discontinued operations (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM2_P3_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for each of the consolidated properties as of December 31, 2012 :
1059142_13_ITEM2_P4_S0	(1) Due to a Master Lease Agreement between the Partnership and the EAT, the results from operations of the Maples on 97th property are included in the MF Properties segment.
1059142_13_ITEM2_P4_S1	(2) The construction work in process represents pre-development architecture and engineering costs related to a 475 bed student housing project to be built above a 1,605 parking stall garage to be constructed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
1059142_13_ITEM3_P0_S0	There are no pending legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the properties collateralizing the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are subject.
1059142_13_ITEM5_P0_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_13_ITEM5_P0_S1	The rights and obligations of unitholders are set forth in the Partnership's Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM5_P1_S0	BUCs of the Partnership trade on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol "ATAX".
1059142_13_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the BUCs for each quarterly period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012 .
1059142_13_ITEM5_P2_S0	The approximate number of unitholders on December 31, 2012 was 11,778.
1059142_13_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distributions to unitholders were made on a quarterly basis during 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 .
1059142_13_ITEM5_P3_S1	Total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 were approximately $20,643,000, $15,061,000, and $13,574,000, respectively.

1059142_13_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in response to Item 8 of this report.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P0_S2	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and it's effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K:
1059142_13_ITEM6_P1_S0	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and it's effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K (continued):
1059142_13_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, Tier 2 income due to the general partner (as defined in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative income or expense (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on assets, deferred gain and related interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to consolidated VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company uses CAD as a supplemental measurement of its ability to pay distributions.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P4_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P4_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership's operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P4_S2	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P4_S3	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P5_S0	The following sets forth a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and the Partnership's CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S2	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax exempt revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Tier 2 income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S4	For the second quarter of 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier 2 income.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S5	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove, and contingent interest received from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM6_P6_S6	For 2008, Lake Forest generated approximately $45,000, Fairmont Oaks generated approximately $54,000, and Iona Lakes generated approximately $54,000 of Tier 2 income.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Partnership refers to America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries which consist of:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac (See Notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P2_S0	Seven multifamily apartments ("MF Properties") of which six are owned by various Partnership subsidiaries.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P2_S1	Such subsidiaries hold a 99% limited partner interest in three limited partnerships and 100% member positions in four limited liability companies.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P2_S2	The seventh MF Property is Maples on 97th whose operating results are reported by the Partnership as a result of a Master Lease Agreement between the Partnership and the owner of that property (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P3_S0	Four apartment properties are reported as discontinued operations (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P4_S0	The Company refers to the consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K which include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Partnership, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and three other consolidated entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary ( Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P4_S1	All significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S0	On December 31, 2012 , the Partnership owned 22 federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $198.6 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 20 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 3,880 rental units located in the states of Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S3	Each bond is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S4	The properties underlying the fourteen non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 2,700 rental units at December 31, 2012 .
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S5	Two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units and two bonds secured by the Greens Property containing 168 rental units are eliminated in consolidation in the Company's financial statement (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and the multifamily apartment properties are reported as discontinued operations.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P5_S6	As of December 31, 2011 , the properties underlying the fifteen non-consolidated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 2,947 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P6_S0	The tax-exempt bond segment reported revenue of approximately $12.2 million, interest expense of approximately $3.5 million and income from continuing operations of approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P6_S1	The tax-exempt bond investments segment reported revenue of approximately $12.6 million and $11.1 million, interest expense of approximately $4.5 million and $1.8 million and loss from continuing operations of approximately $0.4 million versus income from continuing operations of approximately $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P6_S2	The majority of the increase in income from continuing operations between 2011 to 2012 resulted from a $4.2 million impairment of the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011 and no taxable loan impairments in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P6_S3	The remaining reason for the increase is due to the non-cash change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives; which was a loss of $2.1 million and approximately $945,000 in 2011 and 2012, respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P6_S4	The approximately $2.7 million change in income from operations between 2011 versus 2010 can also be attributed to the $4.2 million impairment of the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011 versus an approximately $560,000 impairment of the Woodland Park and Ashley Square/Cross Creek cross-collateralized loans offset by the additional $1.5 million of revenue attributed to additional bonds purchased in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P7_S0	The three Consolidated VIE multifamily apartment properties as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, contained a total of 650 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P8_S0	During 2012, the Company invested in other types of tax-exempt securities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P8_S1	In accordance with the terms of the Agreement of Limited Partners, these tax-exempt securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P9_S0	Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts' Certificates ("PHC Certificates") .
1059142_13_ITEM7_P9_S1	The PHC Certificates, acquired during 2012, consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P9_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P9_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Company owns PHC Certificates with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $65.3 million.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P11_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, the Partnership may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties, in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through a sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P11_S1	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P11_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P11_S3	The Partnership expects to provide the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 504 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S1	In addition, the Partnership's subsidiaries own four MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village and Weatherford containing a total of 842 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S2	The MF Properties' operating goal is similar to that of the properties underlying the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S3	As of December 31, 2011, the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in five entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 602 rental units which includes the Greens of Pine property, Eagle Ridge, and Commons atof which six Churchland property which were all legally sold in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S4	Also as of December 31, 2011, the Partnership's subsidiaries own four MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village and Weatherford.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P12_S5	Arboretum, Eagle Village and DeCordova contain a total of 732 rental units and the construction of 76 units was in process at Weatherford as of December 31, 2011 (see Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P13_S0	The MF Properties segment reported revenue of approximately $7.8 million and $5.1 million and a loss from continuing operations of approximately $1.1 million and $783,000 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P13_S1	The increase in revenue is due to having a full years worth of revenue from the Arboretum and Eagle Village properties which were acquired during 2011 and the Maples on 97th property which was acquired in August 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P13_S2	This increase in revenue was more than offset by an increase in real estate operating expenses and depreciation expense also attributed to these acquired properties as well as real estate operating expenses and depreciation expense from the Weatherford property which finalized construction during the first half of 2012 and is in lease-up at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P14_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units and the Greens Property containing 168 rental units which are reported as discontinued operations (see Note 2 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).

1059142_13_ITEM7_P14_S2	The increase in income between 2011 and 2012 can be attributed to the $1.4 million gain realized from the sales of the Commons at Churchland and Eagle Ridge properties in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P14_S3	The change from loss to income from 2010 to 2011 can be attributed to the one-time payment in 2010 of AFCA 2 fees by the Ohio Properties and other costs related to the sale of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P15_S0	During 2012, the Company closed on eight new TOB Trusts all issued under the terms of the Company's Master Trust Agreement with DB.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting availability of debt financing has improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S1	While economic trends show signs of a stabilization of the economy and debt availability has increased, overall availability remains limited and the cost of credit may continue to be adversely impacted.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S2	These conditions, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S3	We believe this continues to create opportunities to acquire existing tax-exempt bonds from distressed holders at attractive yields.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S4	The Partnership continues to evaluate potential investments in bonds which are available on the secondary market.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P19_S5	We believe many of these bonds will meet our investment criteria and that we have a unique ability to analyze and close on these opportunities while maintaining our ability and willingness to also participate in primary market transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P20_S0	Current credit and real estate market conditions also create opportunities to acquire quality MF Properties from distressed owners and lenders.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P20_S1	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P20_S2	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our unitholders in the form of a strong tax-exempt bond investment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S0	On the other hand, continued economic weakness in some markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S1	In addition, the economic conditions including a slow job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our tax-exempt bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S2	While some properties have been negatively effected, overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 86% during 2012 as compared to 85% during 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S3	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has remained the same at approximately 76% during 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S4	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P21_S5	We expect that property operations will improve in 2013 and that rental rate and occupancy trends will be continue to be positive.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P77_S1	Offsetting these increases was an approximate $1.1 million reduction in revenue due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes (which occurred in June 2011).

1059142_13_ITEM7_P80_S1	The decrease in other interest income is attributable to lower levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P81_S0	Approximately $555,000 reported in 2012 is the payment on a property owner promissory note received upon the restructuring of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P82_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P82_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P83_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P83_S1	The Arboretum and Eagle Village properties reported approximately $507,000 of expenses which were not included in 2011, Weatherford reported approximately $328,000 of expenses as an MF Property for 2012 as it began lease-up in late March 2012, and DeCordova reported an additional approximate $129,000 due to the beginning lease-up of its 34 new units in third quarter 2012.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P83_S4	These increases in expenses were offset by approximately $678,000 reduction in operating expenses due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P84_S0	During 2012, two interest payments from the Woodland Park bond were received and the remaining accrued interest of approximately $452,700 has been reserved.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P85_S1	No such provisions for loan losses were recorded against taxable loans during 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P86_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P86_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from the 2011 to 2012 is related to approximately $1.3 million from the Arboretum property (acquired on March 31, 2011), the Eagle Village property acquired at the end of June 2011, the additional depreciation recorded once the Weatherford and DeCordova's construction was completed and placed in service in second and third quarter 2012, and the acquisition of Maples on 97th acquired in third quarter of 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P86_S2	Offsetting this increase is the approximate $317,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes in second quarter 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P87_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2012 compared to 2011 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P87_S1	The Company's borrowing cost remained at approximately 2.7% per annum for both 2011 and 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P87_S2	However, the Company realized approximately $1.2 million increase in interest expense as a result of the higher average principal of outstanding debt in 2012 as compared to 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P87_S3	Offsetting this increase was the approximate $1.1 million decrease from the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P87_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P88_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to incentive compensation, increases in administrative fees due to the purchase of PHC Certificates and MBS and increases in professional fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P89_S0	Property revenues increased mainly as a result of additional MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P89_S1	The Arboretum was acquired on March 31, 2011, and added approximately $1.8 million to property revenues during 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S0	Eagle Village was acquired on June 29, 2011 and added approximately $945,000 to property revenues in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S1	Partially offsetting this increase was an approximately $1.4 million decrease in revenue due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S2	The remaining increase is primarily attributable to the increased economic occupancy at the existing MF Properties year over year.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S3	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties decreased to $4,974 per unit in 2011 from $6,369 in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S4	This was due to the acqusition of the Eagle Village student housing project which was acquired in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P90_S5	The annual net rental revenues per unit related to the Consolidated VIEs increased to approximately $6,973 in 2011 from approximately $6,888 in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P91_S0	Investment income increased during 2011 due to a higher level of bond investments.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P91_S4	In addition, the Company realized approximately $308,000 of contingent interest from the Clarkson College bond retirement in second quarter 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P92_S0	Gain on sale and retirements of bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P92_S1	Approximately $445,000 is the gain on the Briarwood tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement during 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P93_S0	Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P93_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P94_S0	Other income is comprised of two separate items.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P94_S1	Approximately $144,000 is related to the forgiveness of debt from an unrelated third party related to the DeCordova foreclosure which occurred in first quarter 2011 and the payment of a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P95_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P95_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P95_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000 in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P96_S0	Real estate operating expenses increased from approximately $6.1 million in 2010 to approximately $6.8 million in 2011 due to the following offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P96_S1	During 2011, real estate expenses increased approximately $1.2 million due to the addition of the Arboretum property, approximately $286,000 of which were acquisition related expenses, and approximately $667,000 due to the addition of the Eagle Village property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P96_S2	The deconsolidation of Iona Lakes reduced expenses by approximately $1.0 million when comparing 2011 to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P96_S3	In addition, the Ohio Property rehabilitation caused a reduction in real estate taxes, insurance and repairs and maintenance expenses year over year.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P97_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P98_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P98_S1	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $4.2 million was recorded against the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P98_S2	In 2010, approximately $212,000 was recorded against the Woodland Park taxable loan and $350,000 was recorded against the cross collateralized Ashley Square and Cross Creek taxable loans as an allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P99_S0	As a result of a decision by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs to terminate the anticipated Tax Credit Assistance Program funding for the Residences at Weatherford in October 2010, the Company determined that the property fixed assets and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on this project were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P99_S1	The resulting charge was attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P99_S2	In February 2011, the Company completed foreclosure proceedings on the bond issued on this property and now owns the property directly.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P99_S3	No impairment charges were recorded on this project in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P100_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the apartment properties of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P100_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 is related to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P100_S2	Approximately $742,000 of depreciation expense and approximately $163,000 of in-place lease amortization increases are directly related to the new MF Properties acquired in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P100_S3	This was offset by the reduction of approximately $446,000 depreciation expense due to the deconsolidation of Iona Lakes and the $197,000 reduction of amortization expense related to reduced deferred financing costs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P100_S4	The remaining increase is attributable to depreciation on newly capitalized and newly acquired assets.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P101_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2011 compared to 2010 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P101_S1	The Company's borrowing cost decreased from approximately 3.7% per annum in 2010 to approximately 2.7% resulting in an approximate decrease of $725,000 when comparing 2011 to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P101_S2	Offsetting this decrease was an approximate $1.5 million increase resulting from the higher average principal of outstanding debt.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P101_S3	The remaining approximate $2.7 million increase was the result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P101_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P102_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P102_S1	Approximately $179,000 of this increase is due to administration fees paid to AFCA2 as a result of new investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P102_S2	The remaining increase is related to increased salary and insurance expenses offset by a reduction in professional fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P103_S0	The following discussion of the Partnership's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 reflects the operations of the Partnership without the consolidation of the Consolidated VIEs required by the accounting guidance on consolidations.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P103_S1	The Ohio Properties and the Green property are reflected as discontinued operations and not Tax-Exempt Bond Investments in the following discussion.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P104_S0	This information reflects the information used by management to analyze the Partnership's operations and is reflective of the consolidated operations of the Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment, the MF Properties segment, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts segment, and the Mortgage-backed Securities segment as presented in Note 20 to the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P105_S0	Property revenues increased approximately $2.7 million from the addition of Eagle Village and Arboretum which was acquired after the first quarter 2011, DeCordova and Weatherford which began leasing in 2012, and Maples on 97th which was acquired in third quarter 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P105_S1	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties increased to $5,705 per unit in 2012 from $4,974 in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P106_S0	Investment income increased during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P106_S1	The increases are due to the additional tax-exempt interest payments of approximately $2.3 million from the the PHC Certificates, the Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, MBS, and the Vantage at Judson tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond acquired in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P106_S2	Offsetting these increases was an approximate $659,000 decrease attributable to the redemptions of Briarwood Manor Apartments and Clarkson College tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and approximately $230,000 due to the foreclosure of Weatherford in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P107_S0	Gain on sale and retirements of bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P107_S1	Approximately $668,000 of the gain on sale and retirements of bonds is the result of the sale of the GMF-Madison Tower and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds in May 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P107_S2	Approximately $445,000 on the gain on sale and retirements of bonds is the result of the gain on the Briarwood tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P108_S0	Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P108_S1	The decrease in other interest income is attributable to lower levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P109_S0	The $557,300 reported in 2012 is the payment on a property owner promissory note received upon the restructuring of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P109_S1	Other income in 2011 is comprised mostly of the forgiveness of third party debt related to the DeCordova foreclosure and a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing in third quarter 2011 which was not repeated in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P110_S0	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties is comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P110_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P110_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P111_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P111_S1	The Arboretum and Eagle Village properties reported approximately $507,000 of expenses which were not included in 2011, Weatherford reported approximately $328,000 of expenses as an MF Property for 2012 as it began lease-up in late March 2012, and DeCordova reported an additional approximate $129,000 due to the beginning lease-up of its 34 new units in third quarter 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P111_S2	In addition, Maples on 97th Apartments reported approximately $243,000 of acquisition and operating expenses as it was acquired in third quarter 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P111_S3	The remaining increases were related to the existing MF Properties normal operating expense increases in salaries, utilities, insurance and repair and maintenance.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P112_S0	During 2012, two interest payments from the Woodland Park bond were received and the remaining accrued interest of approximately $452,700 has been reserved.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P112_S1	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P113_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P113_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from the 2011 to 2012 is related to approximately $1.1 million from the Arboretum property (acquired on March 31, 2011), the Eagle Village property acquired at the end of June 2011, the additional depreciation recorded once the Weatherford and DeCordova's construction was completed and placed in service in second and third quarters of 2012, and the acquisition of Maples on 97th acquired in third quarter of 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P114_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2012 compared to 2011 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P114_S1	The Company's borrowing cost remained at approximately 2.7% per annum for both 2011 and 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P114_S2	However, the Company realized approximately $1.2 million increase in interest expense as a result of the higher average principal of outstanding debt in 2012 as compared to 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P114_S3	Offsetting this increase was the approximate $1.1 million decrease from the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P114_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P115_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to incentive compensation, increases in administrative fees due to the increased bond portfolio and increases in professional fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S0	Property revenues increased mainly as a result of additional MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S1	The Arboretum was acquired on March 31, 2011, Eagle Village was acquired on June 29, 2011, and DeCordova became an MF Property in the first quarter of 2011.

1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S3	Arboretum added approximately $1.8 million, Eagle Village added approximately $945,000, and DeCordova added approximately $607,000 to property revenues in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S4	In addition, the MF Properties that have been in the portfolio since the beginning of 2011 reported higher economic occupancy which contributed approximately $388,000 of additional revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S5	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties decreased to $4,974 per unit in 2011 from $6,369 in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P116_S6	This was due to the acqusition of the Eagle Village student housing project which was acquired in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P117_S0	Investment income increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due to a higher level of bond investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P117_S1	Total bond investments at December 31, 2011 were approximately $159.4 million as compared to approximately $143.4 million at December 31, 2010 for the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P117_S2	Interest payments of approximately $1.9 million were received from tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that the Company did not hold during 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P117_S3	In addition, the Company realized approximately $308,000 of contingent interest from the Clarkson College bond retirement in second quarter 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P117_S4	These increases were offset by less interest earned due to bond restructuring required to execute the TEBS financing facility and the Clarkson bond retirement.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P118_S0	Gain on sale and retirements of bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P118_S1	Approximately $445,000 is the gain on the Briarwood tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement during 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P119_S0	Other income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable loans held by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P119_S1	The increase in other interest income is attributable to higher levels of taxable loans outstanding in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P120_S0	Other income for 2011 includes the payment of a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P120_S1	No such amounts occurred during 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P121_S0	Gain on early extinguishment of debt.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P121_S1	In June 2010, the Company had the opportunity to acquire at a discount, and thereby retire, the $12.8 million outstanding mortgage debt secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P121_S2	The early extinguishment of this debt resulted in a gain of approximately $435,000 in the 2010 and did not repeat in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P122_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was related to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P122_S1	DeCordova was reported by the Partnership as a bond investment during the ten months in 2010, but was reported as an MF Property during 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P122_S2	This reporting change combined with the addition of Arboretum and Eagle Village in 2011 contributed to a net increase of approximately $1.9 million in real estate expenses in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P122_S3	Arboretum also added approximately $286,000 of acquisition fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P123_S0	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P124_S0	During 2011 and 2010, the Company determined that a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and an additional allowance for bad debt should be recorded.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P124_S1	An allowance for bad debt and an associated provision for loan loss of approximately $4.2 million was recorded against the Iona Lakes taxable loan in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P124_S2	In 2010 an allowance for loan loss of approximately $1.1 million was recorded against taxable loans.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P125_S0	As a result of a decision by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs to terminate the anticipated Tax Credit Assistance Program funding for the Residences at Weatherford in October 2010, the Company determined that the property fixed assets and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond on this project were impaired and recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P125_S1	The resulting charge was attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P125_S2	In February 2011, the Company completed foreclosure proceedings on the bond issued on this property and now owns the property directly.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P125_S3	No impairment charges were recorded on this project in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P126_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P126_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from 2010 to 2011 is related to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P126_S2	Approximately $934,000 of depreciation expense and approximately $163,000 of in-place lease amortization increases are directly related to the new MF Properties acquired in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P126_S3	This was offset by the reduction of approximately $197,000 in amortization expense related to reduced deferred financing costs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P126_S4	The remaining increase is attributable to depreciation on newly capitalized and newly acquired assets.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P127_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2011 compared to 2010 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P127_S1	The Company's borrowing cost decreased from approximately 3.7% per annum in 2010 to approximately 2.7% resulting in an approximate decrease of $725,000 when comparing 2011 to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P127_S2	Offsetting this decrease was an approximate $1.5 million increase resulting from the higher average principal of outstanding debt.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P127_S3	The remaining approximate $2.7 million increase was the result of the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P127_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P128_S0	General and administrative expenses increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P128_S1	Approximately $179,000 of this increase is due to administration fees paid to AFCA2 as a result of new investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P128_S2	The remaining increase is related to increased salary and insurance expenses offset by a reduction in professional fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S0	Primary sources and uses of funds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S1	Tax-exempt interest earned on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, including those financing properties held by Consolidated VIEs, represents the Partnership's principal source of cash flow.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S2	The Partnership also earns tax-exempt interest from its PHC Certificates, and MBS and may also receive cash distributions from equity interests held in MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S3	Tax-exempt interest is primarily comprised of base interest payments received on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S4	Certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds may also generate payments of contingent interest to the Partnership from time to time when the underlying apartment properties generate excess cash flow.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S5	Because base interest on each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and MBS is fixed, the Partnership's cash receipts tend to be fairly constant period to period unless the Partnership acquires or disposes of its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P129_S6	Changes in the economic performance of the properties financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds with a contingent interest provision will affect the amount of contingent interest, if any, paid to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P130_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by their real estate investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P131_S0	The economic performance of a multifamily apartment property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P131_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P131_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P131_S3	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P132_S0	The primary uses of cash by apartment properties are the payment of operating expenses and debt service.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P133_S0	Other sources of cash available to the Partnership include debt financing, mortgages, and the sale of additional BUCs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P133_S1	The Company currently has outstanding debt financing of $177.9 million under eight separate credit facilities and mortgages of $39.1 million secured by five MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S0	The Partnership's principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to unitholders, interest and principal on debt financing and general and administrative expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S1	The Partnership also uses cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S2	Distributions to unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S3	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by the Partnership from its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of the Partnership's outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by the Partnership on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by the Partnership and the number of units outstanding.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2012 , the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.33 per unit.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S5	See Cash Available for Distribution, on a following page within item 7.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S6	As a result, the Partnership was required to supplement its cash available for distribution during 2012, with unrestricted cash and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current investment plans.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S7	The General Partner believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able meet its liquidity requirements, including the payment of expenses, interest on its debt financing, and cash distributions to unitholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of unrestricted cash.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P134_S8	However, if actual results vary from current projections and the actual CAD generated is less than the new regular distribution, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P135_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary uses of cash are: (i) the payment of operating expenses; and (ii) the payment of debt service.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S0	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage bond portfolio.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio is approximately $198.6 million which includes the tax-exempt bonds secured by the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property which are eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S2	The outstanding debt financing arrangements are one TOB facility with Deutsche Bank and the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac which have an outstanding balance of $103.9 million in total.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S3	This calculates to a leverage ratio of 52%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S4	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 60% and 80% of the total par value of the Partnership's other tax-exempt investments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S5	The Partnership also has eight outstanding TOB facilities at December 31, 2012, which have total outstanding borrowings of $74.1 million which are securitizations of its PHC Certificates and MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S6	The par value of its PHC Certificates and MBS is $96.9 million which calculates to a leverage ratio of 76%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S7	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $39.1 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S8	These mortgage loans mature at various times from May 2013 through February 2017 (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P136_S9	The debt financing plus mortgage loans total $217.1 million results in a leverage ratio to Partnership Total Assets of 51%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S1	The gross proceeds from TEBS Financing were approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S3	The Company applied approximately $49.5 million of these net proceeds to repay the entire outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, its secured term loan from Bank of America.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S4	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P137_S5	Under the TEBS Financing, the Company transferred the 13 bonds, which have a total outstanding principal amount of approximately $123.6 million at December 31, 2012, to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Company (the Sponsor ).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S0	The securitization of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds was executed through the issuance of two classes of Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S3	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain Facility Fees.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S4	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.25% and the total Facility Fees were 1.9%, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 2.15%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S5	As of December 31, 2012 , the SIFMA rate was equal to .13% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.03% on the approximate $94.0 million outstanding balance.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P138_S6	As of December 31, 2011 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.15% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.05% on the approximate $94.9 million outstanding balance.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates are made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S3	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S4	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P139_S5	The Company also entered into various subordination and intercreditor agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Company has subordinated its rights and remedies with respect to the taxable mortgage loans made by it to the owners of properties securing certain of the Bonds to the rights of Freddie Mac as the holder of the Bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P140_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the TEBS Financing is presented by the Company as a secured financing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P140_S1	The TEBS Financing offers several advantages over the Company's previous credit facilities which, over time, are expected to positively impact the generation of CAD.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P140_S2	These advantages include: a longer term thereby addressing the previous refinancing risks, better balance sheet leverage thereby providing additional funds for investment, and a lower initial cost of borrowing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P141_S0	In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with Duetsche Bank ("DB") which allows the Company to execute multiple TOB structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P141_S1	Under each TOB structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues senior floating-rate participation interests ("SPEARS"), and residual participation interests ("LIFERS").
1059142_13_ITEM7_P141_S2	These SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P141_S3	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P141_S4	Under each TOB structure, the asset is transferred to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P142_S0	The Master Trust Agreement with DB has covenants that the Company is required to maintain compliance, the most restrictive of which at December 31, 2012, is that cash available to distribute for the trailing twelve months must be at least two times trailing twelve month interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P142_S2	If the Company were to be out of compliance with any of these covenants, it would trigger a termination event of the financing facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P143_S0	In November and December 2012, the Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the trustee over five different MBS TOB Trusts for approximately $6.5 million which are securitizations of mortgage-backed securities with a par value of approximately $31.6 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P143_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the MBS TOB Trusts on the mortgage-backed securities after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P143_S2	The Company is reporting the MBS TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P143_S3	The MBS TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $25.1 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P143_S4	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts and some have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P144_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased the PHC Certificate LIFERS issued by the trustee over the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P144_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P144_S2	The Company is reporting the PHC TOB Trust on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P144_S3	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P144_S4	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S0	In July 2011, the Company closed a $10 million financing utilizing the TOB structure with the securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S1	In December 2011, the Company closed a second $7.8 million TOB financing structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S2	The SPEARS were credit-enhanced by DB and sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors and the gross proceeds from their sale were remitted to the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S3	The LIFERS were retained by the Company and are pledged to DB to secure certain reimbursement obligations.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S4	In May 2012, the Company retired the $7.8 million TOB financing structure when the GMF-Warren/Tulane and GMF-Madison Tower tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were sold.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P145_S5	At December 31, 2012, the Company owed $9.8 million on the Autumn Pines TOB financing facility and at December 31, 2011, the Company owed $17.7 million on both TOB facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P146_S0	As a result, the TOB trusts essentially provide the Company with a secured variable rate debt facility at interest rates that reflect the prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates paid by the TOB trusts on the SPEARS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P146_S1	Payments made to the holders of the SPEARS and the amount of trust fees essentially represent the Company's effective cost of borrowing on the net proceeds it received from the sale of the SPEARS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P146_S2	The holders of the SPEARS are entitled to receive regular payments from the TOB trusts at a variable rate established by a third party remarketing firm that is expected to be similar to the weekly SIFMA floating index rate.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P146_S3	Payments on the SPEARS will be made prior to any payments on the LIFERS held by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P146_S4	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P147_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts outstanding under each TOB Trust and the variable interest rate as of December 31, 2012:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S0	The Partnership is authorized to issue additional BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S1	In April 2010, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $200.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S2	In May 2012, the Partnership issued an additional 12,650,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.06 per BUC.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $60 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $4.0 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S4	In April 2010, the Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.37 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $41.6 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $2.8 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P148_S6	There was no equity raise completed in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S0	On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased approximately $2.7 million compared to the same period a year earlier mainly due to changes in working capital components.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S1	Cash used for investing activities increased approximately $65.5 million for 2012 as compared to 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S2	In 2012, the Company used approximately $145.8 million for the purchase of the PHC Trust Certificates, the purchase of the MBS, the purchase of Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, the purchase of the Vantage at Judson tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the purchase of the Maples on 97th property and property renovations, and to make taxable loans.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S3	The Company received cash from the sale of the GMF-Madison Tower and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the restructuring of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, the sale of a mortgage-backed security, the sale of the Churchland and the Eagle Ridge properties, and the net release of restricted cash of approximately $47.5 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S4	In 2011, approximately $32.6 million of cash was used for investing activities to acquire the Arboretum Apartments, Eagle Village Apartments and the Briarwood Manor, GMF-Madison, and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds offset by the release of restricted cash upon foreclosure of the DeCordova and Weatherford properties, the retirement of the Clarkson College bond, the repayment of a taxable loan by the Foundation for Affordable Housing, and the renovations of the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S5	The Company had approximately $71.4 million additional cash available from financing activities for 2012 as compared to 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S6	Financing cash flows in 2012 included approximately $60.0 million of cash from the equity raise in second quarter 2012 and approximately $55.6 million from the PHC and MBS TOB Trusts borrowings, offset by the use of cash to payoff the GMF Warren/Tulane TOB facility and the mortgages on the Churchland and Greens Property which were sold in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S7	In 2011, the Company had borrowings of $58.6 million and repaid approximately $14.9 million of short-term borrowings.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P149_S8	Cash distributions increased year over year due to the additional shares outstanding resulting from the May 2012 equity raise.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P150_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P150_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P150_S2	To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, certain income due to the General Partner (defined as Tier 2 income in the Agreement of Limited Partnership), interest rate derivative expense or income (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on bonds, losses related to Consolidated VIEs including the cumulative effect of accounting change, and depreciation and amortization expense are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P151_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P151_S1	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P152_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership restructured the Arbors of Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and received payment on the $600,000 promissory note less costs associated with the transaction and approximately $557,000 has been recorded as other income (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P152_S1	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P153_S0	In November 2012, the Partnership sold the Eagle Ridge property for approximately $2.5 million resulting in a gain of approximately $126,000.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P153_S1	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P153_S2	This transaction resulted in the property being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods reported (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P154_S0	In August 2012, the Partnership sold the Commons at Churchland property for approximately $8.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately $1.3 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P154_S1	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P154_S2	This transaction resulted in the property being reported as a discontinued operation for all periods reported (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P155_S0	In May 2012, the outstanding GMF-Madison Tower Apartments and GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company were sold for an amount greater than the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P155_S1	The Company received approximately $4.1 million for the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and approximately $12.7 million from the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond resulting in an approximate $668,000 realized gain.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P155_S2	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P156_S0	In October 2011, the Briarwood Manor bond was called and retired at par plus accured interest for approximately $4.9 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P156_S1	This transaction resulted in approximately $445,000 gain reported in the fourth quarter of 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P156_S2	This gain meets the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P157_S0	Upon redemption of the Clarkson College bond in May 2011, the Company realized approximately $308,000 in contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P157_S1	Contingent interest is Tier 2 income and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S0	During June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby three of the MF Properties, the Ohio Properties, were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity (see Note 3).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S1	In February 2013, the limited Partner owners of the Ohio Properties contributed sufficient capital for a real estate sale to be recognized during the first quarter of 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S2	As such, the Ohio Properties are reported as discontinued operations instead of MF Properties subject to a Sales Agreement in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S3	The Company will recognize the deferred gain of approximately $1.8 million in the consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of 2013, as well as report the tax-exempt mortgage bonds collateralized by the Ohio Properties as an asset and report the related interest income on the bonds commencing with first quarter of 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S4	As the deferred gain on the transaction represented cash paid to the Company and no on-going legal obligations related to the Ohio Properties or potential obligation to repay any amounts exists, the deferred gain was reported as CAD in 2010 and is shown as an adjustment in the CAD Calculation below.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P158_S5	This gain met the definition of Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) and was therefore distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Partnership has made annual cash distribution of $0.50 per unit since 2009.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S1	Since realized CAD per unit was less than $0.50 per unit, the Partnership paid approximately $5.8 million and $3.9 million of the distribution using unrestricted cash to supplement the deficit in 2012 and 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S2	The Partnership has historically supplemented its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash when necessary and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current plans to invest the net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of BUCs in May 2012 on a leveraged basis.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S3	The General Partner has identified a pipeline of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds it intends to acquire in 2013 and is actively performing due diligence on these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds to ensure they meet the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S4	The General Partner is also working with the Partnership's primary lender to finance a portion of the acquisition of these bonds and believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to unitholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S5	However, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be unable to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P159_S6	In that case, the annual distribution rate per unit may need to be reduced.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P160_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 .
1059142_13_ITEM7_P161_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P161_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P161_S2	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 Income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane tax exempt revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P161_S3	For the year ended 2011, the Tier 2 Income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P161_S4	For the second quarter of 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier 2 income.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P162_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Partnership held tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by multifamily housing projects.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P162_S1	The multifamily housing projects are owned by entities that are not controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P162_S2	The Partnership has no equity interest in these entities and does not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P162_S3	Some of the ownership entities are deemed to be Consolidated VIEs and are consolidated with the Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P162_S4	The VIEs that are consolidated with the Partnership do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P163_S0	The Partnership does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P163_S1	As such, the Partnership is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Partnership does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Partnership or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P165_S0	The Partnership has the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P166_S0	As discussed in Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2013 consist of the paydowns on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P166_S1	The Partnership plans to refinance the current maturing mortgages and TOB debt financing facilities in the first half of 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond ( Series C Bonds ) and a $934,000 taxable bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S1	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and is currently under construction.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S2	In connection with the purchase of these bonds, the Partnership also executed a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement with the borrower under the bonds, the issuer of the $6,049,000 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond ( Issuer ), and the Bank which is providing the remainder of the construction financing and has the first lien on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S3	Under the terms of this agreement and the Trust Indenture, the Issuer has agreed to fund up to $26,687,000 of senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds ( Series B Bonds ) to allow for the full refunding of the Bank's construction loan ( Series A Bonds ) and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 Series C Bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S4	The Partnership has an obligation to purchase the Series B Bonds upon the successful completion of specific conversion conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S5	These conversion conditions include no material default by borrower under the trust indenture, the completion of the survey of the property and title insurance, and occupancy of 90% for 90 days at the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S6	The amount of the Series B Bonds will be no less than $20,638,000 and the final amount will depend on the Reallocation Calculation which is defined as 80% bond to appraised property value and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.0.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P167_S7	The Partnership expects to purchase the Series B bonds in 2014 but if the conversion conditions are not met by January 1, 2015, the Partnership has the ability to terminate the Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_13_ITEM7_P168_S0	With respect to the financial results of the Partnership's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the multifamily residential properties, which collateralize the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P168_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P168_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P168_S3	Inflation did not have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P169_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P169_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P170_S0	All of the Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P170_S1	The Company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies because they involve judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P170_S2	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P171_S0	Accounting for the TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements The Company evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P171_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P171_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P172_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P172_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P172_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P173_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P173_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P173_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P173_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to derecognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P173_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the tax-exempt assets held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the LIFERS so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P174_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of the consolidation guidance.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P174_S1	As part of the TEBS Financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P174_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P174_S3	The Partnership has securitized PHC Certificates, MBS, and other tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds into TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P174_S4	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P175_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P175_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are a VIE and the LIFERS owned by the Partnership creates a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P176_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P177_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P177_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P177_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P178_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P178_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P179_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P179_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P179_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P180_S0	The Partnership invests in federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P180_S1	The Partnership owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P180_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P180_S3	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P181_S0	Under the consolidation accounting guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P182_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack: i. the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights; ii.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P182_S1	the obligation to absorb the expected loss of the entity; or iii.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P182_S2	the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P183_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P183_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P183_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners were VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership was the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P183_S3	The guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P184_S0	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of entities which are secured by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S0	In February 2011, the Partnership foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford and one of the Partnership's subsidiaries took 100% ownership interest in these limited liability companies.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S1	As a result, the properties are reported as MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S2	In June 2011, the ownership of Iona Lakes became a not-for-profit entity, which created a re-consideration event and resulted in Iona Lakes no longer being reported as a Consolidated VIE beginning June 1, 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S3	No changes in the VIEs have occurred subsequent to that date.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S4	At December 31, 2012 , the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of three of the remaining VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S5	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership holds four tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased after January 1, 2010, Arbors at Hickory Ridge, Autumn Pines, Vantage at Judson, and Lost Creek.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P185_S6	The evaluation of these entities did not result in required consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P186_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P186_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities' ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S0	Investments in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Property Loans Valuation - As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S1	The Company owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S3	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S5	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P187_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P188_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P189_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S1	At December 31, 2012 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 5.7% to 8.4%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.2% to 9.3% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $10.3 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P190_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P191_S0	The estimated future cash flow of each revenue bond depends on the operations of the underlying property and, therefore, is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts, future real estate operating expenses, and future capital expenditures.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P191_S1	Such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the property operates, the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets, and tax and insurance expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P191_S2	Different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may provide different results.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P191_S3	The Partnership periodically compares its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P192_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P192_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P193_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P194_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P194_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P195_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P195_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P195_S2	The model reflects the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying property over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bond in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P195_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make numerous subjective assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P196_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P197_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P198_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P198_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 6.25% and 7.5% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for multifamily properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P199_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P200_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P201_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P201_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P201_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P202_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P202_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P202_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P202_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P203_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P204_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P205_S0	Evaluation of property loans for potential losses - In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P205_S1	All of these loans are made on a non-recourse basis.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P205_S2	As a result, the repayment of these loans depend on the cash flows generated by the underlying property.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P205_S3	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P205_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the property and compares the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P206_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property's fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P206_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P206_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property's fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P207_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P207_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P208_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S0	Investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive for the sale of the PHC certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S3	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S4	The PHC Certificates are AA and BBB rated by S P. At December 31, 2012, the range of effective yields on the individual PHC certificates was 4.6% to 5.9%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S5	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structured security.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S6	Assuming a 10% adverse change in this key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC certificates would increase to a range of 5.1% to 6.5% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.9 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S7	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P209_S8	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P210_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P210_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_13_ITEM7_P211_S0	A decrease in the ratio of annual appropriations received by the Public Housing Authority from the United States Department of Housing and Development ("HUD") Capital Fund Program compared to the required principal and interest payments due on the loans payable by the Public Housing Authority to the three PHC Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P212_S0	Investment in Mortgage-Backed Securities Valuation - The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P212_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P212_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activityin the market place when available.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S2	At December 31, 2012, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.6% to 5.4%.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S4	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.0% to 5.9% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $2.5 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S5	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P213_S6	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P214_S0	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P214_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of an MBS below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company's intent and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P214_S2	Each MBS security has been rated either "AAA" or "AA" by either S P or Moody's.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P214_S3	A downgrade in rating for and MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody's below the "A" rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other than temporary.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P215_S0	Revenue recognition - tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds - Interest on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is payable solely from the net cash flow of the underlying properties and reserve funds, if any, set aside pursuant to the bond documents.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P215_S1	These bonds are not the obligations of the state or local housing authorities that issued them and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P216_S0	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P216_S1	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P216_S2	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P216_S3	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P216_S4	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P217_S0	Revenue recognition - investments in real estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates - The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P217_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P217_S2	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P218_S0	The Partnership's investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P218_S1	The guidance requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P218_S2	In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, derivative instruments must be appropriately designated, documented and proven to be effective as a hedge.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P218_S3	The Partnership did not designate its current derivatives as qualifying hedges.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P219_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P219_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P219_S2	The fair value adjustment through earnings can cause a significant fluctuation in reported net income although it has no impact on the Partnership's cash flows.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P220_S0	Although the Company utilizes current price quotes by recognized dealers as a basis for estimating the fair value of its interest rate derivative agreements, the calculation of the fair value involves a considerable degree of judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM7_P221_S0	For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see footnote 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Partnership's primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Partnership's exposure to market risks relates primarily to its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and its debt financing.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS are also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P1_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of these tax-exempt investments to decrease.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the tax-exempt assets do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners' capital and book value per unit.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS decreases, the Partnership may need to provide additional collateral for its debt financing secured by these assets.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Partnership bases the fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, which have a limited market, on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P2_S1	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , all of the Partnership 's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management's discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The PHC Certificates were valued using management's yield to maturity analyses and the mortgage-backed securities were priced using third-party pricing services.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Pricing services, broker quotes, and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds and the PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership 's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The nature of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and the debt financing used to finance these assets exposes the Partnership to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS all bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds may additionally pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , the weighted average base rate of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.0%, the weighted average base rate of the PHC Trust Certificates was approximately 5.0% and the weighted average coupon rate of the MBS was approximately 4.1%.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership has a $94.0 million TEBS financing agreement that provides for interest at a floating rate equal to weekly SIFMA plus 190 basis points.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P6_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The effective interest rate for this credit facility as of December 31, 2012 was 2.08% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P6_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2012, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $940,000.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership has $83.9 million in TOB facilities that provide for interest at floating rates based on weekly SIFMA plus an average of 144 basis points.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The effective interest rate for the TOB facilities as of December 31, 2012 was 2.17% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P7_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2012, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $840,000.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The interest rate of the mortgage financing on the MF Properties fluctuates based on the LIBOR.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the cost of borrowing on the debt will increase as the LIBOR increases.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , the outstanding balance of the mortgage financing of the MF Properties was $39.1 million.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The weighted average effective interest rate for 2012 on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2012 was approximately 4.7% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P8_S4	If the average LIBOR Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2012 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $391,000.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership's interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2012:
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P11_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $900,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as compared to an increase of approximately $2.1 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P12_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $400,000 and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The Partnership's primary credit risk is the risk of default on its portfolio of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans collateralized by the multifamily properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P13_S2	In addition, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P13_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P15_S0	A property's ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P16_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P16_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , based on an accumulation of individual circumstances, the Partnership has identified the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for which certain actions were necessary to protect the Partnership's position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , Woodland Park owes the Partnership approximately $15.7 million under tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and approximately $914,000 under a taxable loan.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S2	This taxable loan has a full reserve recorded against it at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S3	Based on the impairment evaluation (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method), the Partnership has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond existed at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S4	However, the evaluation identified the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S5	The Partnership received two interest payments in 2012 but has recorded an additional allowance of approximately $453,000 against the remaining interest receivable in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S6	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and started the judicial foreclosure process in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S7	On February 28, 2013, the court issued a ruling confirming the bond trustee's right to foreclose its first mortgage on the Woodland Park property and confirming that the first mortgage securing the bond is senior to mechanic's liens filed on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P17_S8	and we believe the Partnership will be able to acquire title to the Woodland Property within 75 days.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P18_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the property had 215 units leased out of total available units of 236, or 91% physical occupancy.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P18_S1	As of December 31, 2012, occupancy had decreased to 211 units leased, or 89% physical occupancy which we believe is a temporary decline.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P19_S0	America First Properties Management Company, LLC, an affiliate of AFCA 2, provides management for this property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P19_S1	Measures have been implemented that we believe will maintain the physical occupancy of this property to around 90% for 2013, which will ensure that net operating income is in line with what had been projected for 2013 in the most recent evaluation for other than temporary impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P19_S2	Based on this evaluation, the current unrealized loss on this bond is considered to be temporary.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P19_S3	Although the foreclosure process has taken longer than originally anticipated, the Company continues to believe that the fair value of the Woodland Park property equals or exceeds the carrying amount of the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P20_S0	During the impairment evaluation at December 31, 2011, the Partnership identified an impairment of the Iona Lakes approximate $7.3 million taxable loan as a result of a change in the long-term outlook for this property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P20_S1	Based on the projected future occupancy rates used in our 2011 discounted cash flow model, a resulting loan loss charge and provision for loan losses of approximately $4.2 million was recorded which is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P20_S2	There was no impairment recorded in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P21_S0	The Company also has credit risk in its investment in PHC Certificates, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P21_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P21_S2	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S0	Defaults on its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, taxable loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S1	In addition, if a property's net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S2	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan secured by the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S3	In the event of a default on a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond or taxable loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S4	If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P22_S5	However, such amounts will no longer represent tax-exempt interest to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P23_S0	The Partnership's primary method of managing the credit risks associated with its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans is to perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these mortgage bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance of such property on a continuous basis.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P24_S0	The Company's primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the rating report issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P25_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2012 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_13_ITEM7A_P25_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks on the Partnership will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating strategies at that time and overall business and economic environment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Partners of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P2_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P5_S0	As discussed in Notes 5 and 6, the consolidated financial statements include total tax-exempt investments valued at approximately $210,600,000 (51% of total assets) and $135,700,000 (46% of total assets) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P5_S1	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , management's estimates were based on discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 8, 2013, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P12_S0	AMERICA FIRST TAX EXEMPT INVESTORS, L.P.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P13_S0	America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. (the Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P13_S1	Interest on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P13_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P14_S0	Our general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under provisions of its Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership, the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest, three entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Consolidated Subsidiaries of the Partnership consist of:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P16_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac (Note 11).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P17_S0	Seven multifamily apartments ("MF Properties") of which six are majority owned by a subsidiary of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P17_S1	The seventh MF Property is Maples on 97th whose operating results are reported by the Partnership as a result of a Master Lease Agreement between the Partnership and the owner of that property (Note 4).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P17_S2	Four properties, Crescent Village, Post Woods, and Willow Bend apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ), and the Greens of Pine Glen Property ("Greens Property") are reported as discontinued operations (Note 10).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of the entities which own the multifamily properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds it holds to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P19_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P20_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P20_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P20_S2	Upon adoption of this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P20_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P20_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P22_S0	Stand-alone financial information of the Partnership reported in this Form 10-K includes only the financial position and results of operation of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P22_S1	In the Company's consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P23_S0	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of the VIEs for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to Beneficial Unit Certificate ( BUC ) holders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute tax-exempt income to unitholders, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P24_S0	Purchase Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on business combinations, the Company allocates the total acquisition cost of a property acquired to the land, building, and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P24_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P25_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P25_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P26_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been temporarily increased to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S2	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P27_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company's portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P28_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash, which is legally restricted to use, is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balances, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P28_S1	At December 31, 2012 , certain of our credit facilities require restricted cash balances as additional collateral.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P28_S2	Specifically, the tax-exempt bond securitization ("TEBS") facility, discussed below, required approximately $725,000 , and two of the mortgages required approximately $2.9 million held as restricted cash balances.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P29_S0	Investment in Tax-Exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds and other tax-exempt bonds The Company accounts for its investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P29_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P29_S2	All of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other tax-exempt bonds are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P29_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the tax-exempt interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P30_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P30_S1	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P30_S2	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P30_S3	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P30_S4	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company periodically reviews each of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P32_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P33_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P33_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P34_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serve as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property that serves as collateral on the bond and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P34_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P34_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions the most significant of which include:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P35_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P36_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P37_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P37_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 6.25% and 7.5% which the Company believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for multifamily properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P38_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P39_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P40_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P40_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P40_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, the Company believes that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S4	The difference between the amortized cost basis and the discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate represents the credit loss.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P41_S5	Any residual decline in value would be considered the interest related loss or non-credit loss.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P42_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P43_S0	If the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company owns some tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P44_S1	The discount or premium on a tax-exempt investment is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in investment income in the current period.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company eliminates the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P46_S0	Variable interest entities ( VIEs ) When the Partnership invests in a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is collateralized by a multifamily property, the Partnership will evaluate the entity which owns the property financed by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond to determine if it is a VIE as defined by the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P47_S0	The guidance on consolidations is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P47_S1	If it is determined that the entity is a VIE, the Partnership will then evaluate if it is the primary beneficiary of such VIE, by determining whether the Partnership will absorb the majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns, or both.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the Partnership determines itself to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the assets, liabilities and financial results of the related multifamily property will be consolidated in the Partnership's financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P47_S3	As a result of such consolidation, the tax-exempt or taxable debt financing provided by the Partnership to such consolidated VIE will be eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P47_S4	However, the Partnership will continue to receive interest and principal payments on such debt and these payments will retain their characterization as either tax-exempt or taxable interest for income tax reporting purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P48_S0	Since the Partnership has no legal ownership of the VIEs, creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P49_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates ("PHC Certificates") and mortgage backed securities ("MBS") under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P49_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P49_S2	All of the Company's PHC Certificates and MBS investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P49_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the tax-exempt interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P50_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available and the estimates of the fair values of the PHC certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P51_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P52_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P53_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P53_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S3	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company's intend and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S4	Each MBS security has been rated either "AAA" or "AA" by either S P or Moody's.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P54_S5	A downgrade in rating for each MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody's below the "A" rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other-than-temporary.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P55_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company's investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P55_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19 - 40 years on multifamily residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P55_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P56_S0	Management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P56_S1	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P57_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P58_S0	Funding to the General Partner of Residences at Weatherford.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P58_S1	Together with the General Partner, the Company unsuccessfully appealed the termination.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P59_S0	Based on the termination notice, the Company determined that the property fixed assets of Residences at Weatherford and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond which is eliminated in consolidation were impaired.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P59_S1	As of December 31, 2010, the property fixed assets, consisting of land and land improvements, and the associated tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond owned by the Partnership have been written down to estimated fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P59_S2	The resulting impairment charge of approximately $2.7 million is attributable to the unitholders.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P59_S3	In February 2011, the Company foreclosed on the current ownership and built 76 units on the Weatherford property (Note 8).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P59_S4	There were no real estate impairment charges recognized in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P60_S0	Property Loans In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of the some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P60_S1	The repayment of these loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralizes the loan.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralize the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow ("DCF") models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P61_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P62_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P62_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P63_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P63_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company recognized a provision for loan losses of approximately $0 , $4.2 million , and $562,000 , respectively (Note 9).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P64_S0	Accounting for Tax Exempt Bond Securitization ("TEBS") and Tender Option Bond ("TOB") Financing Arrangements The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (Note 11) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transactions.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P64_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P64_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P65_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P65_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P65_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P66_S0	The TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P66_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P66_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the TEBS Financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P66_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the tender option bond trusts ("TOB Trusts") through their ownership of the residual participating interests ("LIFERS") so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as secured financings.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P67_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS Financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS Financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P68_S0	As part of the TEBS Financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P68_S1	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P69_S0	Other Company investments are securitized into TOB Trusts with Deutsche Bank ( DB ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P69_S1	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests ("SPEARS") and LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P70_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are VIEs and the LIFERS owned by the Company create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P71_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P72_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P72_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P73_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P74_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P74_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS Financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P74_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P75_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P75_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P75_S2	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $4.6 million and $4.7 million , respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P75_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P76_S0	In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), requiring entities to present net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) in either a single continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P76_S1	ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for statements issued by the Company after January 1, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P76_S2	In December 2011, the FASB Issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income, which defers certain portions of ASU 2011-05 and indefinitely deferred the requirement to present classification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P76_S3	The Company early adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2011-05 and ASU No. 2011-12 in 2011 and accordingly 2010 has been retrospectively presented.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P77_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P77_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P77_S2	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P77_S3	The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $10.0 million and $9.6 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively, against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S1	Base interest income on fully performing tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S2	Base interest income on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S3	Past due base interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S6	Past due contingent interest on tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P78_S7	As of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest with the exception of the Woodland Park bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P79_S0	An evaluation was performed during fiscal 2011 which determined that the interest receivable accrued on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P79_S1	The Partnership received two interest payments during 2012 and recorded an additional allowance of approximately $453,000 against the remaining interest receivable in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P80_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (Note 8) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P81_S0	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P82_S0	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned (Note 6 and Note 7).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P83_S1	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P84_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Company's interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P84_S2	The Company is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P84_S3	The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P85_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P86_S0	Net Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P86_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per BUC holder:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P87_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P87_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P87_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P88_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P88_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of such date.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P88_S3	For purposes of the Agreement of Limited Partnership, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (Note 8) will be included in the Partnership's Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P89_S0	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P89_S1	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P90_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs as of the date of the implementation of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P90_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs' net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P91_S0	The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 were as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P92_S0	Although each multifamily property financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P92_S1	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P93_S0	At December 31, 2012 and 2011 , the Partnership determined that five of the entities financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P93_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P93_S2	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of three of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P93_S3	In June 2011, the ownership of Iona Lakes became a not-for-profit entity and Iona Lakes ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P93_S4	The Partnership has also determined that the Exchange Accommodation Titleholder ("EAT (Maples on 97th)") is a VIE based on its Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement and Master Lease Agreement with EAT (Maples on 97th).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these five VIEs and therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P95_S0	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with the five VIEs financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership relate to the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P95_S1	The EAT (Maples on 97th) VIE has no other capital than the funding provided by the Partnership so the risk to the Partnership is that it will not recover the funding already provided.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P96_S0	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P97_S0	At December 31, 2012 , the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree, EAT (Maples on 97th), Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P98_S0	The capital structure of Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest VIEs consists of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P98_S1	The senior debt is in the form of a tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the VIEs' total capital.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P98_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P99_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by four individuals, three of which are related parties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P99_S1	Additionally, each of these properties is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, America First Properties Management Company, LLC ( Properties Management ) which is an affiliate of the Burlington Capital Group, LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_13_ITEM8_P100_S0	In August 2012, the Partnership sold the Commons at Churchland property for approximately $8.1 million resulting in a gain of approximately $1.3 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P100_S1	In a separate August 2012 transaction, the Partnership closed on the purchase of the Maples on 97th property ( replacement property ), located in Omaha, Nebraska, for a purchase price of approximately $5.5 million through the execution of a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement that assigned the right to acquire and own the replacement property to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Title Company (EAT (Maples on 97th)) for a period not to exceed six months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P100_S2	During this six month holding period, the Partnership will rehabilitate the replacement property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P100_S3	The Partnership lent the EAT (Maples on 97th) the necessary funds to purchase the replacement property; there is no other capital within that entity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P101_S0	The EAT (Maples on 97th) then executed a Master Lease Agreement and Construction Management Agreement with the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P101_S1	These two agreements give the Partnership the rights and obligations to manage the replacement property as well as the rehabilitation during the six month hold period.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P101_S2	In addition, the Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement stipulates that title to the Property is to revert back to a subsidiary of the Partnership no later than the end of the six month holding period.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Partnership has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the EAT (Maples on 97th).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P102_S1	Based on the terms of the Master Lease Agreement, the Partnership determined that it will report the rental income and related real estate operating expenses for the Maples on 97th property during the six month holding period as an MF Property since it has all the rights and obligations of landlord for the property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P102_S2	In February 2013, title to the Maples on 97th property transferred to the Partnership from the EAT.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P103_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Partnership also considered the related party relationships of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P103_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P104_S0	The Company does not consolidate two VIE entities, Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P105_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of each VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P105_S1	The significant activities of the VIE that impact the economic performance of the entity include leasing and maintaining apartments, determining if the property is to be sold, decisions relating to debt refinancing, the selection of or replacement of the property manager and the approval of the operating and capital budgets.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P105_S2	As discussed below, while the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P106_S0	Ashley Square - Ashley Square Housing Cooperative acquired the ownership of the Ashley Square apartments in December 2008 from Ashley Square LLC through a warranty deed of transfer and an assumption of debt.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P106_S1	This transfer of ownership constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P107_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P107_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P107_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P108_S0	The VIE is organized as a housing cooperative and the 99% equity owner of this VIE is The Foundation for Affordable Housing ( FAH ), an unaffiliated Nebraska non-profit organization.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P108_S1	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P109_S0	Cross Creek - Cross Creek Apartments Holdings LLC is the owner of the Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P109_S1	On January 1, 2010, Cross Creek Apartment Holdings LLC entered into a new operating agreement and admitted three new members.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P109_S2	These new members committed approximately $2.2 million of capital, payable in three installments including $563,000 on January 1, 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P109_S3	The new operating agreement and admission of new owner members constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in the consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P110_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital at risk.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P110_S1	The senior debt is in the form of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P110_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P111_S0	The three newly admitted members of this VIE are each unaffiliated with the Partnership and have contributed significant equity capital to the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P111_S1	These members collectively control a 99% interest in the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P111_S2	The other 1% member of this VIE is FAH, which is also unaffiliated with the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P111_S3	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following table presents information regarding the carrying value and classification of the assets held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , which constitute a variable interest in Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P113_S0	The following tables provide information about the three VIEs at December 31, 2012 and 2011 in the Partnership's financial statements under the provisions of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P113_S1	These schedules also include information on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership which are eliminated in consolidation, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P113_S2	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds detailed below, the Partnership has made taxable loans to these consolidated VIEs of $10.6 million and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P114_S0	The following tables present the effects of the consolidation of the VIEs on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P115_S0	As discussed above, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P115_S1	The cash flows from the VIEs do not represent cash flows available to the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P116_S0	Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1059142_13_ITEM8_P117_S0	Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 :
1059142_13_ITEM8_P118_S0	Each of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P118_S1	However, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P118_S2	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P118_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P118_S4	Each tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and bears tax-exempt interest at a fixed rate and five of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P119_S0	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Company have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P119_S1	The carrying value of each of the Partnership's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P120_S0	As all of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P120_S1	Due to the limited market for the tax-exempt bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P120_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P121_S0	As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , all of the Company's tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P122_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S1	At December 31, 2012 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 5.7% to 8.4% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.2% to 9.3% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $10.3 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P123_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on these tax-exempt bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , one bond that is in an unrealized loss position have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S2	The valuation of all of the current bonds has improved over the prior year due to changes in the yields of new issuances of tax-exempt investments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S3	The Company has reviewed each of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S4	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on the bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S5	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further, the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, or if the Company's intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P124_S6	The Vantage at Judson bond was purchased in December 2012 so it has been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and the third bond in an unrealized position, Woodlynn Village, has also been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company's ability to recover the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond's entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P126_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P126_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P126_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P126_S3	The revenue, expense, and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P127_S0	The Company previously identified three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for which certain actions may be necessary to protect the Company s position as a secured bondholder and lender.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P127_S1	These bonds were Woodland Park, DeCordova and Weatherford.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P127_S2	The Company foreclosed on the bonds secured by DeCordova and Weatherford in February 2011 and one of the Company's subsidiaries took full ownership of these two properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P127_S3	These properties are now classified and presented as MF Properties of the Company as discussed in Note 8.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P128_S0	The Company has evaluated the Woodland Park bond holding for an other-than-temporary decline in value as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 (see Note 2 for discussion of our impairment testing method).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P128_S1	Based on this evaluation, the Company has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment of the Woodland Park bond existed at December 31, 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P128_S2	However, the evaluation determined that the interest receivable accrued on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded in 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P128_S3	The Partnership received two interest payments in 2012 but has recorded an additional allowance of approximately $453,000 against the remaining interest receivable in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P128_S4	The following provides further background of the circumstances related to the Woodland Park bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S0	In May 2010, there were insufficient funds available for debt service and the property owner did not provide additional capital to fund the shortfall.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S1	As a result, a payment default on the bonds occurred.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S2	In order to protect its investment, the Partnership issued a formal notice of default through the bond trustee and started the judicial foreclosure process.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S3	On February 28, 2013, the court issued a ruling confirming the bond trustee's right to foreclose its first mortgage on the Woodland Park property and confirming that the first mortgage securing the bond is senior to mechanic's liens filed on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S4	and we believe the Partnership will be able to acquire title to the Woodland Property within 75 days.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S5	Upon successfully taking ownership of Woodland Park, the Partnership will have the option of selling the property after converting it to 100% market-rate rents or maintaining the property as a rent restricted property and seeking to place new tax-exempt financing on the property and acquire the bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P129_S6	Although the foreclosure process has taken longer than originally anticipated, the Company continues to believe that the fair value of the Woodland Park property equals or exceeds the carrying amount of the Woodland Park tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P130_S0	As of December 31, 2011, the property had 215 units leased out of total available units of 236 , or 91% physical occupancy.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P130_S1	As of December 31, 2012, occupancy had decreased to 211 units leased, or 89% physical occupancy.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P130_S2	America First Properties Management Company, LLC, an affiliate of AFCA 2, provides management for this property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P130_S3	Measures have been implemented that we believe will maintain the physical occupancy of this property at approximately 89% for 2013, which will ensure that net operating income is in line with what had been projected for 2013 in the most recent evaluation for other than temporary impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P130_S4	Based on this evaluation, the current unrealized loss on this bond is considered to be temporary.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P131_S0	The various revenue and expense projections for the Woodland Park property operations are summarized as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P132_S0	Revenue and expenses projected for 2013 are equal to the property budget.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P132_S1	Budgeted revenues of approximately $1.73 million are based on a budgeted average occupancy of 88%.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P132_S2	Revenues are projected to grow over the ten years in the model to approximately $2.2 million in year ten based on average annual rental increases of 2% and an average occupancy increasing over time to 93%.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P132_S3	Expenses are projected to grow to approximately $1.1 million in year ten based on average annual increases of 2.5%.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P133_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 subordinate tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and a $934,000 subordinate taxable bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P134_S0	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and is currently under construction.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P134_S1	Both bonds mature on February 1, 2053 and carry an annual cash interest rate of 9% plus allow for an additional 3% of interest calculated on the property's cash flows after debt service.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P134_S2	The Vantage at Judson apartments has a construction loan with an unrelated Bank and the Partnership's bonds are second lien borrowings to that construction loan.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P134_S3	The property will have 288 units when construction is completed in the spring of 2014.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P135_S0	The Company has determined that the entity which owns Vantage at Judson apartments is an unrelated not-for-profit which under the accounting guidance is not subject to applying the VIE consolidation guidance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P135_S1	As a result, the property's financial statements are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements of the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P136_S0	Under the terms of a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement, the Partnership has agreed to purchase a new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond of up to $26,687,000 ( Series B Bonds ) which will be delivered by the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond Issuer once the property meets specific obligations and occupancy rates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P136_S1	The Series B Bonds will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the construction loan to the Bank and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 subordinate tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P136_S2	If the property does not meet its specific obligations and required occupancy rate before January 1, 2015, the Partnership has the right to terminate the purchase commitment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P137_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Agreement as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the estimated value of the forward purchase commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P137_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the Partnership has concluded there is no value to the forward purchase commitment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P138_S0	In June 2012, the Partnership acquired a $10.0 million restructured par value tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments, a 348 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Memphis, Tennessee, which represented 100% of the bond issuance for approximately $10.2 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P138_S1	The tax-exempt bond carried an annual interest rate of 7.98% and matures on April 1, 2026 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P138_S2	The bond did not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P139_S0	In conjunction with the purchase of the Arbors of Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, a not-for-profit entity unrelated to the Company acquired the multi-family property securing the bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P139_S1	At closing, the Company also secured a $600,000 promissory note receivable as a fee for identifying this property acquisition and performing the related due diligence.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P140_S0	In December 2012, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond secured by Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments was restructured to an $11.5 million par value tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond with an annual interest rate of 6.25% and maturity of December 1, 2049 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P140_S1	The Partnership then purchased 100% of this bond issuance plus a taxable loan of approximately $191,000 for a payment of approximately $1,041,000 made at closing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P140_S2	In connection with the closing of the restructured tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond, the Company received payment in full of the $600,000 promissory note less costs associated with the transaction and approximately $557,000 has been recorded as other income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P141_S0	In October 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the $9.5 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency as part of a plan of financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Greens Property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P141_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Greens Property were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P141_S2	The Series A bond has a par value of approximately $8.5 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 6.5% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P141_S3	The Series B bond has a par value of approximately $1.0 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 12.0% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P141_S4	Both series of bonds mature on October 1, 2047 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P142_S0	In connection with the bond financing transaction, ownership of the Greens Property was conveyed by the Company to a new ownership entity controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P142_S1	However, because the new ownership entity did not have sufficient equity capital at the time of purchase and the property operations are the sole source of debt service on the Company's bonds, the Company is required to continue to account for the Greens Property as if it is the owner of real estate rather than as a secured lender.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P142_S2	As such, the Company continues to report the results from the Greens Property as discontinued operations in its financial statements as of December 31, 2012 which, among other things, results in the elimination of the bonds in consolidation (Note 10).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S0	In May 2012, the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by GMF-Madison Tower Apartments and GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments were sold for an amount greater than the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S1	The Company received approximately $4.1 million for the GMF-Madison Tower Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and approximately $12.7 million from the GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond resulting in an approximate $668,000 realized gain.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S2	These tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds had been acquired at par on June 1, 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership still owns the taxable revenue bonds secured by these two properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S4	The taxable bond secured by GMF-Madison Tower Apartments carries an annual interest rate of 7.75% and matures on December 1, 2019 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S5	The taxable bond secured by GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments carries an annual interest rate of 6.5% and matures on December 1, 2015 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P143_S6	These taxable bonds were also acquired on June 1, 2011 and have an outstanding combined principal balance of $600,000 as of December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P144_S0	In October 2011, the Briarwood Manor bond was called and retired at par plus accrued interest for approximately $4.9 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P144_S1	This transaction resulted in approximately $445,000 gain reported in the fourth quarter.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P144_S2	The net redemption proceeds were used by the Company to retire its $4.0 million term note with Omaha State Bank.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P144_S3	The Briarwood bond was originally purchased on February 1, 2011 for $4.5 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P145_S0	In May 2011, the outstanding Clarkson College tax-exempt revenue bond held by the Company was retired early for an amount equal to the outstanding principal and base interest plus accrued but unpaid contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P145_S1	As of March 31, 2011, the Company carried the investment in the Clarkson College bond at an estimated fair market value of approximately $5.1 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P145_S2	The retirement of the bond resulted in a payment to the Partnership of approximately $6.1 million consisting of approximately $5.8 million in principal, approximately $16,000 of base interest and approximately $308,000 of accrued contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P146_S0	In November 2010, the Company acquired the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for a 250 unit multifamily apartment complex in Humble, Texas (Houston) known as Autumn Pines for approximately $12.3 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P146_S1	The bond par value is $13.4 million with an annual interest rate of 5.8% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P146_S2	The bond purchase price results in a yield to maturity of approximately 7.0% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P146_S3	The bond matures on October 1, 2046 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S0	In June 2010, the Company acquired all of the $18.3 million tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency in order to provide debt financing for the acquisition and rehabilitation of Crescent Village, Post Woods I, Post Woods II and Willow Bend Apartments in Ohio (the Ohio Properties ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage bonds secured by the Ohio Properties were acquired by the Company at par and were issued in two series.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S2	The Series A bond has a par value of $14.7 million and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 7.0% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S3	The Series B bond has a par value of $3.6 million and bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 10.0% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S4	Neither series provides for contingent interest.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P147_S5	Each series of bonds matures on June 1, 2050 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P148_S0	In connection with the bond financing transaction, ownership of the Ohio Properties was conveyed by the Company to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P148_S1	As of December 31, 2012, the new ownership entities had not invested sufficient equity capital and the property operations are the sole source of debt service on the Company's bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P148_S2	Since the Partnership owned the multi-family properties serving as the collateral for these bonds prior to purchasing the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, the Partnership has yet to be able to recognize for accounting purposes the sale of these MF Properties and the underlying properties are reported as discontinued operations (Note 10).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P148_S3	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Ohio Properties are eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P149_S0	In May 2010, the Company acquired the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond for a 261 unit multifamily apartment complex in San Antonio, Texas known as The Villages at Lost Creek for approximately $15.9 million which represented 100% of the bond issuance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P149_S1	The bond par value is $18.5 million with an annual interest rate of 6.25% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P149_S2	The bond purchase price results in a yield to maturity of approximately 7.55% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P149_S3	The bond matures on June 1, 2041 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P150_S0	Descriptions of certain terms of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds are as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased 100% of the LIFERs in tender option bond trusts ( PHC TOB Trusts ) which acquired approximately $65.3 million of PHC Certificates issued by three trusts ("PHC Trusts") sponsored by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S1	The assets held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S3	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S4	The loans payable by the public housing authorities are not debts, nor guaranteed by the United States of America or HUD.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S5	Interest payable on the public housing authority debt held by the PHC Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P151_S6	The PHC Certificates issued by each of the PHC Trusts have been rated investment grade by Standard Poor's.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P152_S0	The Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P152_S1	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P152_S2	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P152_S3	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after preferred return payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P153_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P154_S0	The Company determined that the three PHC TOB trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of the three PHC TOB trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P154_S1	As a result, the Company reports the PHC TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P155_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P156_S0	The indenture for the PHC TOB trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the PHC TOB trusts to sell the PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P156_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the PHC Certificates' fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P157_S0	The Company had the following investments in the PHC Certificates on December 31, 2012:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P158_S0	Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P158_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P158_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates is based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants which includes adjustments for the fact that the PHC Certificates investment grade rating is below "AAA".
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S1	The PHC Certificates are "AA" and "BBB" rated and the range of effective yields was 4.6% to 5.9% at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC Certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structure security.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S3	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC Certificates would increase to a range of 5.1% to 6.5% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.9 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P159_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P160_S0	The PHC Certificates have been in an unrealized loss position for less than 12 months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P161_S0	The following table sets forth certain information relating to the PHC Certificates held in the PHC TOB Trusts:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company purchased 100% of the LIFERs in five tender option bond trusts MBS TOB Trusts which securitized state issued MBS with a par value of $31.6 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S1	The Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the MBS TOB Trust for approximately $6.5 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S2	The MBS TOB Trust also issued SPEARS of approximately $25.1 million to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S3	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S4	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the MBS TOB Trust on the securitized MBS after payments due to the holders of the SPEARs and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P162_S5	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on SIFMA.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P163_S0	The Company determined that the five MBS TOB trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of them.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P163_S1	As a result, the Company reports the MBS TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P164_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P165_S0	The indenture for the MBS TOB trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the MBS TOB trusts to sell the MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P165_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the MBS' fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P166_S0	The carrying value of the Company's MBS as of December 31, 2012 is as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P167_S0	(1) MBS are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P168_S0	Valuation - The Company values each MBS based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P168_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P168_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S2	At December 31, 2012, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.6% to 5.4% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S4	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.0% to 5.9% and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $2.4 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S5	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S6	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P169_S7	Pricing services and management s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P170_S0	The MBS have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P171_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and interest payable from the MBS is exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P171_S1	Description of certain terms of the Company's MBS is as follows:

1059142_13_ITEM8_P172_S2	The general partners of these partnerships are unaffiliated parties and their 1% ownership interest in these limited partnerships is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P172_S3	The Company expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P172_S4	The Company expects to purchase tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued by the new property owners as part of the restructuring.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P185_S13	The Partnership anticipates it will then purchase tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of such a restructuring.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P186_S0	A condensed balance sheet at the date of acquisition for each of the 2011 acquisitions is included below.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P187_S0	The table below shows the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Maples on 97th, Eagle Village, and Arboretum properties had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P188_S0	For the year ended December 2012, the EAT (Maples on 97th) added approximately $604,000 in total revenue and approximately $235,000 in net loss to the Company since it was acquired on August 29, 2012 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P189_S0	For the year ended December 2011, Eagle Village added approximately $945,000 in total revenue and approximately $257,000 net loss to the Partnership since it was acquired on June 29, 2011 and Arboretum added approximately $1.8 million in total revenue and approximately $695,000 net loss to the Partnership since it was acquired on March 31, 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P190_S0	In addition to the MF Properties, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs in accordance with the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P190_S1	Although the assets of the VIEs are consolidated, the Company has no ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs other than to the extent they serve as collateral for the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P190_S2	The results of operations of those properties are recorded by the Company in consolidation but any net income or loss from these properties does not accrue to the unitholders or the general partner, but is instead included in "Unallocated deficit of variable interest entities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P191_S0	As discussed in Note 4, as the result of the foreclosures of the bonds on Residences at DeCordova and on Residences at Weatherford and the merger of the entity owning Iona Lakes, these three entities are no longer consolidated as Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P191_S1	DeCordova and Weatherford are now reflected as MF Properties and Iona Lakes is now reflected as an investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and other assets.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P192_S0	The Company consolidated the following properties owned by the VIEs in continuing operations as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 :
1059142_13_ITEM8_P193_S0	The Company had the following Other Assets as of dates shown:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P194_S0	In addition to the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, taxable mortgage loans have been made to the owners of the properties which secure certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and are reported as Other Assets, net of allowance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P194_S1	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable loans for impairment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P194_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable loan values.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P195_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P195_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P195_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P196_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 2 above except that the specific discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was 6.5% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P196_S1	The Company believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily property could obtain current tax-exempt financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P196_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P196_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principle balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P197_S0	During 2012, the Company purchased a taxable bond with a par value of $934,000 in conjunction with the purchase of the Vantage at Judson tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and recorded a taxable loan of approximately $191,000 in conjunction with the purchase of the restructured Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P197_S1	The $191,000 Arbors taxable loan has an interest rate of 6.25% and scheduled monthly principal payment over approximately two years commencing on February 2, 2014.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P197_S2	The $934,000 Vantage at Judson taxable bond has an cash interest rate of 9% and requires monthly principal payments commencing in February 2016 with a term date of February 2, 2053.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P198_S0	The following is a summary of the taxable loans, accrued interest and allowance on amounts due at December 31, 2012 and 2011:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P199_S0	During 2012, the Partnership advanced additional funds to Ashley Square, Cross Creek, and Iona Lakes of approximately $108,000 , $150,000 and $402,000 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P199_S1	In addition, Cross Creek paid approximately $330,000 which was applied against the loan receivable.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P199_S2	During 2011, the Partnership advanced additional funds to Cross Creek and Iona Lakes of approximately $381,000 and $618,000 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P199_S3	The Partnership believes that these properties will be self-sufficient from an operating cash flow perspective over the term of the bond but will continue to provide property loan advances to cover their short-term working capital needs.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P204_S1	Prior to the execution of the admittance of the new limited partners, the Company had entered into an agreement to sell the Greens of Pine Glen Property for approximately $7.3 million to the third party not-for-profit which is the general partner of the limited partnership that now owns the Greens Property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P204_S2	That sale was conditional on securing the tax-exempt bond and low-income housing tax credits from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P204_S10	As there will be sufficient equity invested to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes at 75% completion of construction and the Company no longer has responsibility for the general operations of the property, this MF Property has met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and has been reported as such in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P204_S11	The net fixed assets and total assets of the Greens Property were approximately $8.4 million and $12.2 million at December 31, 2012 , and $6.0 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2011.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P211_S0	TOB Financings In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with DB which allows the Company to execute multiple TOB structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P211_S1	Under each TOB structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P211_S2	Theses SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P211_S3	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P211_S4	Under each TOB structure, the asset is transferred to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P212_S0	The Master Trust Agreement with DB has covenants that the Company is required to maintain compliance, the most restrictive of which at December 31, 2012 is that cash available to distribute for the trailing twelve months must be at least two times trailing twelve month interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P212_S1	The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P212_S2	If the Company were to be out of compliance with any of these covenants, it would trigger a termination event of the financing facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P212_S3	The Company expects to renew each of the TOB financing facilities for another one year term as they mature throughout 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S0	In November and December 2012, the Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the trustee over five different TOB Trusts for approximately $6.5 million which are securitizations of mortgage-backed securities ("MBS TOB Trusts") with a par value of approximately $31.6 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by these MBS TOB Trusts on the mortgage- backed securities after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S2	The Company reports the MBS TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities (see Note 7).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S3	The MBS TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $25.1 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S4	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts and some have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S5	On January 17, 2013, the Company purchased an additional $540,000 of LIFERS from one of the five MBS TOB Trusts which is a securitization of MBS with a par value of $2.5 million.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P213_S6	SPEARS of approximately $2 million were issued by the MBS TOB Trust which increased the Company's outstanding borrowings.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P214_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased the PHC Certificate LIFERS issued by the trustee over the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P214_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P214_S2	The Company reports the PHC TOB Trust on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P214_S3	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P214_S4	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S0	In July 2011, the Company closed a $10 million financing utilizing the TOB structure with the securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S1	In December 2011, the Company closed a second $7.8 million TOB financing structure structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments tax-exempt mortgage revenue and taxable mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S2	In May 2012, the Company retired the $7.8 million TOB financing structure when the GMF-Warren/Tulane and GMF-Madison Tower tax-exemept mortgage revenue bonds were sold.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S3	Under these TOB structures, the Company transferred the bonds to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S4	The TOB trustee then issued SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S5	The SPEARS were credit-enhanced by DB and sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S6	The gross proceeds from the sale of the SPEARS were remitted to the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P215_S7	The LIFERS were retained by the Company and are pledged to DB to secure certain reimbursement obligations.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P216_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Company owed $9.8 million on the Autumn Pines TOB financing facility and at December 31, 2011, the Company owed $17.7 million on both TOB facilities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P217_S0	The TOB trusts essentially provide the Company with a secured variable rate debt facility at interest rates that reflect the prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates paid by the TOB trusts on the SPEARS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P217_S1	Payments made to the holders of the SPEARS and the amount of trust fees essentially represent the Company's effective cost of borrowing on the net proceeds it received from the sale of the SPEARS.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P217_S2	The holders of the SPEARS are entitled to receive regular payments from the TOB trusts at a variable rate established by a third party remarketing firm that is expected to be similar to the weekly SIFMA floating index rate.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P217_S3	Payments on the SPEARS will be made prior to any payments on the LIFERS held by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P217_S4	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P218_S0	TEBS Financing As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of thirteen tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds owned by the ATAX TEBS I, LLC (the Sponsor ) pursuant to the TEBS Financing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P218_S1	The TEBS Financing essentially provides the Partnership with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P219_S0	Effective September 1, 2010, the Partnership transferred the following bonds to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Partnership pursuant to the TEBS Financing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P219_S1	The par value of the bonds included in this Financing facility as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 are also presented.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P220_S0	The securitization of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds occurred through two classes of certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P220_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P220_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P221_S0	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain credit, facility, remarketing and servicing fees (the Facility Fees ).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P221_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.13% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.03% on the outstanding balance on the TEBS Financing facility of $94.0 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P221_S2	As of December 31, 2011, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.15% resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.05% on the outstanding balance on the TEBS Financing facility of $94.9 million .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates will be made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S3	The term of the TEBS Financing coincides with the terms of the assets securing the TEBS Certificates, except that the Partnership may terminate the TEBS Financing at its option on either September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S4	Should the Partnership not elect to terminate the TEBS Financing on these dates, the full term of the TEBS Financing runs through the final principal payment date associated with the securitized bonds, or July 15, 2050.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P222_S5	The TOB Financing facilities mature between June 15, 2013 and October 15, 2013 with options available for the Company to extend another year.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P234_S1	The proceeds from such sale will be utilized to retire any associated outstanding mortgage loan.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P234_S2	Should a mortgage loan reach maturity prior to a sale of the associated MF Property, the Partnership would either seek to refinance such mortgage loan or utilize cash reserves to retire the loan.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P234_S3	The Partnership expects to provide tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds as part of an overall plan of financing the acquisition of a MF Property by a new property owner.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S0	AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any of its tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds, taxable loans collateralized by real property, and other tax-exempt investments for which the owner of the financed property or other third party is not obligated to pay such administrative fee directly to AFCA 2.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , the Partnership paid administrative fees to AFCA 2 of approximately $948,000 , $795,000 , and $636,000 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S2	In addition to the administrative fees paid directly by the Partnership, AFCA 2 receives administrative fees directly from the owners of properties financed by certain of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $133,000 , $160,000 , and $209,000 , in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S4	Additionally, in connection with the sale of the Ohio Properties and purchase of the new tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of the transaction (see Note 3 and Note 8), the Ohio Properties paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA 2 totaling approximately $231,000 in 2010.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S5	Eagle Ridge paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA2 totaling approximately $71,000 in 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S6	Although these third party administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S7	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P237_S8	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P238_S0	AFCA 2 earns mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P238_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S0	The Company executed an investment placement agreement with AFCA 2 in connection with the Company's acquisition of the PHC Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S1	AFCA 2 received a fee of $653,000 in July 2012 from the Company in connection with this agreement which was recorded into the cost basis of the PHC Certificates and is being amortized against interest income on an effective yield basis.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S2	The Company executed separate investment placement agreements with AFCA 2 in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and the acquisition of mortgage-backed securities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S3	In connection with the Arbors of Hickory Ridge bond placement agreement, AFCA 2 received an origination fee of $100,000 which has been recorded into the cost basis of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond and is being amortized against interest income on an effective yield basis.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S4	In connection with the mortgage-backed securities agreement, AFCA 2 received an origination fee of approximately $316,000 which has been recorded into the cost basis of the mortgage-backed securities and is being amortized against interest income on an effective yield basis.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S5	These investment placement fees are consistent with the mortgage placement fees that AFCA 2 has earned in connection with the acquisition of tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P239_S6	Investment/mortgage placement fees earned by AFCA 2 totaled approximately $1.4 million , $407,000 , and $461,000 , in 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P240_S0	An affiliate of AFCA 2, America First Property Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ) was retained to provide property management services for Iona Lakes, Bent Tree, Lake Forest, Fairmont Oaks, DeCordova, Eagle Ridge, Crescent Village, Maples on 97th, Meadowview, Willow Bend, Post Woods I, Post Woods II, Churchland, Glynn Place, Greens at Pine Glen, Ashley Square, Clarkson College (bond retired in May 2011), Cross Creek, and Woodland Park.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P240_S2	For the Consolidated VIEs, these management fees are not Partnership expenses but are recorded by each applicable VIE entity and, accordingly, have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P240_S3	Such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by the properties owned by the Consolidated VIEs prior to the payment of any interest on the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership on these properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P240_S4	For the MF Properties, these management fees are considered real estate operating expenses.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P241_S0	The owners of three limited-purpose corporations which own apartment properties financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Company are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Company and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P242_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company has three derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing and mortgages payable.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P242_S1	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P243_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS Financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS Financing to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P243_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS Financing of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P243_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P243_S3	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $900,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as compared to an increase of approximately $2.1 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P244_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P244_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $379,000 and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P245_S0	Existing fair value guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P245_S1	The guidance on fair value measurements:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P246_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P247_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P248_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P248_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P249_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P250_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P251_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P252_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P253_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S0	Investments in Tax-exempt Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S1	The fair values of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S3	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S4	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P254_S5	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P255_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P255_S1	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of the tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P255_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P256_S0	Investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P256_S1	The fair value of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P256_S2	There is no active trading market for the trusts' certificates owned by the Company but the General Partner will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P256_S3	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts' certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P256_S4	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P257_S0	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with similar length of terms.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P257_S1	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P258_S0	The fair value of the Company's investment in mortgage-backed securities is based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P258_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P258_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P259_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P259_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P259_S2	Given these facts, the fair value measurements of the Company's investment in mortgage-backed securities is categorized as Level 2 input.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P260_S0	The effect of the Company's interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Company's variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P260_S1	The effect of the Company's interest rate swap is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P260_S2	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P260_S3	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P261_S0	Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_13_ITEM8_P262_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P263_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value given the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P263_S1	The Company calculates a fair market value of each financial instrument using a discounted cash flow model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for 2011.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P263_S2	The estimated fair value of the Debt financing and Mortgages payable are in the level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P263_S3	Below represents the fair market value of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P264_S0	The Company, from time to time, may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P264_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P265_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P265_S1	While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P266_S0	Certain of the MF Properties own apartment properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P266_S1	In connection with the acquisition of partnership interests in these partnerships by subsidiaries of the Company, the Company has agreed to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to recapture of these tax credits to the extent the recapture liability is due to the operation of the properties in a manner inconsistent with the laws and regulations relating to such tax credits after the date of acquisition.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P266_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because management believes that the likelihood of any payments being required there under is remote.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P267_S0	In October 2012, the limited partnership that owns the Greens Property admitted two entities that are affiliates of Boston Capital ( BC Partners ) as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Greens Property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P267_S1	At closing, the BC Partners invested $961,000 of equity into this limited partnership and is obligated to invest another $2.2 million at contractual scheduled milestones tied to construction, the property reaching a specified debt service coverage ratio, the designation from the state of the tax credits, but the final payment will be received no earlier than October 1, 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P267_S2	In connection with this BC Partners transaction, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of the Greens of Pine Glen limited partnership, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P268_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P268_S1	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P268_S2	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2012 under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is $720,745 which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P269_S0	In October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P269_S1	The BC Partners have agreed to contribute approximately $6.7 million to the equity of these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P269_S2	In February 2013, the BC Partners contributed the equity into the Ohio Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P270_S0	In connection with the Ohio Properties transaction, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P271_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P271_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur, 25% of the BC equity would remain in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed above.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P271_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P271_S3	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2012 under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is $251,745 which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond ( Series C Bonds ) and a $934,000 taxable bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S1	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and is currently under construction.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S2	In connection with the purchase of these bonds, the Partnership also executed a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement with the borrower under the bonds, the issuer of the $6,049,000 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond ( Issuer ), and the Bank which is providing the remainder of the construction financing and has the first lien on the property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S3	Under the terms of this agreement and the Trust Indenture, the Issuer has agreed to fund up to $26,687,000 of senior tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds ( Series B Bonds ) to allow for the full refunding of the Bank's construction loan ( Series A Bonds ) and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 Series C Bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S4	The Partnership has an obligation to purchase the Series B Bonds upon the successful completion of specific conversion conditions.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S5	These conversion conditions include no material default by borrower under the trust indenture, the completion of the survey of the property and title insurance, and occupancy of 90% for 90 days at the property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S6	The amount of the Series B Bonds will be no less than $20,638,000 and the final amount will depend on the Reallocation Calculation which is defined as 80% bond to appraised property value and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.0.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P272_S7	The Partnership expects to purchase the Series B bonds in 2014 but if the conversion conditions are not met by January 1, 2015, the Partnership has the ability to terminate the Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P273_S0	In February 2013, the Partnership obtained a $7.5 million loan secured by the Maples on 97th property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P273_S1	This loan is with an unrelated third party and carries a fixed annual interest rate of 3.55% , maturing on February 10, 2016 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P273_S2	Title to the Maples on 97th property also transferred to the Partnership from the EAT (a wholly-owned subsidiary of an unrelated title company) in February 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P274_S0	In February 2013, the Company executed a new TOB under its credit facility with DB securitizing the Greens of Pine Glen tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P274_S1	The amount borrowed was $5.75 million with a variable interest rate tied to SIFMA and the facility matures in January 2014 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P274_S2	The total cost of borrowing was approximately 2.6% at the time of closing.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P275_S0	On February 14, 2013, the Partnership acquired six tax-exempt bonds secured by three properties located in San Antonio, Texas.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P275_S1	The bond purchases are as follows: a $13.8 million par value Series A and a $3.2 million par value Series B tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Huebner Oaks Apartments, a 344 unit multifamily apartment complex; an $8.9 million Series A and a $2 million Series B tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Las Colinas Apartments, a 232 unit multifamily apartment complex; and an $8.8 million Series A and $1.7 million Series B tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds secured by Perrin Crest Apartments, a 200 unit multifamily apartment complex.

1059142_13_ITEM8_P275_S3	The three Series B tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds each carry a cash interest rate of 9.0% and mature on April 1, 2050 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P275_S4	The Partnership also acquired approximately $645,000 of taxable bonds which also carry a cash interest rate of 9.0% and mature on April 1, 2050 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P276_S0	On February 26, 2013, the Partnership obtained a $6.0 million loan secured by the Iona Lakes tax-exempt mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P276_S1	This loan carries a fixed interest rate of 5.0% and matures on February 25, 2014 .
1059142_13_ITEM8_P277_S0	On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P277_S1	This ASU will be effective for the first interim reporting period in 2013.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P278_S0	The Company consists of five reportable segments, Tax-Exempt Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS Investments, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P278_S1	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P279_S0	The Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment consists of the Company's portfolio of federally tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P279_S1	Such tax exempt bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P279_S2	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company held fifteen tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds not associated with Consolidated VIEs and three tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds associated with Consolidated VIEs which are bonds that are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P279_S3	Additionally, four bonds secured by the Ohio Properties and Greens Property are eliminated upon consolidation in the Company's financial statements and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented (Note 3).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P280_S0	The multifamily apartment properties financed by the 22 tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 3,880 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P281_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily apartment properties which are not currently financed by tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P281_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P281_S2	With the exception of the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property, the Partnership's interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P281_S3	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property are reported as discontinued operations (Note 10).
1059142_13_ITEM8_P282_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in an MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P282_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership's CAD.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P283_S0	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company consolidated the results of seven MF Properties containing a total of 1,346 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P284_S0	Other Tax-Exempt Investments The Partnership Agreement authorizes the Company to make investments in tax-exempt investments other than tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds provided that these other tax-exempt investments are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency and do not constitute more than 25% of the Company's assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P284_S1	In addition, the amount of other tax-exempt investments are limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon for the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P284_S2	The Company currently has other tax-exempt investments, PHC Certificates and MBS which are reported as two separate segments.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P285_S0	The PHC Trusts segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the PHC Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P285_S1	The Partnership consolidates the PHC Trusts due to it's ownership of the LIFERS issued by the three PHC Trusts, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of local public housing authorities.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P285_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under the Capital Fund Program.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P285_S3	This investment has been reported as part of the Partnership balance sheet and results of operations since acquired in July 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P286_S0	The MBS segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the MBS TOB Trusts that the Company consolidated due to its ownership of the LIFERs issued by theMBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P286_S1	These MBS TOB trusts are securitized by state issued mortgage-backed securities which are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P286_S2	This investment was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2012.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P287_S0	Consolidated VIE segment The Consolidated VIE segment consists of multifamily apartment properties which are financed with tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P287_S1	The tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds on these Consolidated VIE properties are eliminated from the Company's financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds are held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P288_S0	The Company does not actually own an equity position in the Consolidated VIEs or their underlying properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P288_S1	As of December 31, 2012 , the Company consolidated three VIE multifamily apartment properties containing a total of 650 rental units.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P288_S2	The Company consolidates a fourth VIE, EAT (Maples on 97th), whose operations are reported within the MF Properties segment due to a Master Lease Arrangement but the real estate assets are reported within the VIE segment.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P289_S0	Management closely monitors and evaluates the financial reporting associated with and the operations of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties and performs such evaluation separately from the other operations of the Partnership through interaction with the affiliated property management company which manages the multifamily apartment properties held by the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P290_S0	Management's goals with respect to the properties constituting the Company's Consolidated VIE and MF Properties reportable segments is to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to (i) make all payments of base interest, and possibly pay contingent interest, on the properties included in the Tax-Exempt Bond Investments segment and the Consolidated VIE segment, and (ii) distribute net rental income to the Partnership from the MF Properties segment until such properties can be refinanced with additional tax-exempt mortgage bonds meeting the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_13_ITEM8_P290_S1	In order to achieve these goals, management of these multifamily apartment properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of its properties in their respective market areas.

1059142_13_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company's management (including officers of the Burlington Capital Group LLC in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of The Burlington Capital Group LLC (in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership), of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company's management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that evaluation, the Partnership's management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012 .

1059142_13_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2012 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1059142_13_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_13_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

1059142_13_ITEM15_P64_S0	I, Timothy Francis, Chief Financial Officer of the general partner of the General Partner of America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P., certify, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. Section 1350, that:
1059142_13_ITEM15_P65_S0	(2) The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership.
1059142_13_ITEM15_P66_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and will be retained by America First Tax Exempt Investors, L.P. and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P0_S0	America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties that provide affordable housing in their market areas.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest received on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P0_S2	As a result, the Partnership expects most of the income it earns is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owned 42 mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $314.7 million as of December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 32 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 5,409 rental units located in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S3	Each bond is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S4	Each of the bonds provides for "base" interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S5	Additionally, four of the bonds also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P1_S6	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac and 13 are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG ("DB") in Tender Option Bond ("TOB") facilities (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included herein).
1059142_14_ITEM1_P2_S1	Two of the entities that own the apartment properties financed by two of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds were deemed to be consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs") of the Partnership at December 31, 2013 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the properties collateralizing our mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P5_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P6_S0	Because the return to the Partnership from its investments in mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the multifamily residential properties which collateralize these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other multifamily rental properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with its mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P7_S0	The Partnership may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by its Agreement of Limited Partnership dated October 1, 1998, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement") and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P7_S1	Under the Partnership Agreement, these other securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P7_S2	In addition, the Partnership Agreement requires management to assess and conclude that the income from these other securities are exempt from inclusion in income for federal taxation purposes at the time of purchase.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership has two other classes of investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts' Certificates ("PHC Certificates") and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS").
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S1	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate principal outstanding of $65.3 million at December 31, 2013 and are securitized into three separate Tender Option Bond financing facilities ("TOB Trusts") with DB ("PHC Trusts") (see Note 11 to the Company's consolidated financial statements included herein).
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S2	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S3	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S4	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P8_S5	The state issued MBS had an aggregate principal outstanding of $42.8 million at December 31, 2013 and have been securitized into six separate TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P9_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and have investment grade ratings by the most recent S P or Moody's rating.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P10_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable property loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P10_S1	The Partnership does this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in the best long-term interest of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Partnership generally does not seek to acquire direct interests in real property as long term or permanent investments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Partnership may, however, acquire real estate securing its mortgage revenue bonds or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P11_S2	In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in bonds issued to finance these properties and which the Partnership expects and believes generate tax-exempt interest.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P11_S3	The Partnership currently holds interests in eight MF Properties containing 1,582 rental units, of which two are located in Nebraska, one is located in Kansas, one is located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Georgia, and two are located in Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P11_S4	The Partnership also has a student housing development under construction at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Ohio Properties and the Greens Property (defined below) were previously reported each as MF Properties but are now reported as discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the Partnership's interests in these properties in connection with the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S0	To restructure each of the MF Properties into a mortgage revenue bond, the Partnership teams with a third party developer who works to secure a mortgage revenue bond issuance from the local housing authority.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S1	Once the developer receives the mortgage revenue bond commitment, the Partnership will sell the MF Property to a not-for-profit entity or to an entity owned by the developer in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ("LIHTCs") under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code").
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire the mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S3	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the Partnership's initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S4	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S5	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, the Partnership will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what management believes is its optimal fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P13_S6	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities as the market for LIHTC syndications continues to strengthen.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P14_S0	The Company currently operates in five reportable business segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments; (2) MF Properties; (3) Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts; (4) MBS Investments; and (5) Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P14_S1	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P14_S2	For a disclosure of the revenues, net income and loss, total assets, and certain other key financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 for each of the Company s five reportable segments, see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included herein.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P15_S0	Nine of the 32 properties which collateralize the bonds owned by the Partnership are managed by America First Properties Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership's general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ("AFCA 2").
1059142_14_ITEM1_P15_S1	In this regards, Properties Management provides property management services for Ashley Square, Bent Tree Apartments, Lake Forest Apartments, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Cross Creek, Crescent Village, Willow Bend, Post Woods (collectively, the "Ohio Properties"), Greens of Pine Glen, (the "Greens Property") and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P15_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to the Partnership and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC relating to these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P15_S3	The properties not currently managed by Properties Management are Arbors at Hickory Ridge, Autumn Pines, Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Renaissance Apartments, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, Avistar in 09 Apartments, Bella Vista Apartments, Bridle Ridge, Brookstone Apartments, Copper Gate Apartments, Runnymede Apartments, South Park Ranch Apartments, The Palms at Premier Park, The Suites on Paseo, Tyler Park Townhomes, Vantage at Harlingen Apartments,Vantage at Judson, Villages at Lost Creek, Westside Village Market, and Woodlynn Village.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P16_S0	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital and (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our shareholders which we expect and believe are substantially exempt from federal income tax.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P16_S1	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily apartment properties, including student housing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P16_S2	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed apartment properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P16_S3	The Partnership expects and believes that any contingent interest it receives will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P17_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our shareholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P17_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by the Partnership Agreement, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P17_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P17_S4	At December 31, 2013, the leverage on the portfolio of the mortgage revenue bonds calculated to a ratio of 55% of the par value of the portfolio.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P18_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P18_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P19_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by multifamily properties that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P19_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required which, if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle the Partnership to receive payment of contingent interest on its bond investment.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P19_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P19_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P19_S4	We may also be able to use a higher-quality investment portfolio to obtain higher leverage to be used to acquire additional investments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P20_S0	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, but may also consider bonds issued to finance student housing projects and housing for senior citizens.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P20_S1	The four basic types of multifamily housing revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM1_P21_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P21_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable apartment project financed with mortgage revenue bonds that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P21_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the apartment project may be rented at market rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P22_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the apartment project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_14_ITEM1_P22_S1	Multifamily housing bonds that were issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P23_S0	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed apartment project.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P23_S1	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P23_S2	We expect to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P23_S3	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P24_S0	The Partnership invests in mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on multifamily apartment projects.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P24_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P24_S2	Four of the mortgage revenue bonds currently owned by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying apartment properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P24_S3	As a result, the amount of interest earned by the Partnership from its investment in mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the properties collateralizing the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P25_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P26_S0	The Partnership may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P26_S1	These securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P27_S0	Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates .
1059142_14_ITEM1_P27_S1	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P27_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P27_S3	The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P27_S4	The PHC Certificates rating by Standard Poor's is investment grade as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P28_S0	The Partnership also invests in state-issued MBS that are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P28_S1	These MBS are rated investment grade by Standard Poor's or Moody's as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable property loans secured by multifamily properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds that are held by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S0	While the Partnership generally does not seek to acquire equity interests in real property as long-term or permanent investments, it may acquire real estate securing its revenue bonds or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S1	In addition, as part of its growth strategy, the Partnership may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to position itself for a future investment in mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such apartment complexes by a new owner.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new mortgage revenue bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S3	The Partnership may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S4	After the LIHTC compliance period, the Partnership would expect to sell its interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek mortgage revenue bond financing on the MF Property which the Partnership could acquire.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S5	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the acquisition by the Partnership of an interest in an MF Property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P30_S6	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P31_S0	There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily housing in the United States.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P31_S1	The HUD reports that there are approximately 7.1 million American households in need of quality affordable housing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P32_S0	The types of mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P32_S1	Investors purchase these bonds because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P33_S0	The National Council of State Housing Agencies Fact Sheet, Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, and HUD have captured some key scale metrics and opportunities of this market:
1059142_14_ITEM1_P34_S0	The number of renters meeting the affordable benchmark (income not exceeding 50% of the area median income) increased by 3.3 million between 2007 and 2011 while the number of renters able to obtain housing assistance expanded by only 225,000.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P35_S0	In addition to mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P35_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with mortgage revenue bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P35_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P35_S3	The Partnership does not invest in LIHTCs, but is attracted to mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and; therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P36_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P36_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property's residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P36_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P37_S0	The 2008 Housing Act simplified and expanded the use of LIHTCs and mortgage revenue bond financing for low-income multifamily housing industry.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P37_S1	Additionally, it exempted newly issued tax-exempt private activity bonds from Alternative Minimum Tax if the multifamily project serving as the collateral for the bond meets certain specific affordable rental unit criteria.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P37_S2	Previously, these tax-exempt private activity bonds were Alternative Minimum Tax preference items for individual taxpayers.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P37_S3	We believe these changes should enhance the Partnership's opportunities for making investments in accordance with its investment criteria.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P38_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting availability of debt financing has improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P38_S1	The decline in construction and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily properties during the recent credit crisis, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership in both mortgage revenue bonds as well as quality MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P38_S2	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P38_S3	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our shareholders in the form of a strong mortgage revenue bond investment.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S0	On the other hand, economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S4	In addition, the current national economic conditions including sluggish job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S5	While some properties have been negatively effected, our overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 88% during 2013 and 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM1_P39_S6	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has increased to approximately 83% during 2013 as compared to 76% during 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional shares or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our operating policy is to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of our mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P41_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio is approximately $314.7 million.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P42_S0	The six TOB financing facilities with DB and the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac, which have an outstanding balance of $174.4 million in total, are the outstanding debt financing arrangements that have securitized mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P42_S1	This calculates to a leverage ratio of 55%.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P42_S2	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 60% and 80% of the total par value of the Partnership's other investments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P43_S0	There are six outstanding TOB facilities at December 31, 2013, which amount to outstanding borrowings of $82.9 million, which are securitizations of the PHC Certificates and MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P43_S1	The par value of the PHC Certificates and MBS is $108.1 million which calculates to a leverage ratio of 77%.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P43_S2	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $57.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P43_S3	These mortgage loans mature at various times from March 2014 through March 2020.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P43_S4	The total debt financing plus mortgage loans of $314.4 million results in a leverage ratio to Partnership Total Assets of 58% as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P44_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.

1059142_14_ITEM1_P45_S1	This redemption resulted in the realization of approximately $6.5 million in contingent interest income and an approximately $4.6 million realized loss on a taxable property loan.

1059142_14_ITEM1_P70_S4	The outstanding balance remains at $13.2 million on December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Partnership is managed by its general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or the "General Partner") which is controlled by its general partner, the Burlington Capital Group LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_14_ITEM1_P71_S1	The persons acting as the Board of Managers and executive officers of Burlington act as the directors and executive officers of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P71_S2	Certain services are provided to the Partnership by other employees of Burlington and the Partnership reimburses Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P71_S3	The Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P71_S4	As of December 31, 2013, there are no employees of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Partnership competes with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership for the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P72_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S0	Because the Partnership holds mortgage revenue bonds secured entirely by multifamily residential properties and holds an interest in the MF Properties, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other residential real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S2	Multifamily properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S3	To compete effectively, the apartment properties financed or owned by the Partnership must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Partnership's apartment properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P73_S5	These apartment properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Partnership believes that each of the MF Properties and the properties collateralizing its mortgage revenue bonds are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Partnership is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, it makes no provision for income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P75_S1	The distributive share of the Partnership's income, deductions and credits is included in each unitholder's income tax return.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Partnership holds its interests in MF Properties through various subsidiaries which are C corporations for income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P76_S1	These subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P76_S2	Therefore, the Partnership is only subject to income taxes on these investments to the extent it receives dividends from the subsidiaries.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P77_S0	The VIEs which are reported on a consolidated basis with the Partnership for GAAP reporting purposes are separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P77_S1	The Partnership does not presently believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP will impact the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to shareholders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute income to shareholders which it believes is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P78_S0	All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, is that of the Partnership and the VIEs on a consolidated basis.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P78_S1	All references to we, us, and the Partnership in this document mean America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P79_S0	As used in this document, the Company refers to the Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and its consolidated variable interest entities.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P80_S0	We are a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P81_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and multifamily real estate properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P82_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P83_S0	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P83_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P84_S0	In connection with the operation of the Partnership, AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments, and taxable property loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P84_S1	Ten of the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership provide for the payment of this administrative fee to the general partner by the owner of the financed property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P84_S2	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P84_S3	Our Partnership Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P84_S4	In addition, our Partnership Agreement provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the general partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P85_S0	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P85_S1	Any mortgage placement fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P85_S2	The amount of mortgage placement fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2 and such property owners.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P86_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of apartment complexes.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P86_S1	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P86_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of apartment complexes financed by additional mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P86_S3	If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P88_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third party investors.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P88_S1	Because each such outside third party effectively holds a share of the sole limited partner s rights and obligations as a limited partner, BUCs are also referred to herein as shares or "units" for purposes of calculating amounts per BUC, and the holders thereof are referred to as shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Partnership's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_14_ITEM1_P89_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Partnership are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Cash distributions from the Partnership may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Partnership currently distributes cash to shareholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.42 and $0.33 per unit, respectively, resulting in the remainder of the $0.50 per unit annual distribution being a return of capital to shareholders for both years.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Although the Partnership may supplement its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless the Partnership is able to increase its cash receipts through completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to maintain its current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if the Partnership completes its current investment plans.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying multifamily properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although our mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying apartment complex.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, except in limited cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying apartment complexes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other apartment complexes, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our bonds are located, there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The principal of most of our mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Similarly, if a mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying multifamily property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will suffer a loss.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In the event a property securing a mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The taxable property loans that we make to owners of the apartment properties that secure mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable property loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable property loans than on the associated mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these taxable property loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, the Partnership does not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable property loan if the property is not in default on the mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future bond financings of these projects.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our plan is to provide mortgage financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For this and other reasons, the Partnership may not be able to sell its interests in the MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the value of the Partnership's interest in MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, the Partnership may incur a loss upon the sale of its interest in an MF Property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, we may not be able to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P17_S5	During the time the Partnership owns an interest in an MF Property, any net income it receives from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any future issuances of additional shares could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Partnership may issue additional shares from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing shares and a decrease in the market price of the shares.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, if additional shares are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per share basis may decline.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with a specific interest rate indices.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P21_S2	All of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to shareholders and may affect the market value of our shares.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P23_S0	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A decrease in the value of our mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P23_S2	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds through the issuance of additional shares or from the proceeds from the sale of existing mortgage revenue bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per share basis may be reduced.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, to mitigate the risks we are exposed to as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S1	However, there is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and these costs may not ultimately turn out to exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There is also a risk that a counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This can result in significant period to period volatility in the Partnership's reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and mortgage-backed securities.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our investment assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable rate.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As the holder of the residual interest, the Partnership is entitled to any remaining interest received by the trust holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents and liquidity providers.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following:
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on a specified index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less interest available to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P30_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the Partnership's return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and no party guarantees the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Partnership holds a residual interest (known as Class B interests in a TEBS financing facility and a LIFER in a TOB financing facility) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to the Partnership as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, the Partnership can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P32_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause the Partnership to lose the assets and other collateral it pledged for such financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then the Partnership will be required, through its guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P34_S5	As a result, the Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose its investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair the Partnership's ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In that situation, it is possible that the Partnership would not be able to recover the investment assets and other collateral it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by the Partnership in such trust or other entity.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth combined with continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, restricted availability of credit, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to a slow economic recovery and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, providing funding to borrowers.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S4	As a result, our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P38_S5	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Federal regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may require us to unwind our tender option bond financing facilities by July 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P40_S0	On December 10, 2013, U.S. regulators finalized the Volcker Rule adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which limits the ability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain types of covered funds (such as private equity funds and hedge funds) or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading in the U.S.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with certain covered funds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As currently structured, TOB Trusts like those used as part of the Company s TOB financing program with DB, fit within the definition of covered funds and will be affected by the Volcker Rule.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The regulators specifically noted that banks will need to evaluate if TOB Trusts are, in fact, covered funds and if so, whether an exception to the definition is available.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The regulators declined to provide a specific exclusion from the definition of "covered funds" for TOB financing programs.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The preamble also notes that participation in a TOB transaction is not prohibited per se, but is subject to the same restrictions on other covered funds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The effective date for the Volcker Rule is April 1, 2014, however the rule provides for a phase in period during which time banks need to make good faith efforts to have full compliance with the rule by July 21, 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S4	There is also a possibility that this compliance or conformance period could be extended by up to two years.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S5	At this time, industry participants are working together to modify the structure of TOBs generally so that they qualify for one of the exceptions contained in the Volcker Rule.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Market participants are confident that they will be able to restructure TOBs to permit banks, such as DB, to continue to sponsor TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As discussed elsewhere in this document, the Company had approximately $164.3 million of outstanding debt financing under its TOB program with DB as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If DB terminates its participation in the TOB program, the Company would likely need to find another source of financing to replace the DB TOB financing.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The Company may not, however, be able to secure such replacement financing at all and if it can get replacement financing, such financing may be on terms less favorable than those offered by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any changes to the Company s TOB financing program with DB required by the Volcker Rule could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Our mortgage revenue bonds are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The majority of our assets consist of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S2	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S5	As a result, our ability to sell our mortgage revenue bonds, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P44_S6	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P45_S0	Delay, Reduction, or Elimination of Appropriations from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can result in payment defaults on the Company's investments in PHC Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The Company has acquired interests (known as "LIFERS") in three tender option bond trusts ( PHC TOB Trusts ), which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P46_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P46_S2	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P46_S3	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P46_S4	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by the Company from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P47_S0	The Company's investment in PHC Certificates and MBS are made pursuant to the provision of its Partnership Agreement that allows investment in securities that are not mortgage revenue bonds backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and provide what the Company expects and believes to be tax-exempt income.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust or any of the MBS was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee over the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Accordingly, the Partnership would be required to liquidate its LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P48_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Likewise, if the Partnership liquidates the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates or MBS will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P48_S2	As a result, the Partnership may not be able to divest its position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the Company's mortgage-backed securities may materially adversely affect our profitability or result in liquidity shortfalls that could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The Company's MBS are secured by pools of mortgages on residential properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P50_S1	In general, the mortgages collateralizing our MBS may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Prepayments on our MBS result when homeowners/mortgagees satisfy (i.e., pay off) the mortgage upon selling or refinancing their mortgaged property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P51_S1	When we acquire a particular MBS, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate which, together with expected coupon income, provides us with an expected yield on such MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P51_S2	If we purchase assets at a premium to par value, and borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will have to amortize the related premium on an accelerated basis.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P51_S3	Conversely, if we purchase assets at a discount to par value, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Prepayment rates on loans are influenced by changes in mortgage and market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P53_S0	In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P53_S1	If general interest rates decline at the same time, the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid (to the extent such assets are available for us to reinvest in).
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P53_S2	In addition, the market value of our MBS may, because of the risk of prepayment, benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P55_S0	All of the apartment properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P55_S2	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P55_S3	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P55_S4	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner's ability to service its debt.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The properties financed by certain of our mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Three of the multifamily housing properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are located in areas that are prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P57_S1	The current insurable value of these three properties is approximately $.50.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property's value.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P58_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the five properties financed by the Partnership that are located in areas rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a five percent deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P58_S2	As a result, if any of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property and this could result in a default on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P58_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P58_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P59_S0	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P61_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P61_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P62_S0	If we acquire ownership of apartment properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P63_S0	We may acquire ownership of apartment complexes financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P63_S1	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of mortgage revenue bonds on these apartment properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P63_S2	In either case, during the time we own an apartment complex, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P63_S3	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates and increases in operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P63_S4	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership's financial results and ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P64_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of multifamily apartment properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P65_S0	We may invest in mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P66_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P66_S2	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P66_S3	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the mortgage revenue bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable property loan.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S3	Any return on this additional investment would be taxable.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P67_S5	The overall return to the Partnership from its investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P68_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We may acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P69_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P69_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P69_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P69_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P70_S0	We have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P71_S0	The Partnership has acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P71_S1	When the Partnership acquires an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after the Partnership acquired its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P71_S2	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The Partnership is not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The Partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because it operates under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P73_S1	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P74_S0	The Partnership engages in transactions with related parties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as the General Partner to the Partnership and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for some of the multifamily apartment properties that underlie our mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own three of the apartment properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans held by the Partnership are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Partnership and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S4	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S5	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm's length.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P75_S6	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P76_S0	Shareholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, or MBS is determined to be taxable.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P77_S0	In each mortgage revenue bond transaction, the governmental issuer, as well as the underlying borrower, has covenanted and agreed to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements necessary to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest earned on the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P77_S1	Failure to comply with such requirements may cause interest on the related issue of bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P78_S0	Should the interest income on a mortgage revenue bond be deemed to be taxable, the bond documents include a variety of rights and remedies that the Partnership has concluded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P78_S1	Under such circumstances, the Partnership would enforce any and all of such rights and remedies as set forth in the related bond documents as well as any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P78_S2	In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any mortgage revenue bond is challenged by the IRS, the Partnership would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and would, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P78_S3	The loss of tax-exemption for any particular issue of bonds would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated issue of bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P78_S4	However, the loss of such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our shareholders of taxable income relating to such bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Certain of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P79_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P79_S3	If the IRS were to determine that these mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P80_S0	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS into trusts and are entitled to a share of the interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interests on senior securities issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Not all of the income received by the Partnership is exempt from taxation.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P82_S0	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable property loans to the owners of properties which are secured by mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P82_S1	The interest income earned by the Partnership on these mortgage loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P82_S2	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a mortgage revenue bond or a taxable property loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P82_S3	In that case, the taxable income received by the Partnership will be allocated to our shareholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P83_S0	If the Partnership was determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for the Partnership and its shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P84_S0	The Partnership has determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P84_S1	The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for the Partnership and allow us to pass through our interest which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt to our shareholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P84_S2	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P84_S3	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by the Partnership to shareholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of the Partnership s earnings and profits.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P84_S4	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The listing of the Partnership s shares for trading on the NASDAQ causes the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends and certain other items.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S2	The Partnership expects and believes that substantially all of the Partnership s gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on its mortgage revenue bonds, but there can be no assurance that will be the case.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S4	In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, the Partnership will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P86_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P87_S0	To the extent the Partnership generates taxable income; shareholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P88_S0	As a partnership, our shareholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by the Partnership, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P89_S0	There are limits on the ability of our shareholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_14_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The ability of shareholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by the Partnership will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for shareholders who are individuals.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership conducts its business operations from and maintains its executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P0_S1	This property is owned by Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Partnership believes that this property is adequate to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P1_S0	Each of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds is collateralized by a multifamily housing property.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P2_S0	As a result of the guidance on consolidations, the Company is required to consolidate certain of the multifamily residential properties securing its bonds because the owners of those properties are treated as Consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company consolidated two multifamily housing properties owned by VIEs located in Florida and South Carolina.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P2_S2	The Partnership does not hold title to the properties owned by the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P3_S0	In addition to the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs, the Company reports the financial results of the MF Properties on a consolidated basis due to the limited partnership interests held by its subsidiary in the partnerships that own the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM2_P3_S1	The Company consolidated nine MF Properties located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas as of December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM2_P4_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for each of the consolidated properties as of December 31, 2013 :
1059142_14_ITEM2_P5_S0	(1) The construction work in process represents the costs related to The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL, a 475 student bed mixed-use project, to be built above a 1,605 parking stall garage to be constructed at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
1059142_14_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is periodically involved in ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, including foreclosure actions relating to properties securing mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM3_P0_S1	In our judgment, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the properties collateralizing the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds are subject the resolution of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P0_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P0_S1	The rights and obligations of shareholders are set forth in the Partnership Agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P1_S0	BUCs of the Partnership trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol "ATAX".
1059142_14_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the BUCs for each quarterly period from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM5_P2_S0	The approximate number of shareholders on December 31, 2013 was 19,400.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distributions to shareholders were made on a quarterly basis during 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 .
1059142_14_ITEM5_P3_S1	Total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were approximately $23,118,000, $20,643,000, and $15,061,000, respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P4_S0	(d) The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM5_P5_S0	See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for information regarding the sources of funds that will be used for cash distributions and for a discussion of factors which may adversely affect the Partnership's ability to make cash distributions at the same levels in 2013 and thereafter.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Partnership did not sell any of its securities during the past three years which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1059142_14_ITEM5_P7_S0	(f) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P0_S0	Set forth below is selected financial data for the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2009 through 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in response to Item 8 of this report.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P0_S2	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and its effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K:
1059142_14_ITEM6_P1_S0	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and it's effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K (continued):
1059142_14_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, Tier 2 income due to the general partner (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), interest rate derivative income or expense (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on assets, deferred gain and related interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to consolidated VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to the Company's net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company uses CAD as a supplemental measurement of its ability to pay distributions.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P4_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of cash available for distribution or "CAD" as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P4_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership's operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P5_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P5_S1	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P5_S2	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P6_S0	The following sets forth a reconciliation of the Company's net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and the Partnership's CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P7_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the shareholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P7_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P8_S1	The Company determined that the approximate $1.8 million gain from the sale of the Ohio Properties was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P8_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P9_S0	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Tier 2 income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P11_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier 2 income.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P12_S0	For 2009, the Tier 2 income distributable to the General Partner was generated by the early redemption of Woodbridge - Bloomington and Woodbridge - Louisville mortgage revenue bond investments, the sale of Oak Grove, and contingent interest received from Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest Apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P12_S1	(2) The Partnership sold the Greens Property in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P12_S2	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P12_S3	For this reason, the General Partner concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S0	(3) The developer income amount represents cash received by the Partnership for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S1	The development under construction at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S2	For purposes of CAD, management is treating these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S3	(4) In July 2013, the Company recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S4	The Company was required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer to the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S5	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by the Partnership between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S6	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM6_P13_S7	(5) The recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties allowed the Company to 1) realize approximately $4.2 million of interest income on the mortgage revenue bonds, 2) recognize approximately $1.1 million of taxable interest income on taxable property loans receivable it holds with the Ohio Properties, and 3) realize a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner owner of the Ohio Properties all in 2013 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM6_P14_S0	Mortgage interest income of $3.5 million of the $4.2 million had been previously received by the Partnership and reported in CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P0_S0	In this Management's Discussion and Analysis, the Partnership refers to America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and its Consolidated Subsidiaries which consist of:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P1_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P2_S0	Nine multifamily apartments ("MF Properties") which are either wholly or majority owned by subsidiaries of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P3_S0	The Company refers to the consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K which include the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Partnership, its Consolidated Subsidiaries and three other consolidated entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P3_S1	All significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Partnership owned 42 mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $314.7 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S1	These bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing of 32 multifamily residential apartments containing a total of 5,409 rental units located in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S2	In each case the Partnership owns, either directly or indirectly, 100% of the bonds issued for these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S3	Each bond is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the financed apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S4	As of December 31, 2012 , the properties underlying the fourteen non-consolidated mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 2,700 rental units.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S5	Two bonds secured by the three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units and two bonds secured by the Greens Property containing 168 rental units are eliminated in consolidation in the Company's financial statements (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements) and the multifamily apartment properties are reported as discontinued operations in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P4_S6	Three bonds secured by three multifamily residential apartments contained 650 rental units are reported as VIEs and are eliminated upon consolidation in 2012, and the property for one bond, Vantage at Judson, is under construction.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P5_S0	The mortgage revenue bond segment reported revenue of approximately $27.8 million, interest expense of approximately $3.3 million and income from continuing operations of approximately $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P5_S1	The mortgage revenue bond investments segment reported revenue of approximately $12.2 million, interest expense of approximately $3.5 million, and income from continuing operations of approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P5_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the mortgage revenue bond segment reported revenue of approximately $12.6 million, interest expense of approximately $4.5 million, and a loss from continuing operations of approximately $0.4 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P6_S0	The increase in income from continuing operations between 2013 and 2012 is comprised of several factors:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P7_S0	The remaining net increase from the acquisitions of new mortgage revenue bonds during 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P8_S0	The majority of the increase in income from continuing operations between 2011 to 2012 resulted from a $4.2 million reserve recorded against the Iona Lakes taxable property loan in 2011 and no taxable property loan reserves recorded in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P8_S1	The remaining reason for the increase is due to the non-cash change in the fair value of the interest rate derivatives; which was a loss of $2.1 million in 2011 versus a loss of approximately $945,000 in 2012, respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2013 and 2012, the Company invested in other types of securities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P9_S1	In accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement, these securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency, must generate income which is exempt from inclusion for federal income taxation purposes at the time of acquisition, and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership's assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P10_S0	Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts' Certificates ("PHC Certificates") .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P10_S1	The PHC Certificates, acquired during July 2012, consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P10_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under it's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P11_S0	At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company owned PHC Certificates with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $65.3 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P11_S1	The PHC Certificates segment reported revenue of approximately $3.3 million, interest expense of approximately $1.3 million, and income from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P11_S2	The PHC Certificates segment reported revenue of approximately $1.6 million, interest expense of approximately $542,000, and income from continuing operations of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P11_S3	The increase in revenue, interest expense, and income from continuing operations can be attributed to only a partial year of investment ownership in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S0	The third class of security owned by the Company is MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Company owned fourteen state-issued MBS with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $42.8 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S2	The MBS were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 and first six months of 2013 and are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S3	The MBS segment reported revenue of approximately $1.6 million, interest expense of approximately $464,000, and income from continuing operations of approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S4	As of December 31, 2012, the Company owned ten state-issued MBS with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $31.6 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S5	The MBS segment reported revenue of approximately $194,000, interest expense of approximately $39,000, and income from continuing operations of $149,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P12_S6	The increase in revenue, interest expense, and income from continuing operations can be attributed to only a partial year of investment ownership in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P13_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily apartment properties, the Partnership may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties, in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through a sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P13_S1	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P13_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P13_S3	The Partnership expects to provide the mortgage revenue bonds to the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P14_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 504 rental units.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P14_S1	In addition, the Partnership's subsidiaries own five MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village, Weatherford, and Woodland Park containing a total of 1,078 rental units, plus The 50/50 Student Housing at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska that is currently under construction (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P14_S2	The MF Properties' operating goal is similar to that of the properties underlying the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P14_S3	As of December 31, 2012, the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 504 rental units and the Partnership's subsidiaries owned four MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village and Weatherford containing a total of 842 rental units.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P15_S0	The MF Properties segment reported revenue of approximately $11.4 million and $7.8 million and a loss from continuing operations of approximately $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P15_S1	The MF Properties segment reported revenue of approximately $5.1 million and a loss from continuing operations of approximately $783,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P15_S2	The increase in revenue and loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year can be attributed to the foreclosure of Woodland Park mortgage revenue bond during 2013 and the acquisition of Maples on 97th properties which was owned an entire year in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P16_S0	The increase in revenue for the year ended 2012 as compared to 2011 is due to having a full year's worth of revenue from the Arboretum and Eagle Village properties which were acquired during 2011 and the Maples on 97th property which was acquired in August 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P16_S1	This increase in revenue was more than offset by an increase in real estate operating expenses and depreciation expense also attributed to these acquired properties as well as real estate operating expenses and depreciation expense from the Weatherford property which finalized construction during the first half of 2012 and was in lease-up at December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P17_S0	As of December 31, 2012, the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three Ohio Properties containing 362 rental units and the Greens Property containing 168 rental units which are reported as discontinued operations (see Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements).

1059142_14_ITEM7_P17_S3	The increase in income between 2011 and 2012 can be attributed to the $1.4 million gain realized from the sales of the Commons at Churchland and Eagle Ridge properties in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P18_S0	In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with DB which allows the Company to execute multiple Tender Option Bond financing facility ("TOB Trust") structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P18_S1	Under each TOB Trust structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues senior floating-rate participation interests ("SPEARS") and residual participating interests ("LIFERS").
1059142_14_ITEM7_P18_S2	These SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P18_S4	During 2013, the Company closed on six new TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P19_S0	During 2012, the Company closed on six new TOB Trusts.

1059142_14_ITEM7_P24_S1	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its consolidated subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P24_S2	The gross proceeds from TEBS financing were approximately $95.8 million.

1059142_14_ITEM7_P26_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting availability of debt financing has improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P26_S1	The decline in construction and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily properties during the previous credit crisis, in our view, will continue to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership in both mortgage revenue bonds as well as quality MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P26_S2	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the apartment properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P26_S3	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our shareholders in the form of a strong mortgage revenue bond investment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P27_S0	On the other hand, economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P27_S1	In addition, the economic conditions including slow job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the apartment properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P27_S2	While some properties have been negatively effected, overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the apartment properties that the Partnership has financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately at 88% during 2013 and 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P27_S3	Overall economic occupancy of the MF Properties has increased to approximately 83% during 2013 as compared to 76% during 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P27_S4	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P28_S0	The following discussion describes the operations and financial results of the individual apartment properties financed by the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and the MF Properties in which it holds an ownership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P28_S1	The discussion also outlines the bond holdings of the Partnership, discusses the significant terms of the bonds and identifies those ownership entities which are Consolidated VIEs of the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P29_S0	(1) Economic occupancy is presented for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P29_S1	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P29_S2	Actual occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented, therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P29_S3	(2) Previous period occupancy numbers are not available, as this is a new investment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P29_S4	(3) Construction on these properties has been completed and the properties are in a lease up and stabilization period.

1059142_14_ITEM7_P135_S3	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P135_S4	In addition, a decrease of approximately $178,000 resulted from a decrease in interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P135_S5	The Company's borrowing cost decreased to approximately 2.6% per annum during 2013 as compared to approximately 2.7% per annum during 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P136_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to offsetting factors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P136_S1	An approximate $623,000 increase is related to increased administrative fees payable to AFCA 2 related to the acquisition of the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS, and the Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments, Vantage at Judson, Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Renaissance Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar in 09, and Vantage at Harlingen Apartments mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P136_S2	The remaining increase is comprised of increased professional fees, printing expenses and travel expenses during 2013 as compared to 2012 offset by incentive compensation recorded in 2012 which did not recur in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P137_S0	The majority of the increase is attributable to the gain of approximately $1.8 million from the recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties and approximately $1.4 million from the recognition of the sale of the Greens Property in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P137_S1	The Company sold Churchland during third quarter of 2012 and recognized a gain of approximately $1.3 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P138_S0	Property revenues increased approximately $2.7 million from the addition of Eagle Village and Arboretum which was acquired after the first quarter 2011, DeCordova and Weatherford which began leasing in 2012, and Maples on 97th which was acquired in third quarter 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P138_S1	Annual net rental revenues per unit related to the MF Properties increased to $5,587 per unit in 2012 from $5,225 in 2011.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P139_S0	Investment income increased during 2012 as compared to 2011 due to offsetting factors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P139_S1	The increases are due to the additional interest payments of approximately $2.3 million from the the PHC Certificates, the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond, MBS, and the Vantage at Judson mortgage revenue bond acquired in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P139_S2	Offsetting these increases was an approximate $659,000 decrease attributable to the redemptions of Briarwood Manor Apartments and Clarkson College mortgage revenue bonds and approximately $230,000 due to the foreclosure of Weatherford in 2011.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P140_S0	Gain on sale and retirements of bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P140_S1	Approximately $668,000 of the gain on sale and retirements of bonds is the result of the sale of the GMF-Madison Tower and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bonds in May 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P140_S2	Approximately $445,000 on the gain on sale and retirements of bonds is the result of the gain on the Briarwood mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P141_S0	Other interest income is comprised mainly of interest income on taxable property loans held by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P141_S1	The decrease in other interest income is attributable to lower levels of taxable property loans outstanding in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P142_S0	The $557,300 reported in 2012 is the payment on a property owner promissory note received upon the restructuring of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P142_S1	Other income in 2011 is comprised mostly of the forgiveness of third party debt related to the DeCordova foreclosure and a $150,000 prepayment penalty received from the Foundation for Affordable Housing in third quarter 2011 which was not repeated in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P143_S0	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties is comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P143_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P143_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P144_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P144_S1	The Arboretum and Eagle Village properties reported approximately $507,000 of expenses which were not included in 2011, Weatherford reported approximately $328,000 of expenses as an MF Property for 2012 as it began lease-up in late March 2012, and DeCordova reported an additional approximate $129,000 due to the beginning lease-up of its 34 new units in third quarter 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P144_S2	In addition, Maples on 97th Apartments reported approximately $243,000 of acquisition and operating expenses as it was acquired in third quarter 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P144_S3	The remaining increases were related to the existing MF Properties normal operating expense increases in salaries, utilities, insurance and repair and maintenance.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P145_S0	During 2012, two interest payments from the Woodland Park bond were received and the remaining accrued interest of approximately $452,700 has been reserved.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P145_S1	During the second quarter of 2011, an impairment of the interest receivable on the Woodland Park bond occurred and an allowance for loss of approximately $953,000 was recorded against the accrued bond interest receivable in 2011.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P146_S0	Depreciation and amortization consists primarily of depreciation associated with the MF Properties, amortization associated with in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB Credit Facilities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P146_S1	The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from the 2011 to 2012 is related to approximately $1.1 million from the Arboretum property (acquired on March 31, 2011), the Eagle Village property acquired at the end of June 2011, the additional depreciation recorded once the Weatherford and DeCordova's construction was completed and placed in service in second and third quarters of 2012, and the acquisition of Maples on 97th acquired in third quarter of 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P147_S0	The increase in interest expense during 2012 compared to 2011 was due to offsetting factors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P147_S1	The Company's borrowing cost remained at approximately 2.7% per annum for both 2011 and 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P147_S2	However, the Company realized approximately $1.2 million increase in interest expense as a result of the higher average principal of outstanding debt in 2012 as compared to 2011.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P147_S3	Offsetting this increase was the approximate $1.1 million decrease from the mark to market adjustment of the Company's derivatives.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P147_S4	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P148_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to incentive compensation, increases in administrative fees due to the increased bond portfolio and increases in professional fees.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S0	Primary sources and uses of funds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S1	Interest earned on the mortgage revenue bonds, including those financing properties held by Consolidated VIEs, represents the Partnership's principal source of cash flow.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S2	The Partnership also earns interest from its PHC Certificates, and MBS and may also receive cash distributions from equity interests held in MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S3	Interest is primarily comprised of base interest payments received on the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S4	Certain of the mortgage revenue bonds may also generate payments of contingent interest to the Partnership from time to time when the underlying apartment properties generate excess cash flow.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P149_S5	Because base interest on each of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds and MBS is fixed, the Partnership's cash receipts tend to be fairly constant period to period unless the Partnership acquires or disposes of its investments in mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P150_S0	Changes in the economic performance of the properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds with a contingent interest provision will affect the amount of contingent interest, if any, paid to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P151_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by their real estate investments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P152_S0	The economic performance of a multifamily apartment property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P152_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P152_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P152_S3	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P153_S0	The primary uses of cash by apartment properties are the payment of operating expenses and debt service.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P154_S0	Other sources of cash available to the Partnership include debt financing, mortgages, and the sale of additional BUCs.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P154_S1	The Company currently has outstanding debt financing of $257.3 million under sixteen separate credit facilities and mortgages of $57.1 million secured by eight MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P155_S0	The Partnership's principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to shareholders, interest and principal on debt financing and general and administrative expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P155_S1	The Partnership also uses cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S0	Distributions to shareholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S1	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by the Partnership from its portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of the Partnership's outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by the Partnership on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by the Partnership and the number of units outstanding.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2013 , the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.42 per unit, see Cash Available for Distribution .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S3	As a result, the Partnership was required to supplement its cash available for distribution during 2013, with unrestricted cash and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current plans to invest the net proceeds it realized from the most recent issuances of BUCs on a leveraged basis.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S4	The General Partner believes that upon completion of its current investment and leverage plans, the Partnership will be able to meet its liquidity requirements, including the payment of expenses, interest on its debt financing, and cash distributions to shareholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of unrestricted cash.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S5	However, if leverage plans are delayed, actual results may vary from current projections.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P156_S6	If the actual CAD generated continues to be less than the regular distribution to shareholders, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Consolidated VIEs' and MF Properties' primary uses of cash are: (i) the payment of operating expenses; and (ii) the payment of debt service.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 40% and 60% of the total par value of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bond portfolio.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P158_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the total par value of the Partnerships' total bond portfolio is approximately $314.7 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P158_S2	The outstanding debt financing arrangements are six TOB facilities with Duetsche Bank AG ("DB") and the TEBS financing agreement with Freddie Mac which have an outstanding balance of $174.4 million in total.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P158_S3	This calculates to a leverage ratio of 55%.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P158_S4	The Partnership's operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage to maintain a level of debt financing between 60% and 80% of the total par value of the Partnership's other investments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P159_S0	There are six outstanding TOB facilities at December 31, 2013, which sum to outstanding borrowings of $82.9 million, which are securitizations of the PHC Certificates and MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P159_S1	The par value of the PHC Certificates and MBS is $108.1 million which calculates to a leverage ratio of 77%.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P159_S2	Additionally, the MF Properties are encumbered by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $57.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P159_S3	These mortgage loans mature at various times from March 2014 through March 2020.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P159_S4	The debt financing plus mortgage loans total $314.4 million results in a leverage ratio to Partnership Total Assets of 58%.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P160_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a long-term debt financing facility pursuant to Freddie Mac's TEBS program.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P160_S1	The TEBS financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P160_S2	The TEBS financing offers several advantages over the Company's previous credit facilities which, over time, are expected to positively impact the generation of CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P160_S3	These advantages include: a longer term thereby addressing the previous refinancing risks, better balance sheet leverage thereby providing additional funds for investment, and a lower initial cost of borrowing.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S0	Under the TEBS financing, the Company transferred thirteen mortgage revenue bonds, which have a total outstanding principal amount of approximately $122.5 million at December 31, 2013, to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Company (the Sponsor ).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S1	The securitization of these mortgage revenue bonds was executed through the issuance of two classes of Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S2	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S3	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S4	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain Facility Fees.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S5	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.25% per annum and the total Facility Fees were 1.9% per annum, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of 2.15% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S6	As of December 31, 2013 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.10% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.00% per annum on the approximate $93.0 million outstanding balance.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P161_S7	As of December 31, 2012 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.13% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.03% per annum on the approximate $94.0 million outstanding balance.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates are made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S3	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S4	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P162_S5	The Company also entered into various subordination and intercreditor agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Company has subordinated its rights and remedies with respect to the taxable property loans made by it to the owners of properties securing certain of the Bonds to the rights of Freddie Mac as the holder of the Bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S0	For financial reporting purposes, the TEBS financing is presented by the Company as a secured financing.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S1	In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with DB which allows the Company to execute multiple TOB structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S2	Under each TOB structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S3	These SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S4	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P163_S5	Under each TOB structure, the asset is transferred to a custodian and trustee that provide these services on behalf of DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P164_S0	The Master Trust Agreement with DB has covenants that the Company is required to maintain compliance, the most restrictive of which at December 31, 2013, is that cash available to distribute for the trailing twelve months must be at least two times trailing twelve month interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P164_S1	The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P164_S2	If the Company were to be out of compliance with any of these covenants, it would trigger a termination event of the financing facilities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P165_S0	In December 2013, the Company executed a new TOB Trust under its credit facility with DB securitizing The Suites on Paseo Series A mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P165_S1	The amount borrowed was approximately $25.8 million with a variable interest rate tied to SIFMA.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P165_S2	The facility matures in December 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P165_S3	On the date of the closing the total fixed TOB Trust fee was approximately 1.6% per annum and the variable rate paid on the TOB Trust on the SPEARS was approximately 0.4% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 2.0% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P165_S4	The outstanding balance remains at approximately $25.8 million on December 31, 2013.

1059142_14_ITEM7_P170_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by these TOB Trusts on the mortgage-backed securities after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs ("MBS TOB Trusts").
1059142_14_ITEM7_P170_S2	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts and some have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P170_S3	The Company reports the MBS TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities (see Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P170_S4	A summary of the six MBS TOB Trusts are as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P171_S0	During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company purchased approximately $6.5 million of LIFERS from securitized MBS TOB Trusts with a par value of approximately $31.6 million of MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P171_S1	The MBS TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $25.1 million to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P171_S2	The approximate outstanding amount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 was $24.1 million which mature in April 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P171_S3	On the date of closing the total fixed TOB Trust fee was approximately 0.9% per annum and the variable rate paid on the SPEARS of approximately 0.3% per annum is tied to SIFMA which results in the total cost of borrowing of approximately 1.2% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P172_S0	In January 2013, the Company purchased an additional $540,000 of LIFERS from one of the five MBS TOB Trusts which is a securitization of MBS with a par value of $2.5 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P172_S1	SPEARS of approximately $2.0 million were issued by the MBS TOB Trust which was outstanding at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P172_S2	This MBS TOB Trust matures in April 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P172_S3	On the date of closing the total fixed TOB Trust fee was approximately 0.9% per annum and the variable rate paid on the SPEARS of approximately 0.3% per annum is tied to SIFMA which results in the total cost of borrowing of approximately 1.2% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P173_S0	In April 2013, the Company purchased approximately $2.2 million of LIFERS issued by a new MBS TOB Trust which is the securitization of MBS with a par value of approximately $10.0 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P173_S1	The MBS TOB Trusts issued SPEARS of approximately $7.8 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P173_S2	This facility matures in February 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P173_S3	On the date of closing the total fixed TOB Trust fee was approximately 0.9% per annum and the variable rate paid on the SPEARS of approximately 0.1% per annum is tied to SIFMA which results in the total cost of borrowing of approximately 1.0% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P174_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased the PHC Certificate LIFERS issued by the trustee over the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P174_S1	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P174_S2	The Company is reporting the PHC TOB Trust on a consolidated basis as it has determined it is the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P174_S3	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors which is the outstanding amount at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P174_S4	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S0	In July 2011, the Company closed a $10 million financing utilizing the TOB structure with the securitization of the Company's $13.4 million Autumn Pines Apartments mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S1	In December 2011, the Company closed a second $7.8 million TOB financing structured as a securitization of the Company's $15.6 million GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments and GMF-Madison apartments mortgage revenue and taxable property bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S2	The SPEARS were credit-enhanced by DB and sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors and the gross proceeds from their sale were remitted to the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S3	The LIFERS were retained by the Company and are pledged to DB to secure certain reimbursement obligations.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S4	In May 2012, the Company retired the $7.8 million TOB financing structure when the GMF-Warren/Tulane and GMF-Madison Tower mortgage revenue bonds were sold.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P175_S5	At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, the Company owed $9.8 million on the Autumn Pines TOB financing facility and at December 31, 2011, the Company owed $17.7 million on both TOB facilities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P176_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the PHC TOB Trusts required approximately $400,000, and the MBS TOB Trusts required approximately $4.1 million held in restricted cash (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P176_S1	As of December 31, 2012 there was no restricted cash held as collateral required by these trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P177_S0	As a result, the TOB trusts essentially provide the Company with a secured variable rate debt facility at interest rates that reflect the prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates paid by the TOB trusts on the SPEARS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P177_S1	Payments made to the holders of the SPEARS and the amount of trust fees essentially represent the Company's effective cost of borrowing on the net proceeds it received from the sale of the SPEARS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P177_S2	The holders of the SPEARS are entitled to receive regular payments from the TOB trusts at a variable rate established by a third party remarketing firm that is expected to be similar to the weekly SIFMA floating index rate.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P177_S3	Payments on the SPEARS will be made prior to any payments on the LIFERS held by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P177_S4	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P178_S0	The following table summarizes the amounts outstanding under each TOB Trust and the variable interest rate as of December 31, 2013:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P179_S0	(1) Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, and Avistar in 09 Apartments is the collateral for the $20.0 million TOB Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P179_S1	(2) Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, and Avistar on the Boulevard is the collateral for the approximate $13.2 million TOB Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S1	In November 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $225 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S2	In December 2013, the Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $6.25 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $48.2 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $3.5 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S4	In January and February 2014, the Partnership issued an additional 9,200,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.95 per BUC pursuant to this Registration Statement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $51.4 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $4.5 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S6	In May 2012, the Partnership issued an additional 12,650,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.06 per BUC pursuant to a previously filed Registration Statement on Form S-3.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P180_S7	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $60.0 million after payment of an underwriter's discount and other offering costs of approximately $4.0 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S0	On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $6.8 million compared to the same period a year earlier mainly due to changes in working capital components.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S1	Cash used for investing activities increased approximately $61.1 million for 2013 as compared to 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S2	During 2013, the Company used approximately $164.2 million for the purchase of the mortgage revenue bonds and related taxable mortgage bonds, and MBS compared to $132.2 million in 2012 to purchase the PHC Certificates, MBS, the Arbors at Hickory Ridge and the Vantage at Judson mortgage revenue bonds, The Company spent approximately $13.0 million and $8.0 million on the construction of the MF Properties in 2013 and 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S3	During 2012, the Company purchased the Maples on 97th property for approximately $5.5 million but did not have any cash outflows for the purchase of MF Properties in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S4	Offsetting the use of cash from investing activities, the Company received approximately $4.0 million in net cash related to the realization of the Ohio Properties sale, approximately $21.9 million from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption, and approximately $2.8 million from principal repayments related to investments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P181_S5	During 2012, the Company received cash from the sale of the GMF-Madison Tower and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bonds, the restructuring of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond, the sale of a mortgage-backed security, the sale of the Churchland and the Eagle Ridge properties, and the net release of restricted cash which totaled approximately $47.5 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P182_S0	Financing cash flows in 2013 included approximately $48.2 million of cash from the sale of BUCs, approximately $81.5 million of cash from new TOB Trust financing facilities, $20.7 million of cash from borrowing on Maples on 97th, Woodland Park and the The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project, offset by the use of cash to pay distributions and principal payments on debt.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P182_S1	Financing cash flows in 2012 included approximately $60.0 million of cash from the equity raise in second quarter 2012 and approximately $74.1 million from the PHC and MBS TOB Trusts borrowings, offset by the use of cash to payoff the GMF Warren/Tulane TOB facility and the payoff of the mortgages on the Churchland and Greens Property which were sold in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P182_S2	Cash distributions increased year over year due to the additional shares outstanding resulting from the November 2013 equity raise.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P183_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership's ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P183_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P184_S0	To calculate CAD, the Partnership adds back non-cash expenses consisting of amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for loan losses, impairments on bonds, losses related to VIEs including depreciation expense, and income received in cash from transactions which have been eliminated in consolidation, to the Partnership s net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP and deducts Tier 2 income attributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P185_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P185_S1	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership's computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P185_S2	Although the Company considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P186_S0	CAD for the year ended 2013 included income from certain transactions which may not recur in future quarters as detailed in the following paragraphs.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P186_S1	For the year ended 2013 the Partnership reported $0.42 of CAD per unit which includes $0.065 of CAD per unit (approximately $2.8 million of CAD) from the redemption of the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond and interest and other income recognized from the Ohio Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S0	The Partnership has made annual cash distributions of $0.50 per unit since 2009.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S1	Since realized CAD per unit was less than $0.50 per unit in 2013, 2102, and 2011, the Partnership paid approximately $4.0 million, $5.8 million, and $3.9 million of the distribution using unrestricted cash to supplement the deficit in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, which was a return of capital to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S2	The Partnership has historically supplemented its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash when necessary and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current plans to invest the net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of BUCs in December 2013 and January 2014 on a leveraged basis.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S3	The General Partner has identified a pipeline of mortgage revenue bonds it intends to acquire in 2014 and is actively performing due diligence on these mortgage revenue bonds to ensure they meet the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S4	The General Partner is also working with the Partnership's primary lender to finance a portion of the acquisition of these bonds and believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to shareholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S5	However, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be unable to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P187_S6	In that case, the annual distribution rate per unit may need to be reduced.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P188_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership s net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to its CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 .
1059142_14_ITEM7_P189_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the shareholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P189_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P190_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P190_S1	The Company determined that the approximate $1.8 million gain from the sale of the Ohio Properties was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P190_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P191_S0	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the discontinued operations (Churchland at Commons and Eagle Village MF Properties).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P192_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Tier 2 income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P193_S0	(2) The Partnership sold the Greens Property in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P193_S1	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P193_S2	For this reason, the General Partner concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S0	(3) The developer income amount represents cash received by the Partnership for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S1	The development under construction at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S2	For purposes of CAD, management is treating these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S3	(4) In July 2013, the Company recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S4	The Company was required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer to the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S5	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by the Partnership between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S6	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P194_S7	(5) The recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties allowed the Company to 1) realize approximately $4.2 million of interest income on the mortgage revenue bonds, 2) recognize approximately $1.1 million of taxable interest income on taxable property loans receivable it holds with the Ohio Properties, and 3) realize a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner owner of the Ohio Properties all in 2013 (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P195_S0	Mortgage interest income of $3.5 million of the $4.2 million had been previously received by the Partnership and reported in CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P196_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Partnership held mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by multifamily housing projects.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P196_S1	The multifamily housing projects are owned by entities that are not controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P196_S2	The Partnership has no equity interest in these entities and does not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P196_S3	Some of the ownership entities are deemed to be Consolidated VIEs and are consolidated with the Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P196_S4	The VIEs that are consolidated with the Partnership do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P197_S0	The Partnership does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P197_S1	As such, the Partnership is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P198_S0	The Partnership does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Partnership or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 14 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P199_S0	The Partnership has the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P200_S0	As discussed in Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2013 consist of the paydowns on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P200_S1	The Partnership plans to refinance the current maturing mortgages and TOB debt financing facilities in the first half of 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P201_S0	In August 2013, the Partnership acquired a approximate $6.7 million par value Series C mortgage revenue bond secured by the Vantage at Harlingen Apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P201_S1	Under the terms of a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement, the Partnership has agreed to purchase a new mortgage revenue bond between $18,000,000 to $24,692,000 ( Harlingen Series B Bond ) secured by the Vantage at Harlingen apartments which will be delivered by the mortgage revenue bond issuer once the property meets specific obligations and occupancy rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P201_S2	The final amount of the Series B Bond will depend on the appraisal of the stabilized property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P201_S3	The Harlingen Series B Bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the construction loan to the bank and all or a portion of the $6.7 million subordinate Series C mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P202_S0	The Partnership accounts for the bond purchase commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in the estimated fair value of the bond purchase commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P202_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the Partnership estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $1.7 million (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S0	In April 2013, the Partnership acquired the Series C mortgage revenue bond secured by the Renaissance Gateway Apartments, a 208 unit multifamily apartment complex located in New Orleans, Louisiana for approximately $2.9 million par value.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S1	In the third and fourth quarters of 2013, the Partnership purchased approximately $1.3 million par value Series B and approximately $3.8 million par value Series A, respectively, mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S2	The Series C mortgage revenue bond carries a base interest rate of 12.0% per annum and matures on June 1, 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S3	The Series A and Series B mortgage revenue bonds carry a base interest rate of 6% and 12% per annum, respectively, maturing on June 1, 2030.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S4	This property is undergoing a major rehabilitation and the Partnership has agreed to fund a total of approximately $8.6 million of a Series A mortgage revenue bond during construction which is estimated to be completed on June 30, 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S5	Upon completion of construction and stabilization, the approximate $2.9 million Series C bond will be paid back on the earlier of when the property receives its final equity contribution by the limited partner or June 1, 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S6	The Partnership accounts for the bond purchase commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in estimated fair value of the bond purchase commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P203_S7	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $600,000 (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S0	In March 2013, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company executed a 35-year ground lease with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln ( Lessor ) with an annual lease payment of $100.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S1	The leased property will have a mixed-use development consisting of a 1,605 stall parking garage and 475 bed student housing mixed-use project constructed on it.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S2	The Lessor will own the parking garage and the Company will own the student housing.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S3	The Company currently estimates the construction of The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project will cost approximately $34.0 million and executed a guaranteed maximum price contract with the general contractor for the construction.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S4	The lease agreement has a stipulation that if the parking garage is not completed by August 1, 2014, the Company will pay damages of $6,000 per day of delayed completion to the Lessor.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S5	The Company's construction contract with the general contractor also stipulates that the general contractor will pay the Company $6,000 per day of liquidated damages for each day subsequent to August 1, 2014 that the parking garage is not completed.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P204_S6	Construction has commenced and is estimated to be completed before the August 1, 2014 deadline.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P205_S0	To finance the construction of The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project, the Company has executed an interest-only loan to borrow up to $25.5 million for a three year term at a variable interest rate.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P205_S1	The Company also secured $4.3 million tax-incremental financing loan which is for a term of five years, carries a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.7% per annum, requires principal payments commencing after 24 months and has a balloon payment due at maturity.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P205_S2	The Company has borrowed approximately $7.2 million on the first facility as of December 31, 2013 (see Notes 8, 12, and 17 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P206_S0	In June 2013, the Partnership executed a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase an $8.0 million new mortgage revenue bond and a $500,000 taxable mortgage bond both secured by a multifamily property under construction in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P206_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum, the taxable mortgage bond will have a stated rate of 12% per annum, and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P207_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P207_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership has estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $600,000 (see Note17 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 mortgage revenue bond ( Series C Bonds ) and a $934,000 taxable mortgage bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S1	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and is currently under construction.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S2	In connection with the purchase of these bonds, the Partnership also executed a Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement with the borrower under the bonds, the issuer of the $6,049,000 mortgage revenue bond ( Issuer ), and the Bank which is providing the remainder of the construction financing and has the first lien on the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S3	Under the terms of this agreement and the Trust Indenture, the Issuer has agreed to fund up to $26,687,000 of senior mortgage revenue bonds ( Series B Bonds ) to allow for the full refunding of the Bank's construction loan ( Series A Bonds ) and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 Series C Bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S4	The Partnership has an obligation to purchase the Series B Bonds upon the successful completion of specific conversion conditions.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S5	These conversion conditions include no material default by borrower under the trust indenture, the completion of the survey of the property and title insurance, and occupancy of 90% for 90 days at the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S6	The amount of the Series B Bonds will be no less than $20,638,000 and the final amount will depend on the reallocation calculation which is defined as 80% bond to appraised property value and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.0.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S7	The Partnership expects to purchase the Series B bonds in 2014 but if the conversion conditions are not met by January 1, 2015, the Partnership has the ability to terminate the Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P208_S8	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership has estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $2.0 million (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).
1059142_14_ITEM7_P209_S0	With respect to the financial results of the Partnership's investments in mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the multifamily residential properties, which collateralize the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P209_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P209_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P209_S3	Inflation did not have a significant impact on the Partnership's financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P210_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P210_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P211_S0	All of the Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P211_S1	The Company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies because they involve judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P211_S2	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P212_S0	Accounting for the TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements The Company evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P212_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P212_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P213_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P213_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P213_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P214_S0	The TEBS financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P214_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P214_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P214_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to derecognize the assets resulting in the TEBS financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P214_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the assets held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the LIFERS so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P215_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS financing (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of the consolidation guidance.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P215_S1	As part of the TEBS financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P215_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P215_S3	The Partnership has securitized PHC Certificates, MBS, and other mortgage revenue bonds into TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P215_S4	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P216_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P216_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are a VIE and the LIFERS owned by the Partnership creates a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P217_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P218_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P218_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P218_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P219_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P219_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P220_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P220_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS financing and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P220_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P221_S0	The Partnership invests in mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P221_S1	The Partnership owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P221_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable property loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P222_S0	Although each multifamily property financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P223_S0	Under the consolidation accounting guidance (effective January 1, 2010), the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P224_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack: i. the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights; ii.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P224_S1	the obligation to absorb the expected loss of the entity; or iii.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P224_S2	the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P225_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P225_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P225_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners were VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership was the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P225_S3	The guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P226_S0	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of entities which are secured by the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P226_S1	In December2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity, which created a re-consideration event and resulted in Lake Forest no longer being reported as a Consolidated VIE beginning December 1, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P226_S2	No changes in the VIEs have occurred subsequent to that date.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P226_S3	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of two of the VIEs; Bent Tree, and Fairmont Oaks and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P226_S4	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership held multiple mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased after January 1, 2010; the evaluation of these entities did not result in required consolidation.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P227_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P227_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities' ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Property Loans Valuation - As all of the Company's investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S1	The Company owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S3	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S5	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P228_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P229_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , all of the Company's mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P230_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 6.3% to 9.8% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.9% to 10.8% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $22.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P231_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P232_S0	The estimated future cash flow of each revenue bond depends on the operations of the underlying property and, therefore, is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts, future real estate operating expenses, and future capital expenditures.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P232_S1	Such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the property operates, the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets, and tax and insurance expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P232_S2	Different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may provide different results.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P232_S3	The Partnership periodically compares its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P233_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P233_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P234_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P235_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P235_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P236_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P236_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P236_S2	The model reflects the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying property over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bond in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P236_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make numerous subjective assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P237_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P238_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P239_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P239_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 6.25% and 7.4% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for multifamily properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P240_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P241_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P242_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P242_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P242_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P243_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P243_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P243_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P243_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P244_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P245_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P246_S0	Evaluation of property loans for potential losses - In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P246_S1	All of these loans are made on a non-recourse basis.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P246_S2	As a result, the repayment of these loans depend on the cash flows generated by the underlying property.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P246_S3	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P246_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the property and compares the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P247_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property's fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P247_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P247_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property's fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P248_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P248_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P249_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive for the sale of the PHC certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S3	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S4	The PHC Certificates are AA and BBB rated by S P. At December 31, 2013, the range of effective yields on the individual PHC certificates was 4.2% to 5.4% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S5	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structured security.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S6	Assuming a ten percent adverse change in this key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC certificates would increase to a range of 5.8% to 7.2% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.9 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S7	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P250_S8	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P251_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P251_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_14_ITEM7_P252_S0	A decrease in the ratio of annual appropriations received by the Public Housing Authority from the HUD Capital Fund Program compared to the required principal and interest payments due on the loans payable by the Public Housing Authority to the three separate TOB Trusts with DB ("PHC Trusts").
1059142_14_ITEM7_P253_S0	Investment in Mortgage-Backed Securities Valuation - The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P253_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P253_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P254_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P254_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P254_S2	At December 31, 2013, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.6% to 5.4% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P254_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P254_S4	Assuming a ten percent adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.9% to 5.7% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $2.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P255_S0	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P255_S1	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P256_S0	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P256_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of an MBS below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company's intent and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P256_S2	Each MBS security has been rated either "AAA" or "AA" by either S P or Moody's.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P256_S3	A downgrade in rating for and MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody's below the "A" rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other than temporary.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P257_S0	Revenue recognition - mortgage revenue bonds - Interest on the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds is payable solely from the net cash flow of the underlying properties and reserve funds, if any, set aside pursuant to the bond documents.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P257_S1	These bonds are not the obligations of the state or local housing authorities that issued them and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P258_S0	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P258_S1	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P258_S2	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P258_S3	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P258_S4	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P259_S0	Revenue recognition - investments in real estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates - The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P259_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P259_S2	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P260_S0	The Partnership's investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P260_S1	The guidance requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P260_S2	In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, derivative instruments must be appropriately designated, documented and proven to be effective as a hedge.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P260_S3	The Partnership did not designate its current derivatives as qualifying hedges.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P261_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P261_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P261_S2	The fair value adjustment through earnings can cause a significant fluctuation in reported net income although it has no impact on the Partnership's cash flows.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P262_S0	Although the Company utilizes current price quotes by recognized dealers as a basis for estimating the fair value of its interest rate derivative agreements, the calculation of the fair value involves a considerable degree of judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM7_P263_S0	For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see footnote 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Partnership's primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Partnership's exposure to market risks relates primarily to its investments in mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and its debt financing.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS are also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P1_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of these investments to decrease.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the assets do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners' capital and book value per unit.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS decreases, the Partnership may need to provide additional collateral for its debt financing secured by these assets.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Partnership bases the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, which have a limited market, on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P2_S1	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , all of the Partnership 's mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management's discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The PHC Certificates were valued using management's yield to maturity analyses and the mortgage-backed securities were priced using third-party pricing services.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Pricing services, broker quotes, and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds and the PHC Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership 's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership's control.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The nature of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and the debt financing used to finance these assets exposes the Partnership to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS all bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds may additionally pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2013 , the weighted average base rate of the mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.0% per annum, the weighted average base rate of the PHC Trust Certificates was approximately 5.0% per annum and the weighted average coupon rate of the MBS was approximately 4.0% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership has approximately $93.0 million TEBS financing agreement that provides for interest at a floating rate equal to weekly SIFMA plus 190 basis points.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P6_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The effective interest rate for this credit facility as of December 31, 2013 was 2.00% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P6_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $930,000.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership has approximately $164.3 million in TOB facilities that provide for interest at floating rates based on weekly SIFMA plus a fee stack.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As a result, the Partnership's cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The effective interest rate for the TOB facilities as of December 31, 2013 was 2.20% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P7_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.7 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The interest rate of the mortgage financing on the MF Properties fluctuates based on the LIBOR.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the cost of borrowing on the debt will increase as the LIBOR increases.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the outstanding balance of the mortgage financing of the MF Properties was $57.1 million.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The weighted average effective interest rate for 2013 on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2013 was approximately 4.6% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P8_S4	If the average LIBOR Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2013 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $498,000.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate TEBS financing, the Sponsor entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS financing facility to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS financing facility of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P10_S2	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership's interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2013:
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P11_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P11_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $284,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , as compared to an increase of approximately $900,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P12_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $888,000 and $379,000 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The Partnership's primary credit risk is the risk of default on its portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans collateralized by the multifamily properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P13_S2	In addition, the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable property loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P13_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable property loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership's mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P15_S0	A property's ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P16_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P16_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P17_S0	The Company also has credit risk in its investment in PHC Certificates, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P17_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P17_S2	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P18_S0	Defaults on its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable property loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to shareholders.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P18_S1	In addition, if a property's net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P18_S2	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan secured by the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P19_S0	In the event of a default on a mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P19_S1	If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted mortgage revenue bond, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P19_S2	If such an event occurs, such amounts may not provide tax-exempt income to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P20_S0	The Partnership's primary method of managing the credit risks associated with its mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans is to perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these mortgage revenue bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance of such property on a continuous basis.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P21_S0	The Company's primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the rating report issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P22_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2013 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_14_ITEM7A_P22_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks on the Partnership will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership's risk mitigating strategies at that time and overall business and economic environment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Partners of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P1_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P1_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P2_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P3_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P3_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P3_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P4_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P5_S0	As discussed in Notes 5 6 and 9, the consolidated financial statements include total investments valued at approximately $351,500,000 (66% of total assets) and $210,600,000 (51% of total assets) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P5_S1	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , management's estimates were based on discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P6_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 7, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P12_S0	America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. (the Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P12_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P13_S0	Our general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P13_S1	The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under provisions of its Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P14_S0	Principles of Consolidation The Company refers to the Partnership and the consolidated VIEs (defined below).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P15_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership, the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest, two entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily apartment properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ("VIEs") of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P15_S1	The Consolidated Subsidiaries of the Partnership consist of:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P16_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac (Note 10).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P17_S0	Nine multifamily apartments ("MF Properties") which are either wholly or majority owned by subsidiaries of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of the entities which own the multifamily properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds it holds to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P19_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity's activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity's activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P20_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P20_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P20_S2	Upon adoption of this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P20_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P20_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P22_S0	Stand-alone financial information of the Partnership reported in this Form 10-K includes only the financial position and results of operation of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P22_S1	In the Company's consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P23_S0	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of the VIEs for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership's tax status, amounts reported to Beneficial Unit Certificate ( BUC ) holders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership's ability to distribute income to unitholders which it believes to be tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P24_S0	Acquisition Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on acquisition accounting, the Company allocates the total acquisition cost of a property acquired to the land, building, and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P24_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P25_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P25_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P26_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is equal to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S2	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P27_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company's portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P28_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash, which is legally restricted to use, is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balances, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P28_S1	At December 31, 2013 , certain of our credit facilities require restricted cash balances as additional collateral.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P28_S2	Specifically, the mortgage revenue bond securitization ("TEBS") financing facility, discussed below, required approximately $727,000 , the three tender option bonds ("TOB") trusts ("TOB Trusts") secured by the Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates ("PHC Certificates") financing facilities ( PHC TOB Trusts ) required approximately $400,000 , and the TOB Trusts secured by mortgage backed securities ("MBS") financing facilities ("MBS TOB Trusts") required approximately $4.1 million held in restricted cash.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P28_S3	There were two of the mortgage payables which required approximately $2.9 million held as restricted cash in 2012 which was released in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P29_S0	Investment in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Other Mortgage Revenue Bonds The Company accounts for its investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other mortgage revenue bonds under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P29_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P29_S2	All of the Company's investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P29_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P30_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P30_S1	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P30_S2	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P30_S3	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P30_S4	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Company evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P32_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P33_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P33_S1	The ability to recover the securities' entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P34_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serve as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P34_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property that serves as collateral on the bond and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P34_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P34_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P35_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P36_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P37_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P37_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 6.25% and 7.25% which the Company believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for multifamily properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P38_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P39_S0	Operating results from a multifamily residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P40_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of and demand for apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P40_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P40_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, the Company believes that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S4	The difference between the amortized cost basis and the discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate represents the credit loss.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P41_S5	Any residual decline in value would be considered the interest related loss or non-credit loss.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P42_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P43_S0	If the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P44_S0	The Company owns some mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P44_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in investment income in the current period.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Company eliminates the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P46_S0	When the Partnership invests in a mortgage revenue bond which is collateralized by a multifamily property, the Partnership will evaluate the entity which owns the property financed by the mortgage revenue bond to determine if it is a VIE as defined by the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P47_S0	The guidance on consolidations is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P47_S1	If it is determined that the entity is a VIE, the Partnership will then evaluate if it is the primary beneficiary of such VIE, by determining whether the Partnership will absorb the majority of the VIE's expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE's residual returns, or both.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P47_S2	If the Partnership determines itself to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the assets, liabilities and financial results of the related multifamily property will be consolidated in the Partnership's financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P47_S3	As a result of such consolidation, the debt financing provided by the Partnership to such consolidated VIE will be eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P47_S4	However, the Partnership will continue to receive interest and principal payments on such debt and these payments will retain their characterization as either mortgage revenue bond or taxable interest for income tax reporting purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P48_S0	Since the Partnership has no legal ownership of the VIEs, creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P49_S0	Effective December 1, 2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity, a reconsideration event.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P49_S1	As a result of the change in ownership, Lake Forest ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P50_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates and MBS under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P50_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P50_S2	All of the Company's PHC Certificates and MBS investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P50_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P51_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available and the estimates of the fair values of the PHC Certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P52_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P53_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P54_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P55_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P55_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S3	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company's intend and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S4	Each MBS security has been rated either "AAA" or "AA" by either S P or Moody's.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P56_S5	A downgrade in rating for each MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody's below the "A" rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other-than-temporary.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P57_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company's investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P57_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19 - 40 years on multifamily residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P57_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P58_S0	Management reviews each property for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P58_S1	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P59_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P60_S0	Taxable Property Loans In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, taxable property loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P60_S1	The repayment of these taxable property loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralize the loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P60_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralize the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any taxable property loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow ("DCF") models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P61_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Company may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P62_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P62_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P63_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P63_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011, the Company recognized a provision for loan losses of approximately $168,000 and $4.2 million , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P63_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not recognize any provision for loan losses.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P64_S0	Accounting for Tax Exempt Bond Securitization ("TEBS") and Tender Option Bond ("TOB") Financing Arrangements The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (Note 11) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transactions.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P64_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P64_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P65_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P65_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P65_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P66_S0	The TEBS financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P66_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P66_S2	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P66_S3	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the TEBS financing being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P66_S4	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the tender option bond trusts ("TOB Trusts") through their ownership of the residual participating interests ("LIFERS") so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company's consolidated financial statements as secured financings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P67_S0	In addition to evaluating the TEBS financing as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trust associated with the TEBS financing facility (the TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P67_S1	As part of the TEBS Financing, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the TEBS Trust with Freddie Mac.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P67_S2	The TEBS Trust then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P68_S0	Other Company investments are securitized into TOB Trusts with Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P69_S0	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests ("SPEARS") and LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P70_S0	The Partnership has determined that the TEBS Trust is a VIE and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the TEBS Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P70_S1	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are VIEs and the LIFERS owned by the Company create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P71_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the TEBS Trust and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the TEBS financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P72_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the TEBS Trust because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE's management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P72_S2	While in the TEBS Trust, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trust and the liabilities of the trust do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P73_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P73_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P74_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P74_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the TEBS financing facility and the associated TEBS Trust are presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P74_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P75_S0	The bond purchase commitments held by the Company have no cost.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P75_S1	However, they are required to be measured and recorded at fair value, which is estimated under the same methodology as the Company's mortgage revenue bonds in the Company's financial statements (Notes 5 and 17).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P76_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P76_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P76_S2	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $5.3 million and $4.6 million , respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P76_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of approximately $2.8 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P77_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership's taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P77_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P77_S2	At December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P77_S3	The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $7.4 million and $10.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively, against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S1	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S2	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S3	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond's ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S6	Past due contingent interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P78_S7	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , the Company's mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest with the exception of the Woodland Park bond in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P79_S0	An evaluation was performed during fiscal 2011 which determined that the interest receivable accrued on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P79_S1	The Partnership received two interest payments during 2012 and recorded an additional allowance of approximately $453,000 against the remaining interest receivable in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P79_S2	The Partnership recorded an approximate additional $242,000 against the interest receivable before the mortgage revenue bond foreclosure was completed in May 2013 and title to the Woodland Park property was conveyed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership (Note 8).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P80_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates The Partnership's Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (Note 8) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P81_S0	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P82_S0	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned (Notes 6 and 7).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P83_S1	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P84_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Company's interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P84_S2	The Company is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P84_S3	The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P85_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P86_S0	Net Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P86_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P86_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per BUC holder:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P87_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P87_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P87_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P88_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P88_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of such date.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P88_S3	For purposes of the Agreement of Limited Partnership, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (Note 8) will be included in the Partnership's Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P89_S0	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P89_S1	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage revenue bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P90_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs as of the date of the implementation of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P90_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs' net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P91_S0	The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 were as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P92_S0	Although each multifamily property financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P92_S1	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P93_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership determined that four of the entities financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P93_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, and Fairmont Oaks.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P93_S2	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two of these VIEs; Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P93_S3	Effective December 1, 2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity and Lake Forest ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P94_S0	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership determined that five of the entities financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P94_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks and Lake Forest.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P94_S2	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of three of these VIEs; Bent Tree, Fairmont Oaks, and Lake Forest and has continued to consolidate these entities during 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P94_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership also determined that the Exchange Accommodation Titleholder ("EAT (Maples on 97th)") was also a VIE based on the Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement and Master Lease Agreement between the Partnership and EAT (Maples on 97th).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P94_S4	In February 2013, title to the Maples on 97th property transferred to the Partnership from the EAT (Maples on 97th) and the property is reported as an MF Property as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P95_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in the four VIEs and therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P96_S0	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with the four VIEs financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership relate to the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily apartment property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P97_S0	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P98_S0	At December 31, 2013 , the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P99_S0	The capital structure of Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs consists of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P99_S1	The senior debt is in the form of a mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the VIEs' total capital.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P99_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P100_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by four individuals, three of which are related parties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P100_S1	Additionally, each of these properties is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, America First Properties Management Company, LLC ( Properties Management ) which is an affiliate of the Burlington Capital Group, LLC ("Burlington").
1059142_14_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Partnership lent the EAT (Maples on 97th) the necessary funds to purchase the Maples on 97th property and executed a Master Lease Agreement and Construction Management Agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P101_S1	These two agreements gave the Partnership the rights and obligations to manage the replacement property as well as the rehabilitation during the six month hold period.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P101_S2	The Partnership determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the EAT (Maples on 97th).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P101_S3	Based on the terms of the Master Lease Agreement, the Partnership reported the rental income and related real estate operating expenses for the Maples on 97th property during the six month holding period (August 2012 to January 2013) as an MF Property since it has all the rights and obligations of landlord for the property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P101_S4	In February 2013, title to the Maples on 97th property transferred to the Partnership from the EAT (Maples on 97th).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P102_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Partnership also considered the related party relationships of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P102_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company does not consolidate two VIE entities, Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P104_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of each VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P104_S1	The significant activities of the VIE that impact the economic performance of the entity include leasing and maintaining apartments, determining if the property is to be sold, decisions relating to debt refinancing, the selection of or replacement of the property manager and the approval of the operating and capital budgets.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P104_S2	As discussed below, while the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P105_S0	Ashley Square - Ashley Square Housing Cooperative acquired the ownership of the Ashley Square apartments in December 2008 from Ashley Square LLC through a warranty deed of transfer and an assumption of debt.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P105_S1	This transfer of ownership constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P106_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P106_S1	The senior debt is in the form of mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P106_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P107_S0	The VIE is organized as a housing cooperative and the 99% equity owner of this VIE is The Foundation for Affordable Housing ( FAH ), an unaffiliated Nebraska non-profit organization.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P107_S1	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P108_S0	Cross Creek - Cross Creek Apartments Holdings LLC is the owner of the Cross Creek Apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P108_S1	On January 1, 2010, Cross Creek Apartment Holdings LLC entered into a new operating agreement and admitted three new members.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P108_S2	These new members committed approximately $2.2 million of capital, payable in three installments including $563,000 on January 1, 2010.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P108_S3	The new operating agreement and admission of new owner members constitutes a reconsideration event as outlined in the consolidation guidance which triggers a re-evaluation of the holders of variable interests to determine the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P109_S0	The capital structure of the VIE consists of senior debt, subordinated loans and equity capital at risk.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P109_S1	The senior debt is in the form of mortgage revenue bonds that are 100% owned by the Partnership and account for the majority of the VIE's total capital.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P109_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P110_S0	The three newly admitted members of this VIE are each unaffiliated with the Partnership and have contributed significant equity capital to the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P110_S1	These members collectively control a 99% interest in the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P110_S2	The other 1% member of this VIE is FAH, which is also unaffiliated with the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P110_S3	Additionally, this property is managed by Properties Management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P111_S0	The following table presents information regarding the carrying value and classification of the assets held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , which constitute a variable interest in Ashley Square and Cross Creek.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P112_S0	The following tables provide information about the two VIEs at December 31, 2013 and the three VIEs at December 31, 2012 in the Partnership's financial statements under the provisions of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P112_S1	These schedules also include information on the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership which are eliminated in consolidation, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P112_S2	In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds detailed below, the Partnership has made taxable property loans to these consolidated VIEs of $7.1 million and $10.6 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P113_S0	The following tables present the effects of the consolidation of the VIEs on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P114_S0	As discussed above, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P114_S1	The cash flows from the VIEs do not represent cash flows available to the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P115_S0	Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 :
1059142_14_ITEM8_P116_S0	Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 :
1059142_14_ITEM8_P117_S0	Each of the mortgage revenue bonds were issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P117_S1	However, the mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P117_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P117_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P117_S4	Each mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and bears interest at a fixed rate and four of the mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P118_S0	The mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Company have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P118_S1	The carrying value of each of the Partnership's mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P119_S0	As all of the Company's investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P119_S1	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P119_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P120_S0	As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , all of the Company's mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P121_S0	Management's valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S0	The key assumption in management's yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S1	At December 31, 2013 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 6.3% to 9.8% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 6.9% to 10.8% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $22.1 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P122_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and management's analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on these mortgage revenue bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , two bonds, Woodlynn Village and Vantage at Judson, have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S2	The Company has reviewed each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S3	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on these two bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S4	If yields on new issuance of tax-exempt investments increase, the Company experiences deterioration in the estimated fair values of its investment portfolio, or if the Company's intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company's financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P123_S5	The Company has the intent and ability to hold both of these mortgage revenue bonds until their stated maturity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P124_S0	The Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Avistar at the Oaks, Avistar in 09, Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar on the Hills, The Suites on Paseo, Copper Gate, Renaissance, The Palms at Premier Park, Tyler Park Apartments, Vantage at Harlingen, and Westside Village Market mortgage revenue bonds were purchased in 2013 so they have been in unrealized loss positions for less than twelve months.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P124_S1	The Greens Property A mortgage revenue bond has been reported due to the realized sale of the Greens Property in 2013, so reports an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months (Note 10).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P124_S2	As the Lake Forest VIE was deconsolidated in 2013, the mortgage revenue bond reports an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months in 2013 (Note 4).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P124_S3	In addition, Autumn Pines, Bella Vista, Bridle Ridge and Runnymede mortgage revenue bonds report unrealized losses for less than twelve months.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P125_S0	The Company's ability to recover the mortgage revenue bonds' entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P126_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P150_S1	The mortgage revenue bond carried an annual interest rate of 7.98% per annum and matures on April 1, 2026 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P150_S2	The bond did not provide for contingent interest.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P151_S0	In conjunction with the purchase of the Arbors of Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond, an affiliate of the Global Ministries Foundation, a not-for-profit entity unrelated to the Company acquired the multi-family property securing the bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P151_S1	At closing, the Company also secured a $600,000 promissory note receivable as a fee for identifying this property acquisition and performing the related due diligence.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P152_S0	In December 2012, the mortgage revenue bond secured by Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments was restructured to an $11.5 million par value mortgage revenue bond with an annual interest rate of 6.25% per annum and maturity of December 1, 2049 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P152_S1	The Partnership then purchased 100% of this bond issuance plus a taxable loan of approximately $191,000 for a payment of approximately $1.0 million made at closing.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P153_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Greens Property were acquired by the Company at par and consisted of two series.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P153_S2	The Series A bond has a par value of approximately $8.5 million and bears interest at an annual rate of 6.5% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P153_S3	The Series B bond has a par value of approximately $1.0 million and bears interest at an annual interest rate of 12.0% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P153_S4	Both series of bonds mature on October 1, 2047 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P154_S0	In connection with the bond financing transaction, ownership of the Greens Property was conveyed by the Company to a new ownership entity controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P154_S1	However, because the new ownership entity did not have sufficient equity capital at the time of purchase and the property operations are the sole source of debt service on the Company's bonds, the Company is required to continue to account for the Greens Property as if it is the owner of real estate rather than as a secured lender.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P154_S2	As such, the Company continues to report the results from the Greens Property as discontinued operations in its financial statements as of December 31, 2012 which, among other things, results in the elimination of the bonds in consolidation (Note 10).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S0	In May 2012, the mortgage revenue bonds secured by GMF-Madison Tower Apartments and GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments were sold for an amount greater than the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S2	These mortgage revenue bonds had been acquired at par on June 1, 2011 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S3	At December 31, 2012, the Partnership still owns the taxable revenue bonds secured by these two properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S4	The taxable bond secured by GMF-Madison Tower Apartments carries an annual interest rate of 7.75% per annum and matures on December 1, 2019 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S5	The taxable bond secured by GMF-Warren/Tulane Apartments carries an annual interest rate of 6.5% per annum and matures on December 1, 2015 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P155_S6	These taxable bonds were also acquired on June 1, 2011 and have an outstanding combined principal balance of $600,000 as of December 31, 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P156_S0	The properties securing the Company's mortgage revenue bonds are geographically dispersed throughout the United States with significant concentration in San Antonio, Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P156_S1	As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the concentration in San Antonio, Texas, as a percentage of principal outstanding, was approximately 30% and 17% .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P156_S2	The Suites on Paseo property in San Diego, California represents 12% of the outstanding principal of the mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P157_S0	Descriptions of certain terms of the mortgage revenue bonds are as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased 100% of the LIFERs in the PHC TOB Trusts which acquired approximately $65.3 million of PHC Certificates issued by three trusts ("PHC Trusts") sponsored by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S1	The assets held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S3	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities' respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S4	The loans payable by the public housing authorities are not debts, nor guaranteed by the United States of America or HUD.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S5	Interest payable on the public housing authority debt held by the PHC Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P158_S6	The PHC Certificates issued by each of the PHC Trusts have been rated investment grade by Standard Poor's.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P159_S0	The Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P159_S1	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P159_S2	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P159_S3	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after preferred return payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P160_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P161_S0	The Company determined that the three PHC TOB trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of the three PHC TOB trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P161_S1	As a result, the Company reports the PHC TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P162_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P163_S0	The indenture for the PHC TOB trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the PHC TOB trusts to sell the PHC Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P163_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the PHC Certificates' fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company had the following investments in the PHC Certificates on December 31, 2013 and 2012:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P165_S0	Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P165_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P165_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates is based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants which includes adjustments for the fact that the PHC Certificates investment grade rating is below "AAA".
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management's estimates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S1	The PHC Certificates are "AA" and "BBB" rated and the range of effective yields was 4.2% to 5.4% per annum at December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC Certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structure security.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S3	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC Certificates would increase to a range of 5.8% to 7.2% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.9 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S7	The PHC Certificates have been in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months and management has concluded that there is no other-than-temporary impairment to record as the Company has the intent and ability to hold on to PHC Certificates until either the estimated fair value rebounds or until maturity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S8	In addition, the most recent update on the annual appropriations from HUD disclosed no significant changes in the program which means the underlying performance of the PHC Certificates will be in line with expectations until the next annual update.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P166_S9	In addition, there have been no downgrades in the investment grade rating of any of the three PHC Certificates noted since the investment was originally acquired in July 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P167_S0	The following table sets forth certain information relating to the PHC Certificates held in the PHC TOB Trusts:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P168_S0	Between November 2012 and April 2013, the Company executed six securitizations of MBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P168_S1	The Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the six MBS TOB Trusts for approximately $9.2 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P169_S0	Each of the six MBS TOB Trusts issued SPEARS to unaffiliated investors; these SPEARS totaled approximately $34.9 million at issuance.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P169_S1	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts, have been credit enhanced by DB and are recorded as debt financing in the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P169_S2	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the MBS TOB Trust on the securitized MBS after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P170_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ("SIFMA").
1059142_14_ITEM8_P171_S0	The Company determined that the six MBS TOB Trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of them.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P171_S1	As a result, the Company reports the MBS TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P172_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P173_S0	The indenture for the MBS TOB Trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the MBS TOB Trusts to sell the MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P173_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the MBS TOB Trusts will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the MBS' fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P173_S2	Interest earned on the MBS held by the six MBS TOB Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P174_S0	The carrying value of the Company's MBS as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P175_S0	(1) MBS are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P176_S0	(1) MBS are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P177_S0	Valuation - The Company values each MBS based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P177_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P177_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P178_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P178_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P178_S2	At December 31, 2013, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.6% to 5.4% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P178_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P178_S4	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.9% to 5.7% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $1.9 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P179_S0	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P179_S1	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P179_S2	Pricing services and management s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P179_S3	Certain of the MBS have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months and management has concluded that there is no other-than-temporary impairment to record as the Company has the intent and ability to hold on to the MBS until either the estimated fair value rebounds or until maturity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P179_S4	In addition, there have been no downgrades to the investment grade rating levels of the MBS since their original acquisition dates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P180_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and interest payable from the MBS is believed and expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P180_S1	Description of certain terms of the Company's MBS is as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P181_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, the Company has acquired through its various subsidiaries 99% limited partner positions in three limited partnerships and 100% member positions in six limited liability companies that own the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P181_S1	The financial statements of these properties are consolidated with those of the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P181_S2	The general partners of these partnerships are unaffiliated parties and their 1% ownership interest in these limited partnerships is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P181_S3	The Company expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P181_S4	The Company expects to purchase mortgage revenue bonds issued by the new property owners as part of the restructuring.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P182_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in eight entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 1,582 rental units, one is located in Kansas, two are located in Nebraska, one is located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Georgia, and two are located in Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P182_S1	One additional limited partnership, The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL, is currently under construction and is planned to be completed in the fall of 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S0	The Partnership, as sole bondholder, previously directed the bond trustee to file a foreclosure action on the Woodland Park mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S1	On February 28, 2013, the court granted a Summary Judgment in the bond trustee's favor confirming that the mortgage revenue bond is senior to mechanic's liens filed on the property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S2	Subsequently, the court ordered a sale of the Woodland Park property and on April 23, 2013, the Partnership made a bid to purchase the property for the amount of the outstanding principal and interest it is owed.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S3	The Partnership's Motion of Confirmation was approved by the court on May 2, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S4	The bond trustee assigned its right to the property to the Partnership on May 8, 2013 and the Partnership received the Sheriff's deed conveying title to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership on May 29, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S5	Woodland Park became an MF Property at a net asset value of approximately $15.7 million upon conveyance of title.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S6	The Partnership requested the mortgage revenue bond issuer to remove the LURA on the property and the units have been converted to 100% market-rate rents.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P183_S7	The Partnership may convert the property back to a rent restricted property, and seek to place new financing on the property and acquire the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S0	In March 2013, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company executed a 35-year ground lease with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln ( Lessor ) with an annual lease payment of $100 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S1	The leased property will have a mixed-use development consisting of a 1,605 stall parking garage and 475 bed student housing mixed-use project constructed on it.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S2	The Lessor will own the parking garage for which it will contribute approximately $16.7 million to its construction.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S3	The Company will own the student housing mixed-use project, The 50/50 Student Housing at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln ("The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL ") and currently estimates that construction will cost approximately $34.0 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S4	The Company executed a guaranteed maximum price contract with the general contractor for the construction on the mixed-use development.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S5	The Company expects to restructure its ownership of The 50/50 into a mortgage revenue bond holding after the construction is completed (which is estimated as August 1, 2014 ) and when the development has a sufficient history of operating results.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S6	The Company has secured approximately $29.8 million in financing facilities to cover the majority of the construction costs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P184_S7	The Company has borrowed approximately $7.2 million on this facility as of December 31, 2013 (Notes 12 and 17).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P185_S0	In August 2012, the Company closed on the purchase of the Maples on 97 th property, a 258 unit facility located in Omaha, Nebraska, for a purchase price of approximately $5.5 million through the execution of a Qualified Exchange Accommodation Agreement that assigned the right to acquire and own the Maples on 97 th property to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Title Company, ("EAT (Maples on 97th)"), for a period not to exceed six months.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P185_S1	The Company lent the EAT (Maples on 97th) the necessary funds to purchase the replacement property; there was no other capital within that entity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P185_S2	The EAT (Maples on 97th) then executed a Master Lease Agreement and Construction Management Agreement with the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P185_S3	These two agreements gave the Company the rights and obligations to manage the replacement property as well as the rehabilitation during the six month hold period.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P185_S4	During this six month holding period, the Partnership completed the majority of the rehabilitation of the property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P186_S0	At December 31, 2012 the EAT (Maples on 97th) was reported as a VIE.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P186_S1	In February 2013, title to the Maples on 97th property transferred to the Partnership from the EAT (Maples on 97th) and the property is reported as an MF Property as of December 31, 2013 .

1059142_14_ITEM8_P192_S5	Once stabilized as a student housing property, the Partnership will seek to restructure the ownership and capital structure through the sale of the property to a student housing not-for-profit entity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P192_S6	The Partnership anticipates it will then purchase mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of such a restructuring.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P193_S0	The table below shows the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations of the Company as if the Maples on 97th, Eagle Village, Arboretum and Woodland Park properties had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented:

1059142_14_ITEM8_P197_S0	In addition to the MF Properties, the Company consolidates the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs in accordance with the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P197_S1	Although the assets of the VIEs are consolidated, the Company has no ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs other than to the extent they serve as collateral for the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P197_S2	The results of operations of those properties are recorded by the Company in consolidation but any net income or loss from these properties does not accrue to the unitholders or the general partner, but is instead included in "Unallocated deficit of variable interest entities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P198_S0	As discussed in Note 4, as the result of the title transfer of the Maples on 97th property to the Partnership from the EAT and the merger of the entity owning Lake Forest,with a not-for-profit, these two entities are no longer consolidated as Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P199_S0	The Company consolidated the following properties owned by the VIEs in continuing operations as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 :

1059142_14_ITEM8_P201_S1	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable property loans for impairment.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P201_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable property loan values.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property's fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P202_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P202_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P203_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 2 above except the discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was 6.3% to 7.4% .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P203_S1	The Company believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily property could obtain current financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P203_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P203_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principle balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P204_S0	On November 26, 2013, the Company executed a loan agreement with Foundation for Affordable Housing, a not-for-profit borrower, for approximately $1.6 million .

1059142_14_ITEM8_P214_S2	During 2013, the Partnership recorded loan loss reserves equal to the accrued interest on the Ashley Square, Cross Creek, Greens and the Ohio Properties taxable property loans receivable because the Partnership has determined they are not reasonably assured.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P220_S2	As such, there was not sufficient equity invested at closing by the not-for-profit or BC Partners into the Ohio Properties to allow the Company to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P220_S5	The sale of this discontinued operation allowed the Company to begin reporting the mortgage revenue bonds related to the Ohio Properties as assets beginning with the March 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P221_S0	The deposit method of accounting for real estate sales required both the deferral of the gain from the real estate sale and also did not allow recognition of the interest payments by the Ohio Properties to the Company between June 2010 and the date of the equity contribution by BC Partners.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P222_S3	The $961,000 BC Partners equity contribution made into this limited partnership in October 2012 was not sufficient to allow the Company to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P222_S4	In July 2013, BC Partners made their required $800,000 capital contribution into the Greens Property as construction was 75% complete.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P224_S2	The deposit method of accounting for real estate sales required both the deferral of the gain from the real estate sale and also did not allow recognition of the interest payments by the Greens Property to the Company between October 2012 and the July 2013, the date of the second equity contribution by BC Partners.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P250_S0	The securitization of these mortgage revenue bonds occurred through two classes of certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P250_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P250_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P251_S0	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain credit, facility, remarketing and servicing fees (the Facility Fees ).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P251_S1	As of December 31, 2013 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.10% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of 2.00% per annum on the outstanding balance on the TEBS financing facility of $93.0 million .

1059142_14_ITEM8_P252_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P259_S0	The Partnership expects each of the MF Properties to eventually be sold either to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P259_S1	The proceeds from such sale will be utilized to retire any associated outstanding mortgage loan.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P259_S2	Should a mortgage loan reach maturity prior to a sale of the associated MF Property, the Partnership would either seek to refinance such mortgage loan or utilize cash reserves to retire the loan.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P259_S3	The Partnership expects to provide mortgage revenue bonds as part of an overall plan of financing the acquisition of a MF Property by a new property owner.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , the Partnership paid administrative fees to AFCA 2 of approximately $1.5 million , $948,000 , and $795,000 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S2	In addition to the administrative fees paid directly by the Partnership, AFCA 2 receives administrative fees directly from the owners of properties financed by certain of the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $144,000 , $133,000 , and $160,000 , in 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S4	Additionally, in connection with the sale of Eagle Ridge, the property paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA2 totaling approximately $71,000 in 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S5	Although these third party administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S6	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P263_S7	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P264_S0	AFCA 2 earns mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P264_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P264_S2	During 2013, AFCA 2 earned mortgage placement fees of approximately $2.0 million related to the 2013 mortgage revenue bond and MBS purchases.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P265_S5	These investment placement fees are consistent with the mortgage placement fees that AFCA 2 has earned in connection with the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P265_S6	Investment/mortgage placement fees earned by AFCA 2 totaled approximately $1.2 million , $1.4 million , and $407,000 , in 2013, 2012 , and 2011 , respectively.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P266_S1	These affiliates received approximately $672,000 in the first twelve months of 2013 under the terms of this Agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P267_S0	An affiliate of AFCA 2 acts as a placement advisor to the borrowers under the mortgage revenue bonds at the time they are acquired by the Company.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P267_S1	Any and all advisory fees are paid by the borrower of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P268_S2	For the Consolidated VIEs, these management fees are not Partnership expenses but are recorded by each applicable VIE entity and, accordingly, have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P268_S3	Such fees are paid out of the revenues generated by the properties owned by the Consolidated VIEs prior to the payment of any interest on the mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Partnership on these properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P268_S4	For the MF Properties, these management fees are considered real estate operating expenses.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P269_S0	The owners of two limited-purpose corporations which own apartment properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds and taxable loans held by the Company are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Company and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P270_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company has four derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing and mortgages payable.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P270_S1	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S0	On July 30, 2013, the Company purchased a new interest rate derivative with a notional amount of $93.3 million which represents the amount outstanding on the TEBS Financing facility at August 1, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S1	The maturity date of this interest rate derivative is September 1, 2017 and the effective capped interest rate is 1.5% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S2	On July 30, 2013, the Company also sold a new interest rate derivative to the same counterparty which had the same notional amount of $93.3 million and an effective capped interest rate of 3.0% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S3	The total cost of these two interest rate derivatives was approximately $800,000 and the derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, therefore, changes in the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives are included in earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S4	This interest rate corridor transaction effectively reduced the capped interest rate from 3.0% to 1.5% per annum on the TEBS Financing facility through the maturity date of the interest rate derivative contracts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S5	In August 2013, the Company executed a master netting agreement with DB, which is the counterparty to these interest rate derivative contracts and is also the provider of the Company's TOB financing facilities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S6	The Company was refunded $500,000 of posted cash collateral on the TOB financing facilities back upon the execution of this master netting agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P271_S7	There are no amounts reported on a net basis related to the Company's interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2013 or 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P272_S0	The Company had previously entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the TEBS financing facility to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P272_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the TEBS financing facility of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P272_S2	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P272_S3	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $284,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , as compared to an increase of approximately $900,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P273_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P273_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $888,000 and $379,000 as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P274_S0	Existing fair value guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P274_S1	The guidance on fair value measurements:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P275_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P276_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P277_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P277_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P278_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P279_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P280_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P281_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P282_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P283_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P283_S1	The fair values of the Company's investments in mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P284_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P284_S1	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P284_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P284_S3	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P285_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P285_S1	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P285_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P285_S3	The approximately $4.9 million estimated fair market value adjustment - mortgage bond purchase commitment liability is also categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P285_S4	This unrealized loss was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P286_S0	Investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P286_S1	The fair value of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P286_S2	There is no active trading market for the trusts' certificates owned by the Company but the General Partner will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P286_S3	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts' certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P286_S4	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P287_S0	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with similar length of terms.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P287_S1	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P288_S0	The fair value of the Company's investment in mortgage-backed securities is based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P288_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company's third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P288_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P289_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P289_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P289_S2	Given these facts, the fair value measurements of the Company's investment in mortgage-backed securities is categorized as Level 2 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P290_S0	The fair values of the Company s investments in taxable bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P290_S1	There is no active trading market for the taxable bonds and price quotes are not available.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P291_S0	The estimates of the fair values of these taxable bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P291_S1	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P292_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in taxable bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P292_S1	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of the taxable bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P292_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in taxable bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P293_S0	The effect of the Company's interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Company's variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P293_S1	The effect of the Company's interest rate swap is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P293_S2	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P293_S3	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P294_S0	Assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_14_ITEM8_P295_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P296_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value given the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P296_S1	The Company calculates a fair market value of each financial instrument using a discounted cash flow model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P296_S2	The estimated fair value of the Debt financing and Mortgages payable are in the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P296_S3	Below represents the fair market value of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P297_S0	The Company, from time to time, may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P297_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P298_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P298_S1	While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P299_S0	Certain of the MF Properties own apartment properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P299_S1	In connection with the acquisition of partnership interests in these partnerships by subsidiaries of the Company, the Company has agreed to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to recapture of these tax credits to the extent the recapture liability is due to the operation of the properties in a manner inconsistent with the laws and regulations relating to such tax credits after the date of acquisition.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P299_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because management believes that the likelihood of any payments being required there under is remote.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P300_S0	The Company provided a guarantee on the $2.8 million mortgage obtained on the Abbington at Stones River, a 96 unit multifamily property located in Tennessee in addition to providing an approximately $1.6 million taxable property loan to Foundation for Affordable Housing, the not-for-profit owner of the property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P300_S1	Based on the historical financial performance of the property and its estimated fair value, the Company estimates there is no value to record for this mortgage guarantee.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P301_S0	In connection with the sale of the Greens Property, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of the Greens of Pine Glen limited partnership, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P301_S1	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P301_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P301_S3	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2013, under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $1.3 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners to date.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P302_S0	In connection with the Ohio Properties transaction in 2011, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.

1059142_14_ITEM8_P303_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur, 25% of the BC equity would remain in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed in Note 9.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P303_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P303_S3	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2013, under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $4.9 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S0	In March 2013, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company executed a 35-year ground lease with the University of Nebraska - Lincoln ( Lessor ) with an annual lease payment of $100 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S1	The leased property will have a mixed-use development consisting of a 1605 stall parking garage and 475 bed student housing mixed-use project constructed on it.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S2	The Lessor will own the parking garage and the Company will own the student housing.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S3	The Company currently estimates the construction of The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project will cost approximately $34.0 million and executed a guaranteed maximum price contract with the general contractor for the construction.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S4	The lease agreement has a stipulation that if the parking garage is not completed by August 1, 2014, the Company will pay damages of $6,000 per day of delayed completion to the Lessor.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S5	The Company's construction contract with the general contractor also stipulates that the general contractor will pay the Company $6,000 per day of liquidated damages for each day subsequent to August 1, 2014 that the parking garage is not completed.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P304_S6	Construction has commenced and is estimated to be completed before the August 1, 2014 deadline.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P305_S0	To finance the construction of The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project, the Company has executed an interest-only loan to borrow up to $25.5 million for a three year term at a variable interest rate.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P305_S1	The Company also secured $4.3 million tax-incremental financing loan which is for a term of five years, carries a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.7% per annum, requires principal payments commencing after 24 months and has a balloon payment due at maturity.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P305_S2	The Company has borrowed approximately $7.2 million on the first facility as of December 31, 2013 (Notes 7 and 11).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P306_S0	In June 2013, the Partnership executed a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase an $8.0 million new mortgage revenue bond and a $500,000 taxable bond both secured by a multifamily property under construction in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P306_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum, the taxable bond will have a stated rate of 12.0% per annum, and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P307_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P307_S1	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership has estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $600,000 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P307_S2	The Partnership has two other Forward Bond Purchase Commitments (Vantage at Judson and Vantage at Harlingen) which are discussed in footnote 5.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P308_S0	The Partnership has also executed a Guarantee Agreement with the construction lender for this Albuquerque project.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P308_S1	The terms of the Guarantee Agreement requires the Partnership to guarantee that all construction costs are paid when due and pay any remaining outstanding principal and unpaid interest on the construction loan on or before July 1, 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P308_S2	Construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015 when the Partnership anticipates purchasing the mortgage revenue bond and taxable bond.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P308_S3	No amounts have been accrued for this Guarantee Agreement as the Partnership expects that the construction loan will be sufficient to pay all costs during the construction period and that the proceeds from the mortgage revenue bond, taxable bond, and third party equity contribution to be sufficient to pay off all outstanding principal and interest on the construction loan on or before July 1, 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P309_S0	As the holder of residual interests issued in connection with its TEBS and TOB bond financing arrangements, the Partnership is required to guarantee certain losses that can be incurred by the trusts created in connection with these financings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P309_S1	These guarantees may result from a downgrade in the investment rating of mortgage revenue bonds held by the trust or of the senior securities issued by the trust, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates beyond pre-set maximums, an inability to re-market the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P309_S2	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P309_S3	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts, the Partnership will be required to fund any such shortfall pursuant to its guarantee.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P310_S0	In February 2014, the Company redeemed the mortgage revenue bond secured by the Villages at Lost Creek property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P310_S1	The bond was redeemed at approximately $18.7 million and the mortgage revenue bond had a carrying value of approximately $15.9 million at time of redemption.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P310_S2	The approximately $2.8 million gain is Tier 2 income with 25% distributable to the General Partner.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P310_S3	Approximately $15.7 million of the proceeds were used to pay down outstanding debt as this mortgage revenue bond was leveraged in the Company s TEBS financing facility.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P311_S0	In February 2014, the Partnership acquired a senior $7.0 million par value and a subordinate $2.3 million par value mortgage revenue bonds secured by Harden Ranch, an 100 unit multifamily apartment complex in Salinas, California.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P311_S1	The senior mortgage revenue bond carries an annual interest rate of 5.75% and matures on March 1, 2031 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P311_S2	The subordinate mortgage revenue bond carries an annual interest rate of 5.50% for the first year and 8.0% for the second year and matures on March 1, 2016 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P312_S0	In February 2014, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements with SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. for a notional amount of $70.0 million with an effective start date of March 1, 2014.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P312_S1	These agreements effectively limits the interest component of the TOB financing correlated with the SIFMA index to a maximum of 1.0% on $70.0 million of the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities and the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities to 1.0% through a three year term ending March 1, 2017 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P312_S2	These interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $390,000 and do not qualify for hedge accounting, therefore, changes in the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives will be included in earnings.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P313_S0	In February 2014, the Company acquired a senior $23 million par value mortgage revenue bond secured by Decatur-Angle Apartments, a 302 unit multifamily apartment complex in Fort Worth, Texas.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P313_S1	The mortgage revenue bond carries an annual interest rate of 5.75% and matures on January 1, 2054 .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P314_S0	On March 7, 2014, the Company executed a new TOB Trust under its credit facility with DB securitizing the Decatur-Angle mortgage revenue bond borrowing $17.25 million .
1059142_14_ITEM8_P314_S1	The facility has a variable interest rate tied to SIFMA and matures in February 2015.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P315_S0	On February 5, 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income , which adds additional disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P315_S1	This ASU was effective in the first interim reporting period in 2013.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P316_S0	The Company consists of five reportable segments, Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS Investments, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P316_S1	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P317_S0	The Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment consists of the Company's portfolio of federally mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of multifamily residential apartments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P317_S1	Such mortgage revenue bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P317_S2	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company held forty mortgage revenue bonds not associated with Consolidated VIEs and two mortgage revenue bonds associated with Consolidated VIEs which are bonds that are eliminated in consolidation on the Company's financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P317_S3	The multifamily apartment properties financed by the 42 mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 5,409 rental units.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P317_S4	Three of the bonds' properties are not operational and are under construction (Note 5).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P318_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily apartment properties which are not currently financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P318_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P318_S2	With the exception of the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property, the Partnership's interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P318_S3	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property are reported as discontinued operations (Note 10).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P319_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in an MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P319_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership's CAD.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P320_S0	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company consolidated the results of eight MF Properties containing a total of 1,582 rental units plus the The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL in Lincoln, Nebraska that is currently under construction (Note 8).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P321_S0	Other Investments The Partnership Agreement authorizes the Company to make investments in investments other than mortgage revenue bonds provided that these other investments are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency and do not constitute more than 25% of the Company's assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P321_S1	In addition, the amount of other investments are limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon for the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P321_S2	The Company currently has other investments, PHC Certificates and MBS which are reported as two separate segments.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P322_S0	The PHC Trusts segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the PHC Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P322_S1	The Partnership consolidates the PHC Trusts due to it's ownership of the LIFERS issued by the three PHC Trusts, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of local public housing authorities.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P322_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the HUD under HUD's Capital Fund Program established under the Capital Fund Program.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P322_S3	This investment has been reported as part of the Partnership balance sheet and results of operations since acquired in July 2012.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P323_S0	The MBS segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the MBS TOB Trusts that the Company consolidated due to its ownership of the LIFERs issued by the MBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P323_S1	These MBS TOB Trusts are securitizations of state-issued mortgage-backed securities which are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P323_S2	These investments were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 through the second quarter of 2013 (Note 7).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P324_S0	Consolidated VIE segment The Consolidated VIE segment consists of multifamily apartment properties which are financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P324_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds on these Consolidated VIE properties are eliminated from the Company's financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds are held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P324_S2	The Company does not actually own an equity position in the Consolidated VIEs or their underlying properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P324_S3	As of December 31, 2013 , the Company consolidated two VIE multifamily apartment properties containing a total of 410 rental units (Note 4).
1059142_14_ITEM8_P325_S0	Management closely monitors and evaluates the financial reporting associated with and the operations of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties and performs such evaluation separately from the other operations of the Partnership through interaction with the affiliated property management company which manages the multifamily apartment properties held by the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P326_S0	Management's goals with respect to the properties constituting the Company's Consolidated VIE and MF Properties reportable segments is to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to (i) make all payments of base interest, and possibly pay contingent interest, on the properties included in the Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment and the Consolidated VIE segment, and (ii) distribute net rental income to the Partnership from the MF Properties segment until such properties can be refinanced with additional mortgage revenue bonds meeting the Partnership's investment criteria.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P326_S1	In order to achieve these goals, management of these multifamily apartment properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of its properties in their respective market areas.
1059142_14_ITEM8_P327_S0	The following table details certain key financial information for the Company's reportable segments for the three years ended December 31:
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Chief Financial Officer of The Burlington Capital Group LLC (in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P1_S1	There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company's management (including officers of the Burlington Capital Group LLC in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of The Burlington Capital Group LLC (in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership), of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company's management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that evaluation, the Company's management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013 .
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P4_S0	To the Partners of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2013 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P5_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting .
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P6_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P6_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P6_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P6_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P7_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P7_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P8_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P8_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P9_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 , based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_14_ITEM9A_P10_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013 , of the Company and our report dated March 7, 2014 , expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

1059142_14_ITEM10_P1_S1	In addition, our shareholders are not entitled to elect the managers or executive officers of Burlington, or take part in the management or control of the business of the Partnership.
1059142_14_ITEM10_P2_S0	The Board of Managers of Burlington has nine members.
1059142_14_ITEM10_P2_S1	The NASDAQ listing rules do not require a listed limited partnership, such as the Partnership, to have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee.
1059142_14_ITEM10_P2_S2	We are, however, required to have an audit committee of at least three members, all of whom are required to meet the independence and experience standards established by the NASDAQ listing rules and SEC rules.

1059142_15_ITEM1_P0_S0	America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties in their market areas.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P0_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest received on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P0_S2	As a result, the Partnership expects most of the income it earns is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P0_S3	See Risk Factors - Shareholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our mortgage revenue bonds is determined to be taxable.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owned 55 mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $424.2 million as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S1	The majority of these bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 35 Residential Properties containing a total of 6,527 rental units located in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S2	Three of the bonds properties located in Texas are not operational and are under construction and two bonds are collateralized by commercial real estate located in Tennessee.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S3	Fifty-three of the mortgage revenue bonds are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on the Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S4	Two mortgage revenue bonds are secured by ground, facility, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S5	Each of the bonds provides for base interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S6	Additionally, four of the bonds also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P1_S7	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide the Partnership with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac and 6 are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) in Tender Option Bond ( TOB ) facilities (see Notes 2 and 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P2_S1	Two of the entities that own the multifamily residential properties financed by two of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds were deemed to be consolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ) of the Partnership at December 31, 2014 and, as a result, these bonds are eliminated in consolidation on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize our mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P6_S0	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P6_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties which collateralize the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P7_S0	The return to the Partnership from its investments in mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize these bonds, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other residential rental properties and commercial properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with its mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P8_S0	The Partnership may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by its Agreement of Limited Partnership dated October 1, 1998, as amended (the Partnership Agreement ) and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P8_S1	Under the Partnership Agreement, these other securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership s assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P8_S2	In addition, the Partnership Agreement requires management to assess and conclude whether the income from these other securities are exempt from inclusion in income for federal taxation purposes at the time of purchase.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership has two other classes of investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts Certificates ( PHC Certificates ) and mortgage-backed securities ( MBS ).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S1	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate principal outstanding of $59.3 million at December 31, 2014 and are securitized into three separate Tender Option Bond financing facilities ( TOB Trusts ) with DB ( PHC Trusts see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S2	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S3	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S4	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P9_S5	The state issued MBS had an aggregate principal outstanding of $14.8 million at December 31, 2014 and have been securitized into three separate TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P10_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and have investment grade ratings by the most recent S P or Moody s rating.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable property loans secured by the Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P11_S1	The Partnership does this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in the best long-term interest of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P12_S0	The Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in bonds issued to finance these properties and which the Partnership expects and believes generate tax-exempt interest.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P12_S1	The Partnership currently holds interests in nine MF Properties containing 2,163 rental units, of which three are located in Nebraska, one is located in Kansas, one is located in Kentucky, one is located in Indiana, one is located in Georgia, and two are located in Texas.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P12_S2	In addition, the Partnership may acquire real estate securing its mortgage revenue bonds or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S0	To restructure each of the MF Properties into a mortgage revenue bond, the Partnership teams with a third party developer who works to secure a mortgage revenue bond issuance from the local housing authority.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S1	Once the developer receives the mortgage revenue bond commitment, the Partnership will sell the MF Property to a not-for-profit entity or to a for profit entity in connection with a syndication of Low Income Housing Tax Credits ( LIHTCs ) under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire the mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S3	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the Partnership s initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S4	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P13_S5	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, the Partnership will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what management believes is its optimal fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P14_S0	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P14_S1	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P15_S0	The Company currently operates in five reportable business segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments; (2) MF Properties; (3) Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts; (4) MBS Investments; and (5) Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P15_S1	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P15_S2	For a disclosure of the revenues, net income and loss, total assets, and certain other key financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 for each of the Company s five reportable segments, see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P16_S0	Nine of the 38 Residential Properties which collateralize the bonds owned by the Partnership are managed by America First Properties Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership s general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 ).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P16_S1	In this regards, Properties Management provides property management services for Ashley Square, Bent Tree Apartments, Lake Forest Apartments, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Cross Creek, Greens of Pine Glen, (the Greens Property ) Crescent Village, Willow Bend and Post Woods (collectively, the Ohio Properties ), and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P16_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to the Partnership and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC relating to these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P17_S0	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital, (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our shareholders which we expect and believe are substantially exempt from federal income tax, and (iii) generate additional returns from appreciation of real estate or the opportunistic sale of the asset investments.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P17_S1	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily and student residential properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P17_S2	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed multifamily residential properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P17_S3	The Partnership expects and believes that any contingent interest it receives will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our shareholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P18_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by the Partnership Agreement, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P18_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our current operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage which will not exceed 65% of the total Partnership assets.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P19_S0	The assets are defined as the par value of the mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties at cost (see the discussion of financing arrangements and liquidity and capital resources in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P20_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P20_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P21_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected mortgage revenue bonds that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P21_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required which, if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle the Partnership to receive payment of contingent interest on its bond investment.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P21_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P21_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P21_S4	We may also be able to use a higher-quality investment portfolio to obtain higher leverage to be used to acquire additional investments.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P22_S0	If the sale results in Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), it is distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to the General Partner (see Note 2 to the to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P23_S0	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, student housing projects, housing for senior citizens, and commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P23_S1	The four basic types of mortgage revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM1_P24_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P24_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with mortgage revenue bonds that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P24_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the multifamily residential project may be rented at market rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P25_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P25_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds that were secured by Residential Properties issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P25_S2	There are no Treasury Regulations related to the mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by the commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P26_S0	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed multifamily residential project.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P26_S1	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P26_S2	We expect to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P26_S3	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P27_S0	The Partnership invests in mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P27_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P27_S2	Four of the mortgage revenue bonds currently owned by the Partnership also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying multifamily residential properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P27_S3	As a result, the amount of interest earned by the Partnership from its investment in mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P28_S0	Net operating income from a residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P28_S1	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Partnership may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P29_S1	These securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of the Partnership s assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P30_S0	Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P30_S1	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P30_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P30_S3	The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P30_S4	The PHC Certificates rating by Standard Poor s is investment grade as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P31_S0	The Partnership also invests in state-issued MBS that are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P31_S1	These MBS are rated investment grade by Standard Poor s or Moody s as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P32_S0	The Partnership may also make taxable property loans secured by Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds that are held by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S0	As part of its growth strategy, the Partnership may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to position itself for a future investment in mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such MF Properties by a new owner.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S1	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new mortgage revenue bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S2	The Partnership may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S3	After the LIHTC compliance period, the Partnership would expect to sell its interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek mortgage revenue bond financing on the MF Property which the Partnership could acquire.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S4	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of the acquisition by the Partnership of an interest in an MF Property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S5	The Partnership will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P33_S6	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, the Partnership will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what management believes is its optimal fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P34_S0	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P34_S1	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for the Partnership and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P35_S0	There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential housing in the United States.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P35_S1	The HUD reports that there is a high demand for quality affordable housing.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P35_S2	The types of mortgage revenue bonds in which the Company invests offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P35_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P36_S0	The demand for affordable housing by qualified potential residents whose income does not exceed 50-60% of the area median income continues to increase.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P36_S1	Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents has not kept up with the demand, therefore programs that support private sector development and support for affordable housing through mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits and grant funding to developers have become more prominent.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P37_S0	In addition to mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P37_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with mortgage revenue bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P37_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P37_S3	The Partnership does not invest in LIHTCs, but is attracted to mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and; therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P38_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P38_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P38_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S0	Economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S4	The national economic conditions including sluggish job growth and low home mortgage interest rates may also have a negative effect on some of the Residential Properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S5	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the year) will result in lower economic occupancy.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S6	The overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the stabilized Residential Properties that the Partnership has financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 91% during 2014 and 90% during 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P39_S7	The economic occupancy of the stabilized MF Properties has increased to approximately 86% during 2014 as compared to 82% during 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P40_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional shares or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P41_S0	The Partnership utilizes leverage to enhance investor returns.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P41_S1	Management uses target constraints for each type of financing utilized by the Partnership to manage an overall 65% leverage constraint.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P41_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P41_S3	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 65%.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P41_S4	The overall leverage constraint of the Partnership, total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the par value of the mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties at cost, is approximately 59%, as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S0	Beginning in 2007, the Partnership has issued BUCs to raise additional equity capital to fund investment opportunities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S1	In November 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the Registration Statement ) was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $225 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S2	In December 2013, the Partnership issued an additional 8,280,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $6.25 per BUC pursuant to this new Registration Statement.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S3	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $48.2 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $3.5 million.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S4	In the first quarter of 2014, the Partnership issued an additional 9,200,000 BUCs through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $5.95 per BUC pursuant to this Registration Statement.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P42_S5	Net proceeds realized by the Partnership from this issuance of these BUCs were approximately $51.3 million after payment of an underwriter s discount and other offering costs of approximately $3.5 million.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P43_S0	In October 2014, the Company sold a portion of the MBS TOB Trusts for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P43_S1	The approximate $24.4 million par value of the MBS had been acquired for approximately $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first half of 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P43_S2	The Company then collapsed the related MBS - TOB Trust 4 for approximately $6.0 million, MBS - TOB Trust 5 for approximately $5.3 million and MBS - TOB Trust 6 for approximately $7.8 million securitizing the related MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P43_S3	The Company s approximate $19.1 million TOB financing facilities, which were the securitization of this MBS TOB Trusts, were paid off in full in connection with this sale (see Notes 7 and 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P44_S0	In May 2014, the Company sold a portion of the MBS TOB Trusts for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P44_S1	This approximately $3.7 million par value MBS had been acquired for approximately $3.8 million in November 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P44_S2	The Company s approximate $2.9 million TOB financing facilities, which were the securitization of this MBS TOB Trusts, were paid off in full in connection with this sale (see Notes 7 and 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P45_S0	In April 2014, the mortgage revenue bond secured by Autumn Pines was sold for the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P45_S1	The Company received approximately $13.1 million for the Autumn Pines mortgage revenue bond and recognized a gain of approximately $873,000 after payment of all TOB related financing fees.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P45_S2	This gain was Tier 2 income with approximately $650,000 allocated to the unitholders and approximately $218,000 allocated to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P45_S3	This mortgage revenue bond had been acquired at a discount on June 1, 2011.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P45_S4	The Company s $9.8 million TOB financing facility which was the securitization of this mortgage revenue bond was collapsed and paid off in full in connection with this sale (see Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P46_S0	In February 2014, the mortgage revenue bond secured by Lost Creek was redeemed for an amount greater than the outstanding principal and accrued base interest.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P46_S1	This $18.5 million par value mortgage revenue bond had been acquired for approximately $15.9 million in May 2010.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P46_S2	The Company received approximately $18.7 million for the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond resulting in an approximate $2.8 million realized gain.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P46_S3	This gain was Tier 2 income with approximately $2.1 million allocated to the unitholders and approximately $709,000 allocated to the General Partner (see Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P47_S0	In November 2014, the Partnership acquired six mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P48_S0	The Partnership purchased an approximate $4.7 million par value Series A and an approximate $2.0 million par value Series B mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P48_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are secured by Glenview Apartments, an 88 unit multifamily residential property in Cameron, California.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Partnership purchased an approximate $2.5 million par value Series A and an approximate $1.0 million par value Series B mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P49_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are secured by Montclair Apartments, an 80 unit multifamily residential property in Lemoore, California.

1059142_15_ITEM1_P50_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are secured by Santa Fe Apartments, an 89 unit multifamily residential property in Hesperia, California.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P51_S0	These three Series A mortgage revenue bonds each carry an annual interest rate of 5.75% and mature on December 1, 2031.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P51_S1	The three Series B mortgage revenue bonds each carry an annual cash interest rate of 5.50% for the first year and 8.0% for the second year and mature in December 2016 (see Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM1_P68_S0	In July 2014, a separate transaction occurred as a preliminary transaction to achieve the closing of the Tax Exempt Bond Securitization Financing ( M31 TEBS Financing discussed in the M31 TEBS Financing section in Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P68_S1	DB purchased the SPEARS which securitized four TOB Trust facilities for approximately $45.9 million and approximately $26.5 million in the related residual LIFERS.

1059142_15_ITEM1_P70_S0	In March 2014, the Partnership obtained two $5.0 million unsecured revolving lines of credit.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P70_S1	The first revolving line of credit carries a variable interest rate which was approximately 3.5% on December 31, 2014 and matures in March 2015.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P70_S2	The second revolving line of credit also carries a variable interest rate which was approximately 3.4% on December 31, 2014 and matures in March 2016.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P70_S3	On December 31, 2014 , the Partnership had not borrowed funds on either line of credit.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P70_S4	The lines of credit could be utilized to help with short-term working capital needs and to fund new investments during the periods of time that the Company is working with its lender to finalize new TOB financings of assets (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P71_S0	The Partnership is managed by its general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or the General Partner ) which is controlled by its general partner, the Burlington Capital Group LLC ( Burlington ).
1059142_15_ITEM1_P71_S1	The persons acting as the Board of Managers and executive officers of Burlington act as the directors and executive officers of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P71_S2	Certain services are provided to the Partnership by other employees of Burlington and the Partnership reimburses Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P71_S3	The Partnership is not charged, and does not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P71_S4	As of December 31, 2014, there are no employees of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P72_S0	The Partnership competes with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, and other entities with objectives similar to the Partnership for the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P72_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S0	Because the Partnership holds mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, a commercial property, and holds an interest in the MF Properties, the Partnership may be considered to be in competition with other real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily rental properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S2	Multifamily rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S3	To compete effectively, the multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties financed or owned by the Partnership must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Partnership s Residential Properties and MF Properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P73_S5	These Residential Properties and MF Properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P74_S0	The Partnership believes that each of the MF Properties, the Residential Properties, and the commercial property which provides collateral for its mortgage revenue bonds are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of such properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P75_S0	The Partnership is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, it makes no provision for income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P75_S1	The distributive share of the Partnership s income, deductions and credits is included in each unitholder s income tax return.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P76_S0	The Partnership holds its interests in MF Properties through various subsidiaries which are C corporations for income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P76_S1	These subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P76_S2	Therefore, the Partnership is only subject to income taxes on these investments to the extent it receives dividends from the subsidiaries.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P77_S0	The VIEs which are reported on a consolidated basis with the Partnership for GAAP reporting purposes are separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P77_S1	The Partnership does not presently believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP will impact the Partnership s tax status, amounts reported to shareholders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership s ability to distribute income to shareholders which it believes is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P78_S0	All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, is that of the Partnership and the VIEs on a consolidated basis.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P78_S1	All references to we, us, and the Partnership in this document mean America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P79_S0	As used in this document, the Company refers to the Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and its consolidated variable interest entities.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P80_S0	We are a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P80_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P81_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and real estate properties, including multifamily, student and senior citizen housing.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P82_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P83_S0	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P83_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P84_S0	In connection with the operation of the Partnership, AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments, and taxable property loans held by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P84_S1	Ten of the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership provide for the payment of this administrative fee to the general partner by the owner of the financed property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P84_S2	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P84_S3	Our Partnership Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by the Partnership with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P84_S4	In addition, our Partnership Agreement provides that the Partnership will pay the administrative fee to the general partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P85_S0	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P85_S1	In addition, an affiliate of AFCA 2 acts as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when mortgage revenue bonds and financing facilities are acquired by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P85_S2	Any fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds or by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P85_S3	The amount of fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2, its affiliate, and such property owners.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P86_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P86_S1	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P86_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties financed by additional mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P86_S3	If the Partnership acquires ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P87_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P88_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third party investors.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P88_S1	Because each such outside third party effectively holds a share of the sole limited partner s rights and obligations as a limited partner, BUCs are also referred to herein as shares or units for purposes of calculating amounts per BUC, and the holders thereof are referred to as shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P89_S0	The Partnership s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_15_ITEM1_P89_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P0_S0	The financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the Partnership are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond the Partnership s control.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Cash distributions from the Partnership may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The Partnership currently distributes cash to shareholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S1	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to the Partnership for this purpose.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.40 and $0.42 per unit, respectively, resulting in the remainder of the $0.50 per unit annual distribution being a return of capital to shareholders for both years.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Although the Partnership may supplement its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless the Partnership is able to increase its cash receipts through completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S4	In addition, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to maintain its current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if the Partnership completes its current investment plans.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P2_S5	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P3_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P4_S0	Although our mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying Residential Properties and commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P4_S2	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, except in limited cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P4_S3	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to the kinds of risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P5_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P6_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P6_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, number of patients, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other similar multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential properties, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P7_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our bonds are located, there is significant competition from other apartment complexes and from single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The principal of most of our mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S4	Similarly, if a mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P9_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will suffer a loss.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P10_S0	In the event a property securing a mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or remarketing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P10_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P10_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The taxable property loans that we make to owners of the Residential Properties that secure mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P12_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P13_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable property loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P13_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable property loans than on the associated mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P14_S1	While these taxable property loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, the Partnership does not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable property loan if the property is not in default on the mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P15_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future bond financings of these projects.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P16_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P16_S1	Our plan is to provide mortgage financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S1	For this and other reasons, the Partnership may not be able to sell its interests in the MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S2	In addition, the value of the Partnership s interest in MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S3	As a result, the Partnership may incur a loss upon the sale of its interest in an MF Property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S4	In addition, we may not be able to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P17_S5	During the time the Partnership owns an interest in an MF Property, any net income it receives from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P18_S0	Any future issuances of additional shares could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P19_S0	The Partnership may issue additional shares from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P19_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing shares and a decrease in the market price of the shares.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P19_S2	In addition, if additional shares are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per share basis may decline.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P20_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P21_S1	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with a specific interest rate indices.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P21_S2	All of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to shareholders and may affect the market value of our shares.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P22_S0	The use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P23_S0	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the value of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P23_S1	A decrease in the value of our mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P23_S2	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P24_S0	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds through the issuance of additional shares or from the proceeds from the sale of existing mortgage revenue bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per share basis may be reduced.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P25_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S0	We use derivative instruments, such as interest rate caps, to mitigate the risks we are exposed to as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S1	However, there is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate the Partnership from the interest rate risks to which it is exposed.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S2	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and these costs may not ultimately turn out to exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S3	There is also a risk that a counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S4	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S5	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P26_S6	This can result in significant period to period volatility in the Partnership s reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P27_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and mortgage-backed securities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P28_S0	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our investment assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P28_S2	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable rate.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P28_S3	As the holder of the residual interest, the Partnership is entitled to any remaining interest received by the trust holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents and liquidity providers.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P28_S4	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following:
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P30_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P30_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less interest available to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P30_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, the Partnership s return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and no party guarantees the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Partnership holds a residual interest (known as Class B interests in the TEBS Financing facilities with Freddie Mac and LIFERs in the TOB financing facilities) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P32_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to the Partnership as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P32_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, the Partnership can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P32_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause the Partnership to lose the assets and other collateral it pledged for such financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S0	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S3	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S4	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then the Partnership will be required, through its guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P34_S5	As a result, the Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose its investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P35_S0	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair the Partnership s ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P36_S0	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P36_S1	In that situation, it is possible that the Partnership would not be able to recover the investment assets and other collateral it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by the Partnership in such trust or other entity.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P37_S0	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S1	Tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth combined with continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, restricted availability of credit, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to a slow economic recovery and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S3	Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, providing funding to borrowers.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S4	As a result, our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P38_S5	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P39_S0	Federal regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may require us to unwind our tender option bond financing facilities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P40_S0	On December 10, 2013, U.S. regulators finalized the Volcker Rule adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which limits the ability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain types of covered funds (such as private equity funds and hedge funds) or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading in the U.S.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with certain covered funds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As currently structured, TOB Trusts like those used as part of the Company s TOB financing program with DB, fit within the definition of covered funds and will be affected by the Volcker Rule.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The regulators specifically noted that banks will need to evaluate if TOB Trusts are, in fact, covered funds and if so, whether an exception to the definition is available.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S1	The regulators declined to provide a specific exclusion from the definition of covered funds for TOB financing programs.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S2	The preamble also notes that participation in a TOB transaction is not prohibited per se, but is subject to the same restrictions on other covered funds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S3	The effective date for the Volcker Rule was April 1, 2014, however the rule provides for a phase in period during which time banks need to make good faith efforts to have full compliance with the rule by July 21, 2015.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S4	The Federal Reserve has extended this conformance period until July 21, 2016, and has announced it intends to grant a further extension until July 21, 2017, provided that the interest in the covered fund was established prior to December 31, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S5	At this time, industry participants are working together to modify the structure of TOBs generally so that they qualify for one of the exceptions contained in the Volcker Rule.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P41_S6	Market participants are confident that they will be able to restructure TOBs to permit banks, such as DB, to continue to sponsor TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P42_S0	As discussed elsewhere in this document, the Company had approximately $174.3 million of outstanding debt financing under its TOB program with DB as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P42_S1	If DB terminates its participation in the TOB program, the Company would likely need to find another source of financing to replace the DB TOB financing.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P42_S2	The Company may not, however, be able to secure such replacement financing at all and if it can get replacement financing, such financing may be on terms less favorable than those offered by DB.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P42_S3	Any changes to the Company s TOB financing program with DB required by the Volcker Rule could have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P43_S0	Any downgrade, or perceived potential of a downgrade, of U.S. sovereign credit ratings or the credit ratings of the U.S. Government-sponsored entities (or GSEs) by the various credit rating agencies may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P44_S0	Our TEBS Financing facilities are an integral part of our business strategy and those financings are dependent upon an investment grade rating of Freddie Mac.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P44_S1	If Freddie Mac were downgraded to below investment grade, it would have a negative effect on our ability to finance our bond portfolio on a longer term basis and could negatively impact Cash Available for Distribution and our ability to continue distributions at current levels.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P45_S0	The federal conservatorship of Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The problems faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commencing in 2008 resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant U.S. Government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S. Government in providing liquidity and credit enhancement for mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P47_S0	In 2011, the Obama administration proposed a plan to wind down the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ), and both houses of Congress are considering legislation to reform the GSEs, their functions and their missions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P47_S1	The future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are likely to be reduced (perhaps significantly) and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P47_S2	Alternatively, it is still possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be dissolved entirely or privatized, and, as mentioned above, the U.S. Government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P48_S0	Any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guarantee obligations could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P48_S1	If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to be eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guarantee obligation), our ability to utilize TEBS Financings facilities could be materially and adversely impacted.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P49_S0	Our mortgage revenue bonds are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S0	The majority of our assets consist of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S5	As a result, our ability to sell our mortgage revenue bonds, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P50_S6	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P51_S0	Delay, reduction, or elimination of appropriations from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can result in payment defaults on the Company s investments in PHC Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P52_S0	The Company has acquired interests (known as LIFERS ) in three tender option bond trusts ( PHC TOB Trusts ), which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P52_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P52_S3	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P52_S4	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by the Company from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P53_S0	The Company s investment in PHC Certificates and MBS are made pursuant to the provision of its Partnership Agreement that allows investment in securities that are not mortgage revenue bonds backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and provide what the Company expects and believes to be tax-exempt income.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust or any of the MBS was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee over the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Accordingly, the Partnership would be required to liquidate its LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P54_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Likewise, if the Partnership liquidates the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates or MBS will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result, the Partnership may not be able to divest its position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying the Company s mortgage-backed securities may materially adversely affect our profitability or result in liquidity shortfalls that could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The Company s MBS are secured by pools of mortgages on residential properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P56_S1	In general, the mortgages which collateralize our MBS may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Prepayments on our MBS result when homeowners/mortgagees satisfy (i.e., pay off) the mortgage upon selling or refinancing their mortgaged property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P57_S1	When we acquire a particular MBS, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate which, together with expected coupon income, provides us with an expected yield on such MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P57_S2	If we purchase assets at a premium to par value, and borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will have to amortize the related premium on an accelerated basis.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P57_S3	Conversely, if we purchase assets at a discount to par value, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the MBS may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P58_S0	Prepayment rates on loans are influenced by changes in mortgage and market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P59_S0	In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P59_S1	If general interest rates decline at the same time, the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid (to the extent such assets are available for us to reinvest in).
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, the market value of our MBS may, because of the risk of prepayment, benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P61_S0	All of the Residential Properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P61_S1	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P61_S2	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P61_S3	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P61_S4	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner s ability to service its debt.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P62_S0	The properties financed by certain of our mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P63_S0	Three of the multifamily housing properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are located in areas that are prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P63_S1	The current insurable value of these three properties is approximately $50.1 million.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property s value.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P64_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the five properties financed by the Partnership that are located in areas rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a five percent deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P64_S2	As a result, if any of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property and this could result in a default on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P64_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P65_S0	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P66_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P67_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P67_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P68_S0	If we acquire ownership of Residential Properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P69_S0	We may acquire ownership of Residential Properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P69_S1	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P69_S2	In either case, during the time we own an MF Property, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P69_S3	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates and increases in operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P69_S4	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Partnership s financial results and ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P70_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of Residential Properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P71_S0	We may invest in mortgage revenue bonds secured by residential housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P72_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P72_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P72_S2	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P72_S3	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the mortgage revenue bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable property loan.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S3	Any return on this additional investment would be taxable.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P73_S5	The overall return to the Partnership from its investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P74_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P75_S0	We may acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P75_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P75_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P75_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P75_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P76_S0	We have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P77_S0	The Partnership has acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P77_S1	When the Partnership acquires an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after the Partnership acquired its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P77_S2	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P78_S0	The Partnership is not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P79_S0	The Partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because it operates under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P79_S1	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The Partnership engages in transactions with related parties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as the General Partner to the Partnership and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for some of the Residential Properties that underlie our mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own two of the Residential Properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans held by the Partnership are employees of Burlington who are not involved in the operation or management of the Partnership and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S4	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S5	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm s length.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P81_S6	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Shareholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, or MBS is determined to be taxable.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P83_S0	In each mortgage revenue bond transaction, the governmental issuer, as well as the underlying borrower, has covenanted and agreed to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements necessary to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest earned on the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Failure to comply with such requirements may cause interest on the related issue of bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Should the interest income on a mortgage revenue bond be deemed to be taxable, the bond documents include a variety of rights and remedies that the Partnership has concluded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P84_S1	Under such circumstances, the Partnership would enforce any and all of such rights and remedies as set forth in the related bond documents as well as any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P84_S2	In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any mortgage revenue bond is challenged by the IRS, the Partnership would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and would, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P84_S3	The loss of tax-exemption for any particular issue of bonds would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated issue of bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P84_S4	However, the loss of such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our shareholders of taxable income relating to such bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P85_S0	Certain of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P85_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P85_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P85_S3	If the IRS were to determine that these mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P86_S0	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS into trusts and are entitled to a share of the interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interests on senior securities issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P87_S0	Not all of the income received by the Partnership is exempt from taxation.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P88_S0	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable property loans to the owners of properties which are secured by mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P88_S1	The interest income earned by the Partnership on these mortgage loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P88_S2	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a mortgage revenue bond or a taxable property loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P88_S3	In that case, the taxable income received by the Partnership will be allocated to our shareholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P89_S0	If the Partnership was determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for the Partnership and its shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P90_S0	The Partnership has determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P90_S1	The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for the Partnership and allow us to pass through our interest which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt to our shareholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P90_S2	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P90_S3	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by the Partnership to shareholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of the Partnership s earnings and profits.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P90_S4	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P91_S0	The listing of the Partnership s shares for trading on the NASDAQ causes the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends and certain other items.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S2	The Partnership expects and believes that substantially all of the Partnership s gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on its mortgage revenue bonds, but there can be no assurance that will be the case.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S4	In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, the Partnership will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P92_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P93_S0	To the extent the Partnership generates taxable income; shareholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P94_S0	As a partnership, our shareholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by the Partnership, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P95_S0	There are limits on the ability of our shareholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_15_ITEM1A_P96_S0	The ability of shareholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by the Partnership will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for shareholders who are individuals.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P0_S0	The Partnership conducts its business operations from and maintains its executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Omaha, Nebraska 68102.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P0_S1	This property is owned by Burlington.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P0_S2	The Partnership believes that this property is adequate to meet its business needs for the foreseeable future.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P1_S0	Each of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are collateralized by affordable multifamily and student housing properties (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P1_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P2_S0	As a result of the guidance on consolidations, the Company is required to consolidate certain of the Residential Properties securing its bonds because the owners of those properties are treated as Consolidated VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P2_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company consolidated two multifamily housing properties owned by VIEs located in Florida and South Carolina.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P2_S2	The Partnership does not hold title to the properties owned by the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P3_S0	In addition to the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs, the Company reports the financial results of the MF Properties on a consolidated basis due to the limited partnership interests held by its subsidiary in the partnerships that own the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM2_P3_S1	The Company consolidated nine MF Properties located in Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM2_P4_S0	The following table sets forth certain information for each of the consolidated properties as of December 31, 2014 :
1059142_15_ITEM3_P0_S0	The Partnership is periodically involved in ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business, including foreclosure actions relating to properties securing mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM3_P0_S1	In our judgment, there are no material pending legal proceedings to which the Partnership is a party or to which any of the properties which collateralize the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are subject the resolution of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P0_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P0_S1	The rights and obligations of shareholders are set forth in the Partnership Agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P1_S0	BUCs of the Partnership trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATAX .
1059142_15_ITEM5_P1_S1	The following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for the BUCs for each quarterly period from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM5_P2_S0	The approximate number of unitholders on December 31, 2014 and 2013 was 11,900 and 12,700, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P3_S0	Distributions to shareholders were made on a quarterly basis during 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 .
1059142_15_ITEM5_P3_S1	Total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were approximately $31,339,000, $23,118,000, and $20,643,000, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P4_S0	(d) The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM5_P5_S0	See Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for information regarding the sources of funds that will be used for cash distributions and for a discussion of factors which may adversely affect the Partnership s ability to make cash distributions at the same levels in 2015 and thereafter.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P6_S0	The Partnership did not sell any of its securities during the past three years which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1059142_15_ITEM5_P7_S0	(f) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P0_S0	Set forth below is selected financial data for the Company as of and for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM6_P0_S1	The information should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto filed in response to Item 8 of this report.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P0_S2	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and its effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K:
1059142_15_ITEM6_P1_S0	Please refer to the discussions in Item 1 and Item 7 regarding the implementation of guidance on consolidations and it s effects on the presentation of financial data in this report on Form10-K (continued):
1059142_15_ITEM6_P2_S0	(1) To calculate CAD, amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, Tier 2 income due to the general partner (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), interest rate derivative income or expense (including adjustments to fair value), provision for loan losses, provision for loss on receivables, impairments on assets, deferred gain and related interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to consolidated VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to the Company s net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P3_S0	The Company uses CAD as a supplemental measurement of its ability to pay distributions.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P3_S1	The Company believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P4_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of cash available for distribution or CAD as a means to determine the Partnership s ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P4_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership s operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P5_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P6_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P6_S1	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P7_S0	The following sets forth a reconciliation of the Company s net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and the Partnership s CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P8_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the shareholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P8_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P9_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company realized the sale of the Autumn Pines bond which resulted in an approximate $873,000 gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $218,000, realized the redemption of the Lost Creek bond which resulted in an approximate $2.8 million gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $709,000, and received contingent interest from Ashley Square generating $10,000 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P10_S1	The Company determined that the approximate $1.8 million gain from the sale of Crescent Village, Willow Bend, and Post Woods, (collectively, the Ohio Properties ) was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P10_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P11_S0	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P12_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Tier 2 income is approximately $445K recognized on the Briarwood mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308K of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P13_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the deferred gain on the sale of the Ohio Properties generated approximately $1.8 million and contingent interest generated approximately $33K of Tier 2 income.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P14_S0	(2) The developer income amount represents cash received by the Partnership for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P14_S1	The development at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P14_S2	For purposes of CAD, management is treating these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S0	(3) The Partnership sold the Greens of Pine Glen (the Greens Property ) in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S1	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S2	For this reason, the General Partner concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S3	(4) In July 2013, the Company recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S4	The Company was required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer to the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S5	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by the Partnership between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S6	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM6_P15_S7	(5) The recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties allowed the Company to 1) realize approximately $4.2 million of interest income on the mortgage revenue bonds, 2) recognize approximately $1.1 million of taxable interest income on taxable property loans receivable it holds with the Ohio Properties, and 3) realize a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner owner of the Ohio Properties all in 2013 (see Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM6_P16_S0	Mortgage interest income of $3.5 million of the $4.2 million had been previously received by the Partnership and reported in CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the 2013 CAD calculation.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P15_S4	The slight decrease in revenue and income from continuing operations when comparing 2014 to 2013 is related to the principle paid down year over year.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P15_S5	The increase in revenue, interest expense, and income from continuing operations when comparing 2013 and 2012 can be attributed to only a partial year of investment ownership in 2012 (see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P16_S0	The third class of security owned by the Company is MBS.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P17_S4	The slight decrease when comparing 2014 to 2013 is directly related to the sale of the MBS securities during 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P17_S5	The increase in revenue, interest expense, and income from continuing operations when comparing 2013 to 2012 can be attributed to only a partial year of investment ownership in 2012 (see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P18_S0	To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties, the Partnership may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties, in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through a sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P18_S1	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P18_S2	The Partnership expects to acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Partnership expects to provide the mortgage revenue bonds to the new property owners as part of the restructuring.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P20_S2	The increase in revenue and a decrease in loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year can be attributed to the completion and lease up of The 50/50 in 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P20_S3	The increase in revenue and loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year can be attributed to the foreclosure of Woodland Park mortgage revenue bond during 2013 and the acquisition of The Colonial (f/k/a Maples on 97th) properties which was owned an entire year in 2013 (see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM7_P21_S4	In 2012 approximately $1.4 million gain was realized from the sales of the Commons at Churchland and Eagle Ridge properties (see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S0	Tender Option Bond ( TOB ) Financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S1	In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) which allows the Company to execute multiple Tender Option Bond financing facility ( TOB Trust ) structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S2	Under each TOB Trust structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues senior floating-rate participation interests ( SPEARS ) and residual participating interests ( LIFERS ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S3	These SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S4	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P22_S5	During 2014, the Company closed six new TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P23_S0	During 2013, the Company closed six new TOB Trusts.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P26_S1	The Company also owed approximately $81.4 million under six TOB Trusts which securitized ten mortgage revenue bonds with a par value of approximately $121.2 million at December 31, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P27_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the total cost of borrowing for the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities was approximately 2.2% and 2.3% per annum, respectively, and the weighted average cost of borrowing on the TOB financing facilities securitizing mortgage-backed securities was approximately 1.1% and 1.3% per annum, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P27_S1	The Company s total cost of borrowing under the TOB financing facilities collateralized by the mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 3.9% and 2.7% per annum as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P27_S2	The Company accounts for these TOB transactions as secured financing arrangements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S0	On July 10, 2014, the Partnership and its newly created consolidated subsidiary, ATAX TEBS II, LLC ( 2014 Sponsor ), entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S1	The gross proceeds from this M31 TEBS Financing was approximately $94.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Partnership received net proceeds from the M31 TEBS Financing of approximately $91.6 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S3	The Partnership applied approximately $72.4 million of these net proceeds to retire the short-term securitizations that previously existed on these bonds and approximately $6.3 million to a stabilization escrow.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S4	The approximate $6.3 million is reported as restricted cash on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P28_S5	The Company owes approximately $94.7 million at December 31, 2014 (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P29_S0	On September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its consolidated subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of 13 mortgage revenue bonds pursuant to Freddie Mac s TEBS program.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P29_S1	The gross proceeds from this M24 TEBS Financing was approximately $95.8 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P29_S2	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Company received net proceeds from the M24 TEBS Financing of approximately $90.4 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P29_S3	After the 2014 redemption of the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond, the Company securitized 12 mortgage revenue bonds and owes approximately $76.4 and $93.0 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P30_S0	The M31 and M24 TEBS Financing essentially provides the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P30_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the total cost of borrowing was 1.5% per annum for the M31 TEBS Financing facility.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P30_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the total cost of borrowing was 2.0% per annum for the M24 TEBS Financing facility (see interest rate derivative discussion in Item 7a).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P31_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets, and the resulting availability of debt financing has improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P31_S1	The decline in construction and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily properties during the previous credit crisis, in our view, continues to create potential investment opportunities for the Partnership in both mortgage revenue bonds as well as quality MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P31_S2	Our ability to restructure existing debt together with the ability to improve the operations of the MF Properties through our affiliated property management company can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run multifamily residential property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P31_S3	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our shareholders in the form of a strong mortgage revenue bond investment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S0	On the other hand, economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that the Partnership uses to partially finance its investment portfolio or otherwise meet its liquidity requirements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S1	The economic conditions including sluggish job growth and low home mortgage interest rates have had a negative effect on some of the Residential Properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S2	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the year) will result in lower economic occupancy.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S3	The overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the stabilized Residential Properties that the Partnership has financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 91% during 2014 and 90% during 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S4	The economic occupancy of the stabilized MF Properties has increased to approximately 86% during 2014 as compared to 82% during 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM7_P32_S5	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P33_S0	The following discussion describes the operations and financial results of the individual Residential Properties financed by the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and the MF Properties in which it holds an ownership.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P33_S1	The discussion also outlines the bond holdings of the Partnership, discusses the significant terms of the bonds and identifies those ownership entities which are Consolidated VIEs of the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P34_S0	(1) Economic occupancy is presented for 2014 and 2013, and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P144_S4	In addition, a decrease of approximately $178,000 resulted from a decrease in interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P144_S5	The Company s borrowing cost decreased to approximately 2.6% per annum during 2013 as compared to approximately 2.7% per annum during 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P145_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses is due to offsetting factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P145_S1	An approximate $623,000 increase is related to increased administrative fees payable to AFCA 2 related to the acquisition of the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS, and the Arbors at Hickory Ridge Apartments, Vantage at Judson, Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Renaissance Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar in 09, and Vantage at Harlingen Apartments mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P145_S2	The remaining increase is comprised of increased professional fees, printing expenses and travel expenses during 2013 as compared to 2012 offset by incentive compensation recorded in 2012 which did not recur in 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P146_S0	The majority of the increase is attributable to the gain of approximately $1.8 million from the recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties and approximately $1.4 million from the recognition of the sale of the Greens Property in 2013.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P150_S1	Investment income increased during 2014 as compared to 2013 by approximately $3.4 million due to offsetting factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P150_S2	The increase is due to an approximate $10.2 million increase in investment income as the result of the addition of the mortgage revenue bonds acquired in 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P150_S3	These increases were offset by a decrease of approximately $6.6 million of investment income due to the recognition of the Greens Property sale in the third quarter of 2013, recognition of the Ohio sale in first quarter of 2013, the redemption of the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond and the completion of the foreclosure of the Woodland Park mortgage revenue bond in the second quarter of 2013, the sale of the Autumn Pines mortgage revenue bond in the second quarter of 2014, the redemption of the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond in the first quarter 2014, the MBS sales in 2014, and the principal payments received on the mortgage revenue bond and PHC investments.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P152_S1	The decrease in other interest income when comparing 2014 to 2013 is mostly attributable to taxable interest income from the taxable property loans which were securitized by the Ohio Properties and recognized in 2013 when the Company was able to recognize the sale of the Ohio Properties (see Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM7_P155_S1	A portion of real estate operating expenses are fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P155_S2	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P156_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P156_S1	A decrease includes approximately $106,000 in Glynn Place s repair expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P156_S2	Offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately $891,000 related to The 50/50, which began leasing up in August 2014, and Woodland Park, which became an MF Property effective June 1, 2013 (see Note 7 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM7_P157_S3	There was no realized loss on taxable property loans reported during 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P158_S0	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates its investments for impairment.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P161_S1	The net increase in depreciation and amortization when comparing 2014 to 2013 was the result of offsetting factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P161_S2	There was an approximate $429,000 decrease in in-place lease amortization related to the The Colonial and Woodland Park as these were fully amortized in 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P161_S3	This decrease was offset by an approximate $947,000 increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to The 50/50 which began leasing up in August 2014 and depreciation expense related to Woodland Park which became an MF Property effective June 1, 2013 (see Note 7 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM7_P162_S0	The net increase in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was partly due to an approximate $1.7 million increase resulting from the change in the mark to market adjustment of the Company s derivatives.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P162_S1	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P162_S2	In addition, an increase of approximately $2.4 million resulted from higher average outstanding debt principal between the two periods.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P163_S0	The increase in general and administrative expenses when comparing 2014 to 2013 is attributable to an approximate $755,000 increase in administrative fees payable to AFCA 2 related to the newly acquired mortgage revenue bonds in 2014 offset by an approximate $120,000 reduction due to the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond redemption and the Autumn Pines mortgage revenue bond sale.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P163_S1	In addition the Partnership realized an increase of approximately $715,000 in professional fees and salary and benefits.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P166_S1	This income increased during 2013 as compared to 2012 by approximately $11.6 million due to various factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P166_S2	Approximately $5.7 million of the increase in investment income is due to the recognition of the sale of the Ohio and Greens Properties during 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P166_S3	This income is interest payments received by the Partnership since it acquired the Ohio Properties mortgage revenue bonds in June 2010 and the Greens Property s mortgage revenue bonds in October 2012 which previously were deferred due to the deposit method of accounting (see Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P166_S4	Approximately $4.4 million of the increase in interest income is the result of the addition of the Arbors at Hickory Ridge, Vantage at Judson, Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Renaissance Apartments, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, Avistar in 09 Apartments, Vantage at Harlingen Apartments, Tyler Park Townhomes, and Westside Village Market mortgage revenue bonds.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S0	Primary sources and uses of funds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S1	Interest earned on the mortgage revenue bonds, including those financing properties held by Consolidated VIEs, represents the Partnership s principal source of cash flow.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S2	The Partnership also earns interest from its PHC Certificates, and MBS and may also receive cash distributions from equity interests held in MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S3	Interest is primarily comprised of base interest payments received on the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S4	Certain of the mortgage revenue bonds may also generate payments of contingent interest to the Partnership from time to time when the underlying apartment properties generate excess cash flow.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P179_S5	Because base interest on each of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds and MBS is fixed, the Partnership s cash receipts tend to be fairly constant period to period unless the Partnership acquires or disposes of its investments in mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P180_S0	Changes in the economic performance of the properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds with a contingent interest provision will affect the amount of contingent interest, if any, paid to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P181_S0	The Consolidated VIEs and MF Properties primary source of cash is net rental revenues generated by their real estate investments.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P182_S0	The economic performance of a multifamily, student housing, or senior citizen apartment property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P182_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P182_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P182_S3	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P183_S0	The primary uses of cash by apartment properties are the payment of operating expenses and debt service.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P184_S0	Other sources of cash available to the Partnership include debt financing, mortgages, and the sale of additional BUCs.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P184_S1	The Company currently has outstanding debt financing of $345.4 million under twelve separate credit facilities and mortgages of $76.7 million secured by nine MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P185_S0	The Partnership s principal uses of cash are the payment of distributions to shareholders, interest and principal on debt financing and general and administrative expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P185_S1	The Partnership also uses cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S0	Distributions to shareholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S1	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by the Partnership from its portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of the Partnership s outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by the Partnership on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by the Partnership and the number of units outstanding.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2014 , the Partnership generated cash available for distribution of $0.40 per unit, (see Cash Available for Distribution ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S3	As a result, the Partnership was required to supplement its cash available for distribution during 2014, with unrestricted cash and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current plans to invest the net proceeds it realized from the most recent M31 TEBS Financing facility.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S4	The General Partner believes that upon completion of its current investment and leverage plans, the Partnership will be able to meet its liquidity requirements, including the payment of expenses, interest on its debt financing, and cash distributions to shareholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of unrestricted cash.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S5	See Cash Available for Distribution for a further description of the General Partner s proposed course of action in connection with these matters.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S6	However, if leverage plans are delayed, actual results may vary from current projections.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P186_S7	If the actual CAD generated continues to be less than the regular distribution to shareholders, such distribution amount may need to be reduced.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P187_S0	The Consolidated VIEs and MF Properties primary uses of cash are: (i) the payment of operating expenses; and (ii) the payment of debt service.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P188_S0	The Partnership utilizes leverage for the purpose of enhancing investor returns.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P188_S1	Management uses target constraints for each type of short term financing utilized by the Partnership to manage an overall 65% leverage constraint.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P188_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P188_S3	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 65%.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P188_S4	The overall leverage constraint of the Partnership, total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the par value of the mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties at cost, is approximately 59%, as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM7_P189_S0	On July 10, 2014 and September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, ATAX TEBS II, LLC and ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to long-term debt financing facilities pursuant to Freddie Mac s TEBS program.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P189_S1	The M31 and M24 TEBS Financings essentially provide the Company with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P189_S2	The M31 and M24 TEBS Financing facilities offer several advantages over the Company s previous credit facilities which, over time, are expected to positively impact the generation of CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P189_S3	These advantages include: a longer term thereby addressing the previous refinancing risks, better balance sheet leverage thereby providing additional funds for investment, and a lower initial cost of borrowing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S0	Under the M31 TEBS Financing, the Partnership and its newly created consolidated subsidiary, ATAX TEBS II, LLC ( 2014 Sponsor ), entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of thirteen mortgage revenue bonds, with a par value of approximately $118.4 million, owned by the the 2014 Sponsor pursuant to the M31 TEBS Financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S1	The M31 TEBS Financing facility essentially provides the Partnership with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds were then securitized by transferring these assets to Freddie Mac in exchange for Class A and Class B Freddie Mac Multifamily Variable Rate Certificates (collectively, the M31 TEBS Certificates ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S3	The M31 TEBS Certificates represent beneficial interests in the securitized assets held by Freddie Mac.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S4	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of approximately $94.7 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S5	The Class B M31 TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of approximately $23.7 million and were retained by the 2014 Sponsor.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S6	The gross proceeds from the M31 TEBS Financing were approximately $94.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S7	After the payment of transaction expenses, the Partnership received net proceeds from the M31 TEBS Financing of approximately $91.6 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S8	The Partnership applied approximately $72.4 million of these net proceeds to retire the short-term securitization that previously existed on these bonds and approximately $6.3 million to a stabilization escrow.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P190_S9	The approximate $6.3 million is reported as restricted cash on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P191_S0	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus certain credit, facility, remarketing and servicing fees (the Facility Fees ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P191_S1	The total Facility Fees are 1.4% per annum, and as of December 31, 2014, the SIFMA rate was equal to approximately 0.1% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 1.5% per annum on the outstanding balance of the M31 TEBS Financing facility of approximately $94.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P191_S2	The M31 TEBS Financing and the associated M31 TEBS Trust are presented as secured financings within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P191_S3	At December 31, 2014, the Partnership reported approximately $6.3 million as restricted cash on the balance sheet.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P192_S0	Under the M24 TEBS Financing, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of thirteen mortgage revenue bonds owned by the ATAX TEBS I, LLC (the 2010 Sponsor ) pursuant to the M24 TEBS Financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P192_S1	The M24 TEBS Financing facility essentially provides the Partnership with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S0	The securitization of these mortgage revenue bonds occurred through two classes of certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S3	As of December 31, 2014, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.1% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 2.0% per annum on the outstanding balance on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of $76.4 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S4	As of December 31, 2013, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.1% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 2.0% per annum on the outstanding balance on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of $93.0 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P193_S5	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Partnership reported approximately $718,000 and $727,000, respectively as restricted cash on the balance sheet.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates are made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S3	Freddie Mac has guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A TEBS Certificates and also guarantees payment of the purchase price of any Class A TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms but which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S4	The Sponsor has pledged the Class B TEBS Certificates to Freddie Mac to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Sponsor to Freddie Mac.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S5	The Company also entered into various subordination and intercreditor agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Company has subordinated its rights and remedies with respect to the taxable property loans made by it to the owners of properties securing certain of the Bonds to the rights of Freddie Mac as the holder of the Bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S6	For financial reporting purposes, the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing are presented by the Company as secured financings (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S7	In July 2011, the Company executed a Master Trust Agreement with DB which allows the Company to execute multiple TOB Trust structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S8	Under each TOB Trust structure issued through the Master Trust Agreement, the TOB trustee issues SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S9	Theses SPEARS and LIFERS represent beneficial interests in the securitized asset held by the TOB trustee.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P194_S10	The Company will purchase the LIFERS from each of these TOB Trusts which will grant them certain rights to the securitized assets.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S0	The Master Trust Agreement with DB has covenants with which the Company is required to maintain compliance.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S1	At December 31, 2014, the most restrictive covenant was that cash available to distribute for the trailing twelve months must be at least two times trailing twelve month interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S2	The Company was in compliance with all of these covenants as of December 31, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S3	If the Company were to be out of compliance with any of these covenants, it would trigger a termination event of the financing facilities.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S4	The Company expects to renew each of the TOB financing facilities at its discretion per the terms of the agreements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P195_S5	DB can require the posting of cash collateral under the terms of the Master Trust Agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P196_S0	In October 2014, the Partnership executed two new TOB Trusts under its credit facility with DB securitizing the Pro Nova 2014-1 and 2014-2 mortgage revenue bonds borrowing approximately $9.0 million under each TOB Trust.

1059142_15_ITEM7_P212_S0	As a result, the TOB trusts essentially provide the Company with a secured variable rate debt facility at interest rates that reflect the prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates paid by the TOB trusts on the SPEARS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P212_S1	Payments made to the holders of the SPEARS and the amount of trust fees essentially represent the Company s effective cost of borrowing on the net proceeds it received from the sale of the SPEARS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P212_S2	The holders of the SPEARS are entitled to receive regular payments from the TOB trusts at a variable rate established by a third party remarketing firm that is expected to be similar to the weekly SIFMA floating index rate.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P212_S3	Payments on the SPEARS will be made prior to any payments on the LIFERS held by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P212_S4	The Company is accounting for these transactions as secured financing arrangements (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).

1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S0	On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $3.2 million compared to the same period a year earlier mainly due to changes in working capital components.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S1	Cash used for investing activities decreased approximately $52.5 million for 2014 as compared to 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S2	During 2014, approximately $174.9 million of cash was used for mortgage revenue bond acquisitions, capital improvements and land held for investment, interest rate derivatives, net increase in notes receivable, and restricted cash related to the M31 TEBS Financing facility.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S3	Offsetting this usage was an approximate $1.7 million received from the release of restricted cash in connection with the TOB financing facilities, approximately $60.4 million received from the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond redemption, the Autumn Pines mortgage revenue bond sale, and MBS sale, and approximately $7.2 million bond principal received related to the PHC and mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S4	During 2013, the Company used approximately $177.2 million for the purchase of the mortgage revenue bonds and related taxable mortgage bonds, MBS, and the construction of the MF Properties in 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P216_S5	Offsetting the use of cash from investing activities, the Company received approximately $4.0 million in net cash related to the realization of the Ohio Properties sale, approximately $21.9 million from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption, and approximately $2.8 million from principal repayments related to investments.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P217_S0	The Company had approximately $1.1 million more cash available from financing activities during 2014 as compared to 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P217_S1	Financing cash flows in 2014 included approximately $51.3 million from the sale of beneficial unit certificates, approximately $186.8 million from the M31 TEBS Financing and the four TOB financings, and approximately $22.6 million in construction loan borrowing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P217_S2	The Company used approximately $101.8 million to repay TOB financing facilities and mortgages payable (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements), approximately $2.9 million for debt financing costs, and approximately $30.2 million to pay distributions.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P217_S3	Financing cash flows in 2013 included approximately $48.2 million of cash from the sale of BUCs, approximately $81.5 million of cash from new TOB Trust financing facilities, $20.7 million of cash from borrowing on The Colonial (f/k/a Maples on 97th), Woodland Park and the The 50/50 project, offset by the use of cash to pay distributions and principal payments on debt.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P218_S0	Management utilizes a calculation of CAD as a means to determine the Partnership s ability to make distributions to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P218_S1	The General Partner believes that CAD provides relevant information about its operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding its operating results.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P219_S0	To calculate CAD, the Partnership adds back non-cash expenses consisting of amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for loan losses, impairments on bonds, losses related to VIEs including depreciation expense, and income received in cash from transactions which have been eliminated in consolidation, to the Partnership s net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP and deducts Tier 2 income attributable to the General Partner as defined in the Partnership Agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P220_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P221_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P221_S1	Although the Company considers CAD to be a useful measure of its operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P222_S0	CAD for the years ended 2014 and 2013 included income from certain transactions which may not recur in future periods.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P222_S1	For the year ended 2014 the Partnership reported $0.40 of CAD per unit which includes approximately $0.011 of CAD per unit (approximately $650,000 of CAD) from the sale of the Autumn Pines bond and approximately $0.037 of CAD per unit (approximately $2.1 million of CAD) from the redemption of the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P222_S2	For the year ended 2013 the Partnership reported $0.42 of CAD per unit which includes $0.065 of CAD per unit (approximately $2.8 million of CAD) from the redemption of the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond and interest and other income recognized from the Ohio Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P222_S3	The sale and redemption gains were Tier 2 income with 25% allocated to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S0	The Partnership has made annual cash distributions of $0.50 per unit since 2009.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S1	Since realized CAD per unit was less than $0.50 per unit in 2014, 2013, and 2012, the Partnership paid approximately $6.0 million, $4.0 million, and $5.8 million of the distribution using unrestricted cash to supplement the deficit in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, which was a return of capital to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S2	The Partnership has historically supplemented its cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash when necessary and expects to continue to do so until the Partnership is able to complete its current plans to increase leverage through additional TEBS financing facilities and to invest the net proceeds realized by the Partnership from the issuance of BUCs in December 2013 and January 2014 on a leveraged basis.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S3	The General Partner has identified a pipeline of mortgage revenue bonds it intends to acquire in 2015 and is actively performing due diligence on these mortgage revenue bonds to ensure they meet the Partnership s investment criteria.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S4	The General Partner is also working with the Partnership s primary lender to finance a portion of the acquisition of these bonds and believes that upon completion of its current investment plans, the Partnership will be able to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to shareholders at the current level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S5	However, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P223_S6	In that case, the annual distribution rate per unit may need to be reduced.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P224_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership s net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to its CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 .
1059142_15_ITEM7_P225_S0	(1) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the shareholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P225_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P226_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company realized the sale of the Autumn Pines bond which resulted in an approximate $873,000 gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $218,000, realized the redemption of the Lost Creek bond which resulted in an approximate $2.8 million gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $709,000, and received contingent interest from Ashley Square generating $10,000 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P227_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P227_S1	The Company determined that the approximate $1.8 million gain from the sale of the Ohio Properties was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P227_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P228_S0	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557K recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668K recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the discontinued operations (Churchland at Commons and Eagle Village MF Properties).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S0	(2) The developer income amount represents cash received by the Partnership for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S1	The development at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S2	For purposes of CAD, management is treating these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S3	(3) The Partnership sold the Greens Property in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S4	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S5	For this reason, the General Partner concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S6	(4) In July 2013, the Company recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S7	The Company was required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer to the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S8	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by the Partnership between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S9	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P229_S10	(5) The recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties allowed the Company to 1) realize approximately $4.2 million of interest income on the mortgage revenue bonds, 2) recognize approximately $1.1 million of taxable interest income on taxable property loans receivable it holds with the Ohio Properties, and 3) realize a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner owner of the Ohio Properties all in 2013 (see Note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P230_S0	Mortgage interest income of $3.5 million of the $4.2 million had been previously received by the Partnership and reported in CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P231_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Partnership held mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P231_S1	The Residential Properties are owned by entities that are not controlled by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P231_S2	The Partnership has no equity interest in these entities and does not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P231_S3	Some of the ownership entities are deemed to be Consolidated VIEs and are consolidated with the Partnership for financial reporting purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P231_S4	The VIEs that are consolidated with the Partnership do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P232_S0	The Partnership does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P232_S1	As such, the Partnership is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P233_S0	The Partnership does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Partnership or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P234_S0	The Partnership has the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014:
1059142_15_ITEM7_P235_S0	As discussed in Notes 11 and 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2015 consist of the paydowns on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P236_S0	The Partnership s strategic objective is to leverage its bond portfolio utilizing long term securitization financings with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P236_S1	This strategy allows the Partnership to better match the duration of its assets and liabilities and to lock in a spread between its assets and liabilities.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P236_S2	The Partnership intends to refinance all of its maturing short term debt obligations with the proceeds of at least one additional TEBS financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P237_S0	In December 2014, the Partnership entered into a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement ( Bond Purchase Commitment ) to purchase an approximately up to $20.0 million new mortgage revenue bond secured by a multifamily property, Villas at Plano Gateway Senior Living Apartments, under construction in Plano, Texas.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P237_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P238_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records any changes in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P238_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $1.1 million (see Note17 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P239_S0	In July 2014, the Partnership entered into a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase up to an approximately $9.9 million new mortgage revenue bond secured by a multifamily property, 15 West Apartments, under construction in Vancouver, Washington.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P239_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.25% and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P240_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and records any changes in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P240_S1	At December 31, 2014, the Partnership has estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $809,000 (see Note17 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P241_S0	In August 2013, the Partnership acquired a approximate $6.7 million par value Series C mortgage revenue bond secured by the Vantage at Harlingen Apartments.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P241_S1	Under the terms of a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement, the Partnership has agreed to purchase a new mortgage revenue bond between $18,000,000 to $24,692,000 ( Harlingen Series B Bond ) secured by the Vantage at Harlingen apartments which will be delivered by the mortgage revenue bond issuer once the property meets specific obligations and occupancy rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P241_S2	The final amount of the Series B Bond will depend on the appraisal of the stabilized property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P241_S3	The Harlingen Series B Bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the construction loan to the bank and all or a portion of the $6.7 million subordinate Series C mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P242_S0	The Partnership accounts for the bond purchase commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in the estimated fair value of the bond purchase commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P242_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $1.4 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P242_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $1.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P242_S3	(See Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P243_S0	In June 2013, the Partnership executed a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase an $8.0 million new mortgage revenue bond and a $500,000 taxable mortgage bond both secured by a multifamily property, Silver Moon, under construction in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P243_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum, the taxable mortgage bond will have a stated rate of 12% per annum, and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P244_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P244_S1	As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets approximately $414,000.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P244_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $600,000 (see Note17 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S0	In December 2012, the Partnership purchased a $6,049,000 mortgage revenue bond ( Series C Bonds ) and a $934,000 taxable mortgage bond both secured by the Vantage at Judson apartments.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S1	This property is located in San Antonio, Texas and construction on this property was complete in the summer of 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S2	In connection with the purchase of these bonds, the Partnership also executed a Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement with the borrower under the bonds, the issuer of the $6,049,000 mortgage revenue bond ( Issuer ), and the Bank which is providing the remainder of the construction financing and has the first lien on the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S3	Under the terms of this agreement and the Trust Indenture, the Issuer has agreed to fund up to $26,687,000 of senior mortgage revenue bonds ( Series B Bonds ) to allow for the full refunding of the Bank s construction loan ( Series A Bonds ) and all or a portion of the $6,049,000 Series C Bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S4	The Partnership has an obligation to purchase the Series B Bonds upon the successful completion of specific conversion conditions.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S5	These conversion conditions include no material default by borrower under the trust indenture, the completion of the survey of the property and title insurance, and occupancy of 90% for 90 days at the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S6	The amount of the Series B Bonds will be no less than $20,638,000 and the final amount will depend on the reallocation calculation which is defined as 80% bond to appraised property value and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.0.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S7	As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $2.0 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P245_S8	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership estimated the value of this bond purchase commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $2.0 million (See Note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P246_S0	With respect to the financial results of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the Residential Properties, which collateralize the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P246_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P246_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P246_S3	Inflation did not have a significant impact on the Partnership s financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P247_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P247_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P247_S2	All of the Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P247_S3	The Company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies because they involve judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P247_S4	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P248_S0	Accounting for the TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the M31 and M24 TEBS and TOB financing arrangements (see Note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transactions.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P248_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P248_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_15_ITEM7_P249_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P249_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P249_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S0	The M31 and M24 TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2010 as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S2	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2014 as two specific dates, July 15, 2019 or July 15, 2024, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S3	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S4	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing being presented on the Company s consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P250_S5	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the LIFERS so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company s consolidated financial statements as secured financings.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P251_S0	In addition to evaluating the M31 and M24 TEBS Financings as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trusts associated with the TEBS financing facilities (the M31 TEBS Trust and M24 TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P251_S1	As part of the M31 and M24 TEBS Financings, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts with Freddie Mac.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P251_S2	The M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P251_S3	Other Company investments are securitized into TOB Trusts with Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P252_S0	The TOB trustee then issued SPEARS and LIFERS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P252_S1	The Partnership has determined that the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts are VIEs and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P252_S2	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are VIEs and the LIFERS owned by the Company create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P253_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P254_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P254_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE s management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P254_S2	While in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trusts and the liabilities of the trusts do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P255_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P255_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P256_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P256_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing facilities and the associated M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts are presented as secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P256_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P257_S0	The Partnership invests in mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P257_S1	The Partnership generally owns 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P257_S2	The Partnership has also made taxable property loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P258_S0	Although each multifamily and student housing property financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership is owned by a separate entity in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P259_S0	Under the consolidation accounting guidance (effective January 1, 2010), the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P260_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack: i. the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting or similar rights; ii.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P260_S1	the obligation to absorb the expected loss of the entity; or iii.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P260_S2	the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P261_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P261_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P261_S2	In adopting this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners were VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership was the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P261_S3	The guidance also requires an ongoing assessment of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P262_S0	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of entities which are secured by the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P262_S1	In December 2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity, which created a re-consideration event and resulted in Lake Forest no longer being reported as a Consolidated VIE beginning December 1, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P262_S2	No changes in the VIEs have occurred subsequent to that date.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P262_S3	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of two of the VIEs, Bent Tree, and Fairmont Oaks, and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P262_S4	At December 31, 2014, the Partnership held multiple mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased after January 1, 2010; the evaluation of these entities did not result in required consolidation.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P263_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs and, therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P263_S1	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs relate to the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying multifamily property which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Property Loans Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S1	The Company generally owns 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S3	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S5	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P264_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and management s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P265_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , all of the Company s mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P266_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S0	The key assumption in management s yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 4.7% to 8.3% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 5.1% to 9.1% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $26.2 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P267_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P268_S0	The estimated future cash flow of each revenue bond depends on the operations of the underlying property and, therefore, is subject to a significant amount of uncertainty in the estimation of future rental receipts, future real estate operating expenses, and future capital expenditures.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P268_S1	Such estimates are affected by economic factors such as the rental markets and labor markets in which the property operates, the current capitalization rates for properties in the rental markets, and tax and insurance expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P268_S2	Different conditions or different assumptions applied to the calculation may provide different results.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P268_S3	The Partnership periodically compares its estimates with historical results to evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of its estimates and adjusts its estimates accordingly.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P269_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P269_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_15_ITEM7_P270_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P271_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P271_S1	The ability to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P272_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P272_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P272_S2	The model reflects the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying property over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bond in accordance with the accounting guidance on other than temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P272_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make numerous subjective assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_15_ITEM7_P273_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P274_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P275_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P275_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 4.3% and 7.5% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for multifamily and student housing properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P276_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P277_S0	Operating results from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P278_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P279_S0	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P279_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P279_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P280_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, we believe that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P280_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P280_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P280_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P281_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P282_S0	If the credit and capital markets deteriorate further or the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P283_S0	Evaluation of property loans for potential losses - In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P283_S1	All of these loans are made on a non-recourse basis.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P283_S2	As a result, the repayment of these loans depend on the cash flows generated by the underlying property.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P283_S3	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P283_S4	The Company estimates the fair value of the property and compares the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any property loans.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P284_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property s fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P284_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P284_S2	We may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P285_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P285_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P286_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive for the sale of the PHC certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S3	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management s estimates.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S4	The PHC Certificates are AA and BBB rated by S P. At December 31, 2014, the range of effective yields on the individual PHC certificates was 4.2% to 5.4% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S5	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structured security.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S6	Assuming a ten percent adverse change in this key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC certificates would increase to a range of 4.7% to 6.0% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.3 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S7	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P287_S8	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P288_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P288_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_15_ITEM7_P289_S0	A decrease in the ratio of annual appropriations received by the Public Housing Authority from the HUD Capital Fund Program compared to the required principal and interest payments due on the loans payable by the Public Housing Authority to the three separate TOB Trusts with DB ( PHC Trusts ).
1059142_15_ITEM7_P290_S0	Investment in Mortgage-Backed Securities Valuation - The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P290_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P290_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P291_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P291_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P291_S2	At December 31, 2014, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.7% to 5.2% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P291_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P291_S4	Assuming a ten percent adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.1% to 5.8% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $806,000.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P292_S0	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P292_S1	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P293_S0	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P293_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of an MBS below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P293_S2	Each MBS security has been rated either AAA or AA by either S P or Moody s.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P293_S3	A downgrade in rating for and MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody s below the A rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other than temporary.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P294_S0	Revenue recognition - mortgage revenue bonds - Interest on the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds is payable solely from the net cash flow of the underlying properties and reserve funds, if any, set aside pursuant to the bond documents.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P294_S1	These bonds are not the obligations of the state or local housing authorities that issued them and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P295_S0	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P295_S1	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P295_S2	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P295_S3	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond s ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P295_S4	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P296_S0	Revenue recognition - investments in real estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates - The Partnership s Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements) are lessors of multifamily rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P296_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P297_S0	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P298_S0	The Partnership s investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative financial instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activity.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P298_S1	The guidance requires the Partnership to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in its financial statements and record these instruments at their fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P298_S2	In order to achieve hedge accounting treatment, derivative instruments must be appropriately designated, documented and prove to be effective as a hedge.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P298_S3	The Partnership did not designate its current derivatives as qualifying hedges.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P299_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P299_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P299_S2	The fair value adjustment through earnings can cause a significant fluctuation in reported net income although it has no impact on the Partnership s cash flows.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P300_S0	Although the Company utilizes current price quotes by recognized dealers as a basis for estimating the fair value of its interest rate derivative agreements, the calculation of the fair value involves a considerable degree of judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM7_P301_S0	For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, please see footnote 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The Partnership s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and credit risk.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The Partnership s exposure to market risks relates primarily to its investments in mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and its debt financing.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS are also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P1_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of these investments to decrease.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the assets do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners capital and book value per unit.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P1_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS decreases, the Partnership may need to provide additional collateral for its debt financing secured by these assets.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P2_S0	The Partnership bases the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, which have a limited market, on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P2_S1	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P2_S2	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P3_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , all of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management s discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P3_S1	The PHC Certificates were valued using management s yield to maturity analyses and the mortgage-backed securities were priced using third-party pricing services.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P3_S2	Pricing services, broker quotes, and management s analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P3_S3	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds and the PHC Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the Partnership s control.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P5_S1	The nature of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS, and the debt financing used to finance these assets exposes the Partnership to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P5_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS all bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P5_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds may additionally pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P5_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , the weighted average base rate of the mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.0% per annum, the weighted average base rate of the PHC Trust Certificates was approximately 5.0% per annum and the weighted average coupon rate of the MBS was approximately 5.0% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P6_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Partnership has approximately $94.7 million borrowed under the M31 TEBS Financing agreement and approximately $74.4 million M24 TEBS Financing agreement that provides for interest at a floating rate equal to weekly SIFMA plus 142 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P6_S1	As a result, the Partnership s cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P6_S2	The effective interest rate for these credit facilities as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 1.5% per annum and approximately 2.0% per annum, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P6_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2014 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P7_S0	At December 31, 2014, the Partnership has approximately $174.3 million in TOB facilities that provide for interest at floating rates based on weekly SIFMA plus a fee stack.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P7_S1	As a result, the Partnership s cost of borrowing fluctuates with the weekly SIFMA.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The effective interest rate for the TOB facilities as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 3.3% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P7_S3	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2014 , the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.9 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The interest rate of the mortgage financing on the MF Properties fluctuates based on the LIBOR.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P8_S1	Accordingly, the cost of borrowing on the debt will increase as the LIBOR increases.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P8_S2	As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance of the mortgage financing of the MF Properties was $76.7 million.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P8_S3	The weighted average effective interest rate for 2014 on the debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 was approximately 3.9% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P8_S4	If the average LIBOR Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2014, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $767,000.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P9_S0	The Partnership is managing its interest rate risk on its debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements that cap the amount of interest expense it could pay on its floating rate debt financing as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P10_S0	In July 2014, to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate M31 TEBS Financing, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.6 million, which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 15, 2019.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P10_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the M31 TEBS Financing facility of 4.4% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P11_S0	In February 2014, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements with SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. for a notional amount of $70.0 million with an effective start date of March 1, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P11_S1	These agreements effectively limit the interest component of the TOB financing correlated with the SIFMA index to a maximum of 1.0% on $70.0 million of the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities and the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities through a three year term ending March 1, 2017.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P12_S0	In September 2010, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements in connection with M24 TEBS Financing with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the M24 TEBS Financing facility to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership s interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2014:
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P14_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P14_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $2.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , as compared to an increase of approximately $284,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P15_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P15_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $268,000 and $888,000 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The Partnership s primary credit risk is the risk of default on its portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans collateralized by the Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P16_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities or any insurer or other party.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P16_S2	In addition, the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable property loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P16_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable property loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale of these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P17_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the Partnership s mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P18_S0	A property s ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential properties in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P19_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P19_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P20_S0	The Company also has credit risk in its investment in PHC Certificates, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P20_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P20_S2	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P21_S0	Defaults on its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable property loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to shareholders.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P21_S1	In addition, if a property s net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P21_S2	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan secured by the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P22_S0	In the event of a default on a mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan, the Partnership will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P22_S1	If the Partnership takes ownership of the property securing a defaulted mortgage revenue bond, it will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P22_S2	If such an event occurs, such amounts may not provide tax-exempt income to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P23_S0	The Partnership s primary method of managing the credit risks associated with its mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans is to perform a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these mortgage revenue bonds and loans and to carefully monitor the performance of such property on a continuous basis.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P24_S0	The Company s primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the rating report issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P25_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2014 , it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_15_ITEM7A_P25_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks on the Partnership will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, the Partnership s risk mitigating strategies at that time and overall business and economic environment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P0_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, partners capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P1_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P1_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P2_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P2_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P2_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P3_S0	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P4_S0	As discussed in Notes 5, 6 and 9, the consolidated financial statements include total investments valued at approximately $521,000,000 (70% of total assets) and $351,500,000 (66% of total assets) as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P4_S1	At December 31, 2014 and 2013, management s estimates were based on discounted cash flows or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P5_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 5, 2015, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P6_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P7_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P8_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P10_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P11_S0	America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. (the Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P11_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P11_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P12_S0	Our general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P12_S1	The Partnership will terminate on December 31, 2050, unless terminated earlier under provisions of its Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P13_S0	Principles of Consolidation The Company refers to the Partnership and the consolidated VIEs (defined below).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P14_S0	The consolidated financial statements of the Company reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership, the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries (each a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest, two entities in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership and which are treated as variable interest entities ( VIEs ) of which the Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary (the Consolidated VIEs ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P14_S1	The Consolidated Subsidiaries of the Partnership consist of:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P15_S0	Financing ( M24 TEBS Financing ) with Freddie Mac (Note 11).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P16_S0	ATAX TEBS II, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created in 2014 to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the second TEBS financing ( M31 TEBS Financing ) with Freddie Mac (Note 11).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P17_S0	Nine multifamily residential properties, including multifamily, student, and senior citizen housing ( MF Properties ) which are either wholly or majority owned by subsidiaries of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P18_S0	Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of the entities which own the Residential Properties and commercial property financed with mortgage revenue bonds it holds to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P19_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P20_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P20_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P20_S2	Upon adoption of this revised accounting standard, the Partnership re-evaluated all of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P20_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P20_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P21_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P22_S0	Stand-alone financial information of the Partnership reported in this Form 10-K includes only the financial position and results of operation of the Partnership and the MF Properties without the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P22_S1	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership, the MF Properties and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P23_S0	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of the VIEs for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership s tax status, amounts reported to Beneficial Unit Certificate ( BUC ) holders on IRS Form K-1, the Partnership s ability to distribute income to unitholders which it believes to be tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P24_S0	Acquisition Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on acquisition accounting, the Company allocates the contractual purchase price of a property acquired to the land, building, and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P24_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P25_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P25_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P26_S0	The acquisition related costs to acquire a property are expensed as incurred.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P27_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S0	Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S1	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is equal to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S2	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S3	The Company is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S4	The Company does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P28_S5	This risk is minimized significantly by the Company s portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P29_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash, which is legally restricted to use, is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balances, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P29_S1	At December 31, 2014 , certain of our credit facilities require restricted cash balances as additional collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P29_S2	Specifically, the 2014 and 2010 tax exempt bond securitization ( TEBS ) financing facilities, discussed below, required approximately $7.3 million , the three tender option bonds ( TOB ) trusts ( TOB Trusts ) secured by the Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates ( PHC Certificates ) financing facilities ( PHC TOB Trusts ) required approximately $400,000 , and the TOB Trusts secured by mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) financing facilities ( MBS TOB Trusts ) required approximately $2.1 million held in restricted cash.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P30_S0	Interest Receivable Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s financial statements on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, certain amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been restated to correct an error related to the presentation of interest receivable on taxable loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P30_S1	Such correction recorded the loan loss reserve related to interest receivable against the interest receivable line of the consolidated balance sheet rather than against the other assets line, which includes the principle amount of taxable loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P30_S2	This correction resulted in a decrease in interest receivable and an increase in other assets of approximately $6.2 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P30_S3	This correction did not have an impact on total assets as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and did not have an impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P30_S4	The statement of cash flows has also been restated to reflect this adjustment for all periods presented.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P31_S0	Investment in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Other Mortgage Revenue Bonds The Company accounts for its investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other mortgage revenue bonds under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P31_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P31_S2	All of the Company s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P31_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P32_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P32_S1	As a result, the Company bases its estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P32_S2	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P32_S3	If available, management may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P32_S4	Pricing services, broker quotes and management s analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P33_S0	The Company periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P33_S1	The Company evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P34_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P35_S0	While the Company evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Company expects to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P35_S1	The ability to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P36_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serve as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P36_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property that serves as collateral on the bond and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P36_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P36_S3	The inputs to these models require management to make assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P37_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P38_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P39_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P39_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 4.3% and 7.5% which the Company believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P40_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P41_S0	Operating results from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P41_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of and demand for multifamily residential properties in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P41_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P42_S0	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P42_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, the Company believes that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bonds are considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S4	The difference between the amortized cost basis and the discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate represents the credit loss.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P43_S5	Any residual decline in value would be considered the interest related loss or non-credit loss.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P44_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P45_S0	If the Company experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P46_S0	The Company owns some mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P46_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in investment income in the current period.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Company eliminates the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P48_S0	When the Partnership invests in a mortgage revenue bond which is collateralized by a multifamily or student housing property, the Partnership will evaluate the entity which owns the property financed by the mortgage revenue bond to determine if it is a VIE as defined by the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P49_S0	The guidance on consolidations is a complex standard that requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P49_S1	If it is determined that the entity is a VIE, the Partnership will then evaluate if it is the primary beneficiary of such VIE, by determining whether the Partnership will absorb the majority of the VIE s expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE s residual returns, or both.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P49_S2	If the Partnership determines itself to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, then the assets, liabilities and financial results of the related multifamily or student housing property will be consolidated in the Partnership s financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P49_S3	As a result of such consolidation, the debt financing provided by the Partnership to such consolidated VIE will be eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P49_S4	However, the Partnership will continue to receive interest and principal payments on such debt and these payments will retain their characterization as either mortgage revenue bond or taxable interest for income tax reporting purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P50_S0	Since the Partnership has no legal ownership of the VIEs, creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P51_S0	Effective December 1, 2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity, a reconsideration event.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P51_S1	As a result of the change in ownership, Lake Forest ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE (Note 4).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Company accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates and MBS under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P52_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P52_S2	All of the Company s PHC Certificates and MBS investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P52_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P53_S0	There is no active trading market for the PHC Certificates and price quotes are not available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P54_S0	The estimates of the fair values of the PHC Certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P54_S1	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management s estimates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P55_S0	The Company periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P56_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P57_S0	The Company values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P57_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P57_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S2	The Company periodically reviews each MBS security for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S3	The Company evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Company s intent and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S4	Each MBS security has been rated either AAA or AA by either S P or Moody s.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P58_S5	A downgrade in rating for each MBS or new issuances of similar MBS with ratings by S P or Moody s below the A rating would be a factor in concluding that an impairment is other-than-temporary.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P59_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Company s investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P59_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19 - 40 years on multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P59_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Company also holds land held for investment and development which is reported at cost.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P60_S0	Management reviews each property and land held for investment and development for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P60_S1	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P61_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P62_S0	Taxable Property Loans In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Company, taxable property loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P62_S1	The repayment of these taxable property loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralize the loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Company periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralize the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any taxable property loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P63_S0	The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow model discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value we evaluate a number of different discounted cash flow ( DCF ) models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P63_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P63_S2	The Company may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P64_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P64_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P65_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P65_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized a provision for loan losses of approximately $75,000 and $168,000 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P65_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company did not recognize any provision for loan losses (Note 9).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P66_S0	Accounting for Tax Exempt Bond Securitization ( TEBS ) and Tender Option Bond ( TOB ) Financing Arrangements The Company has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the M31 and M24 TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (Note 11) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as a secured financing transactions.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P66_S1	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P66_S2	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P67_S0	An agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity, 2.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P67_S1	The ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a cleanup call, or 3.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P67_S2	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S0	The M31 and M24 TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2010 as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S2	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2014 as two specific dates, July 15, 2019 or July 15, 2024, on which the Company has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S3	Given these terms, the Company has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S4	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets resulting in the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing being presented on the Company s consolidated financial statements as a secured financing.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P68_S5	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Company to call the bonds held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the residual participating interests ( LIFERS ) so effective control has not been transferred resulting in the TOB Financings being presented on the Company s consolidated financial statements as secured financings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S0	In addition to evaluating the M31 and M24 TEBS Financings as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trusts associated with the TEBS Financing facilities (the M31 TEBS Trust and M24 TEBS Trust ) under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S1	As part of the M31 and M24 TEBS Financings, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts with Freddie Mac.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S2	The M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S3	Other Company investments are securitized into TOB Trusts with Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S4	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participating interests ( SPEARS ) and LIFERS.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S5	The Partnership has determined that the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts are VIEs and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P69_S6	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are VIEs and the LIFERS owned by the Company create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P70_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P71_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE s management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P71_S2	While in the M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trusts and the liabilities of the trusts do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P72_S1	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P73_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P73_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the M31 and M24 TEBS Financing facilities and the associated M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts are presented as secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P73_S2	The TOB Financings and associated TOB trusts are also presented as a secured financing within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P74_S0	The bond purchase commitments held by the Company have no cost.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P74_S1	However, they are required to be measured and recorded at fair value, which is estimated under the same methodology as the Company s mortgage revenue bonds in the Company s financial statements (Notes 5 and 17).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P75_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P75_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized on the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P75_S2	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $8.5 million and $5.3 million , respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P75_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of approximately $3.9 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P76_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership s taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P76_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P76_S2	At December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P76_S3	The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $8.5 million and $7.4 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S1	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S2	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S3	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond s ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S6	Past due contingent interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P77_S7	As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , the Company s mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P78_S0	An evaluation was performed during fiscal 2011 which determined that the interest receivable accrued on the Woodland Park bond was impaired and an approximate $953,000 allowance for loss on receivables was recorded.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P78_S1	The Partnership received two interest payments during 2012 and recorded an additional allowance of approximately $453,000 against the remaining interest receivable in 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P78_S2	The Partnership recorded an approximate additional $242,000 against the interest receivable before the mortgage revenue bond foreclosure was completed in May 2013 and title to the Woodland Park property was conveyed to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership (Note 8).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P79_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates The Partnership s Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (Note 8) are lessors of multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P79_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P80_S0	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned (Notes 6 and 7).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Company accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P81_S1	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P82_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P82_S1	The Company s interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P82_S2	The Company is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P82_S3	The Company does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P83_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P84_S0	Net Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P84_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P84_S2	The following table provides a reconciliation of net income per BUC holder:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P85_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P85_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P85_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P86_S0	The Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P86_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P86_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each unitholder as of such date.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P86_S3	For purposes of the Agreement of Limited Partnership, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (Note 8) will be included in the Partnership s Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P87_S0	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P87_S1	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage revenue bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P88_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs as of the date of the implementation of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P88_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P89_S0	The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 were as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P90_S0	Although Residential Properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are owned by separate entities in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P90_S1	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P91_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership determined that eleven of the entities financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P91_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree, Bruton Apartments, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks, Glenview Apartments, Harden Ranch, Montclair Apartments, Santa Fe Apartments, Tyler Park Apartments, and Westside Village Market.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P91_S2	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two of these VIEs; Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P92_S0	At December 31, 2013, the Partnership determined that six of the entities financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership were held by VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P92_S1	These VIEs were Ashley Square, Bent Tree Apartments, Cross Creek, Fairmont Oaks Apartments, Tyler Park, and Westside.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Partnership then determined that it is the primary beneficiary of two of these VIEs; Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks Apartments, and has continued to consolidate these entities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P92_S3	Effective December 1, 2013, the ownership of Lake Forest became a not-for-profit entity and Lake Forest ceased to be reported as a Consolidated VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P93_S0	Subsequent to the issuance of the Company s financial statements on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2013, the Company identified two non-consolidated VIEs, Tyler Park Townhomes and Westside Village Market, which should have been disclosed as VIEs at December 31, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P93_S1	This has been corrected in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P93_S2	The correction did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P94_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in the eleven VIEs and therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P95_S0	The primary risks to the Partnership associated with the eleven VIEs financed by mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership relate to the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying Residential Properties which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P96_S0	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P97_S0	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership determined it is the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P98_S0	The capital structure of Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs consists of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P98_S1	The senior debt is in the form of a mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the VIEs total capital.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P99_S0	As the bondholder, the Partnership is entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P100_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by four individuals, one of which is a related party.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P100_S1	Additionally, each of these properties is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, America First Properties Management Company, LLC ( Properties Management ) which is an affiliate of the Burlington Capital Group, LLC ( Burlington ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P101_S0	The Partnership lent the Exchange Accommodation Titleholder ( EAT (The Colonial, f/k/a Maples on 97th ) the necessary funds to purchase the The Colonial property and executed a Master Lease Agreement and Construction Management Agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P101_S1	These two agreements gave the Partnership the rights and obligations to manage the replacement property as well as the rehabilitation during the six month hold period.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P101_S2	The Partnership determined that it was the primary beneficiary of the EAT (The Colonial, f/k/a Maples on 97th).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P101_S3	Based on the terms of the Master Lease Agreement, the Partnership reported the rental income and related real estate operating expenses for the The Colonial property during the six month holding period (August 2012 to January 2013) as an MF Property since it has all the rights and obligations of landlord for the property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P101_S4	In February 2013, title to the The Colonial (f/k/a Maples on 97th) property transferred to the Partnership from the EAT (The Colonial, f/k/a Maples on 97th).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P102_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Partnership also considered the related party relationships of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P102_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P103_S0	The Company does not consolidate nine VIE entities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P103_S1	In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considered the activities of each VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P103_S2	The significant activities of the VIE that impact the economic performance of the entity include leasing and maintaining multifamily residential properties, determining if the property is to be sold, decisions relating to debt refinancing, the selection of or replacement of the property manager and the approval of the operating and capital budgets.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P103_S3	While the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P104_S0	The following table presents information regarding the classification of the assets at their carrying value and maximum exposure to loss held by the Partnership as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , which constitute variable interest entities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P105_S0	The following tables provide information about the two VIEs at December 31, 2014 and 2013 in the Partnership s financial statements under the provisions of the guidance on consolidations.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P105_S1	These schedules also include information on the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership which are eliminated in consolidation, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P105_S2	In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds detailed below, the Partnership has made taxable property loans to these consolidated VIEs of $7.4 million and $7.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P106_S0	The following tables present the effects of the consolidation of the VIEs on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P107_S0	As discussed above, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P107_S1	The cash flows from the VIEs do not represent cash flows available to the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P108_S0	Consolidating Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1059142_15_ITEM8_P109_S0	Consolidating Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 :
1059142_15_ITEM8_P110_S0	Each of the mortgage revenue bonds were issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P110_S1	However, the mortgage revenue bonds do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P110_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P110_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P110_S4	Each mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property and bears interest at a fixed rate and four of the mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable solely from available net cash flow generated by the financed property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P111_S0	The mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Company have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for the Residential Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P111_S1	The carrying value of each of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 is as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P112_S0	Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P112_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the weighted average base rate of the mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.0% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P112_S2	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P112_S3	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P113_S0	As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 , all of the Company s mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P114_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S0	The key assumption in management s yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 4.7% to 8.3% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 5.1% to 9.1% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $26.2 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P115_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and management s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on these mortgage revenue bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , two mortgage revenue bonds, Tyler Park B Bond and Westside Village B Bond, have been in an unrealized loss position for greater than twelve months.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S2	The Company has reviewed each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S3	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on these two bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S4	If yields on new issuance of investments increase, the Company experiences deterioration in the estimated fair values of its investment portfolio, or if the Company s intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Company may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P116_S5	The Company has the intent and ability to hold both of these mortgage revenue bonds until their stated maturity.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P117_S0	The Harden Ranch B mortgage revenue bond was purchased in 2014 so it has been in unrealized loss positions for less than twelve months.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P118_S0	The Company s ability to recover the mortgage revenue bonds entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P119_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P119_S1	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P119_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P119_S3	The revenue, expense, and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P120_S0	Recent Bond Activity In November 2014, the Partnership acquired six mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P121_S0	The Partnership purchased an approximate $4.7 million par value Series A and an approximate $2.0 million par value Series B mortgage revenue bonds.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S0	In July 2012, the Company purchased 100% of the LIFERs in the PHC TOB Trusts which acquired approximately $65.3 million of PHC Certificates issued by three trusts ( PHC Trusts ) sponsored by DB.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S1	The assets held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S3	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S4	The loans payable by the public housing authorities are not debts, nor guaranteed by the United States of America or HUD.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S5	Interest payable on the public housing authority debt held by the PHC Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P161_S6	The PHC Certificates issued by each of the PHC Trusts have been rated investment grade by Standard Poor s.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P162_S0	The Company purchased the LIFERS issued by the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Company as the holder of LIFERS.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P162_S2	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P162_S3	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after preferred return payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P163_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P164_S0	The Company determined that the three PHC TOB trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of the three PHC TOB trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P164_S1	As a result, the Company reports the PHC TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P165_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P166_S0	The indenture for the PHC TOB trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the PHC TOB trusts to sell the PHC Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P166_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the PHC Certificates fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P167_S0	The Company had the following investments in the PHC Certificates on December 31, 2014 and 2013:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P168_S0	Valuation - As all of the Company s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P168_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the weighted average base rate of the PHC Trust Certificates was approximately 5.0% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P168_S2	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Company would actually receive in a sale of the certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P168_S3	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates is based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants which includes adjustments for the fact that the PHC Certificates investment grade rating is below AAA .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S0	Management s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to Management s estimates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S1	The PHC Certificates are AA , A , and BBB rated and the range of effective yields was 4.2% to 5.4% per annum at December 31, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S2	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC Certificates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structure security.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S3	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC Certificates would increase to a range of 4.7% to 6.0% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.3 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S6	If available, the general partner may also consider other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S7	The most recent update on the annual appropriations from HUD disclosed no significant changes in the program which means the underlying performance of the PHC Certificates will be in line with expectations until the next annual update.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P169_S8	Further, there have been no downgrades in the investment grade rating of any of the three PHC Certificates noted since the investment was originally acquired in July 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P170_S0	The following table sets forth certain information relating to the PHC Certificates held in the PHC TOB Trusts:

1059142_15_ITEM8_P172_S1	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts, have been credit enhanced by DB and are recorded as debt financing in the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P172_S2	The LIFERS entitle the Company to all principal and interest payments received by the MBS TOB Trust on the securitized MBS after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P172_S3	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P173_S0	The Company determined that the six MBS TOB Trusts are variable interest entities and that the Company was the primary beneficiary of each of them.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P174_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Company considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P175_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the MBS TOB Trusts will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the MBS fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P175_S2	Interest earned on the MBS held by the six MBS TOB Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P176_S0	In May 2014, the Company sold a portion of the MBS TOB Trusts for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P176_S1	This approximately $3.7 million par value MBS had been acquired for approximately $3.8 million in November 2012 (Note 11).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P177_S0	In October 2014, the Company sold a portion of the MBS TOB Trusts for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P177_S1	The approximate $24.4 million par value of the MBS had been acquired for approximately $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 first half of 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P177_S2	The Company then collapsed the related MBS - TOB Trust 4 for approximately $6.0 million , MBS - TOB Trust 5 for approximately $5.3 million and MBS - TOB Trust 6 for approximately $7.8 million securitizing the related MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P177_S3	The Company s approximate $19.1 million TOB financing facilities, which were the securitization of this MBS TOB Trusts, were paid off in full in connection with this sale (Note 11).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P178_S0	The carrying value of the Company s MBS as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P179_S0	(1) MBS are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P180_S0	(1) MBS are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P181_S0	Valuation - The Company values each MBS based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P181_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P181_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P182_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P182_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P182_S2	At December 31, 2014, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS was 3.7% to 5.2% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P182_S3	Additionally, the Company calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P182_S4	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS would increase to a range of 4.1% to 5.8% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $806,000 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P183_S0	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P183_S1	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P183_S2	Pricing services and management s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P183_S3	Certain of the MBS have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months and management has concluded that there is no other-than-temporary impairment to record as the Company has the intent and ability to hold on to the MBS until either the estimated fair value rebounds or until maturity.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P183_S4	In addition, there have been no downgrades to the investment grade rating levels of the MBS since their original acquisition dates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P184_S0	The MBS are backed by residential mortgage loans and interest payable from the MBS is believed and expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P197_S1	Although the assets of the VIEs are consolidated, the Company has no ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs other than to the extent they serve as collateral for the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P197_S2	The results of operations of those properties are recorded by the Company in consolidation but any net income or loss from these properties does not accrue to the unitholders or the general partner, but is instead included in Unallocated deficit of variable interest entities.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P201_S1	The Company periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable property loans for impairment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P201_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable property loan values.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P202_S0	The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P202_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P202_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P203_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 2 above except the discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was approximately 5.8% to 7.0% .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P203_S1	The Company believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property could obtain current financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P203_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P203_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principle balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P204_S0	In June 2014, the Company restructured twelve mortgage revenue bonds related to Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, and Avistar in 09 Apartments purchased in June and February 2013 (Note 4).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P204_S1	In connection with the mortgage revenue bond restructuring the Company loaned these entities approximately $526,000 to cover the costs of restructuring the mortgage revenue bonds.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P210_S0	The following is a summary of the taxable loans, accrued interest and allowance on amounts due at December 31, 2014 and 2013 :
1059142_15_ITEM8_P211_S0	The Partnership received the Sheriff s deed conveying title of Woodland Park to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership on May 29, 2013.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P215_S2	During 2013, the Partnership recorded loan loss reserves equal to the accrued interest on the Ashley Square, Cross Creek, Greens and the Ohio Properties taxable property loans receivable because the Partnership has determined they are not reasonably assured.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P216_S0	Based on the annual impairment analysis, a provision for loan loss and an associated loan loss reserve of $75,000 and $168,000 was recorded against the Cross Creek taxable property loan in the 2014 and 2013, respectively.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P219_S0	Accrued interest not recognized represents interest accrued that the Partnership has determined they are not reasonably assured of collecting.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P219_S1	During 2014, the Partnership recorded loan loss reserves equal to the accrued interest on the Ashley Square, Cross Creek, Lake Forest, and the Ohio Properties loans.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P219_S3	During 2012, the Partnership recorded loan loss reserves equal to the accrued interest on the Ashley Square, Cross Creek, Iona Lakes and Woodland Park property loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P220_S0	The Company, at December 31, 2013, reported an asset held for sale valued at an appraised value of $375,000 , along with a receivable of approximately $711,000 representing amounts due from a project owner of Prairiebrook Village.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P221_S2	In 2009, the Company recorded a $700,000 provision for loan loss reserve against this judgment receivable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P221_S3	In February 2010, the Company was informed that bankruptcy protection may be sought by the judgment party.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P221_S4	This reserve is $711,000 at December 31, 2014 and 2013 , while the Company continues to pursue this receivable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P221_S5	The $375,000 asset is land held as an investment for future development and reported with the Real Estate Assets on December 31, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S0	In June 2010, the Company completed a sales transaction whereby the Ohio Properties were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity and in October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S1	The BC Partners agreed to contribute equity to these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S2	As such, there was not sufficient equity invested at closing by the not-for-profit or BC Partners into the Ohio Properties to allow the Company to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S3	During the first quarter of 2013, BC Partners contributed $6.5 million of capital into the Ohio Properties which was sufficient to allow the Company to recognize the sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S4	This gain on sale of discontinued operations was approximately $1.8 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P222_S5	The sale of this discontinued operation allowed the Company to begin reporting the mortgage revenue bonds related to the Ohio Properties as assets beginning with the March 31, 2013 consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S0	The deposit method of accounting for real estate sales required both the deferral of the gain from the real estate sale and also did not allow recognition of the interest payments by the Ohio Properties to the Company between June 2010 and the date of the equity contribution by BC Partners.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S1	In conjunction with the recognition of the real estate sale, approximately $3.5 million of interest has been recognized within investment income during 2013 which represents the interest payments received from the Ohio Properties between June 2010 and December 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S2	In addition, the Partnership reported approximately $1.1 million in taxable note interest income received from the Ohio Properties and $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner of the Ohio Properties during the first quarter of 2013 (Note 2).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S3	The net fixed assets and total assets of the Ohio Properties were zero at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S4	The deposit method of accounting also deferred the recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties and the purchase of the mortgage revenue bonds they secure in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P223_S5	As such, these transactions are being recognized in the consolidated statement of cash flows in the year ending December 31, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P224_S0	In October 2012, the limited partnership that owns the Greens Property admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Greens Property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P224_S1	Prior to the execution of the admittance of the new limited partners, the Company had entered into an agreement to sell the Greens Property for approximately $7.3 million to an unaffiliated not-for-profit which is the general partner of the limited partnership that now owns the Greens Property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P224_S2	That sale was conditional on securing the mortgage revenue bond and low-income housing tax credits from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P224_S3	The $961,000 BC Partners equity contribution made into this limited partnership in October 2012 was not sufficient to allow the Company to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P224_S4	In July 2013, BC Partners made their required $800,000 capital contribution into the Greens Property as construction was 75% complete.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P225_S0	The Company purchased 100% of the mortgage revenue bonds issued as part of the agreement to finance the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Greens Property.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P259_S7	The approximate $6.3 million is reported as restricted cash on the December 31, 2014 balance sheet.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P260_S1	As of closing, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.04% per annum and the total Facility Fees were approximately 1.4% per annum, resulting in a total initial cost of borrowing of approximately 1.5% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P260_S2	In order to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate M31 TEBS Financing, the 2014 Sponsor also entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.6 million , which effectively limits the interest payable by the 2014 Sponsor on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 15, 2019 .

1059142_15_ITEM8_P261_S4	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the 2014 Sponsor on the Class B M31 TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses, and other factors.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P262_S0	Freddie Mac guaranteed payment of scheduled principal and interest payments on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates and also guaranteed payment of the purchase price of any Class A M31 TEBS Certificates that are tendered to Freddie Mac in accordance with their terms which cannot be remarketed to new holders within five business days.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P262_S1	The 2014 Sponsor is obligated to reimburse Freddie Mac for certain expenses, including any payments made by Freddie Mac under its guaranty.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P262_S2	These obligations of the 2014 Sponsor are also guaranteed by the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P263_S0	The Partnership also entered into various subordination agreements with Freddie Mac under which the Partnership has subordinated its rights and remedies with respect to the mortgage revenue and taxable bonds and taxable mortgage loans made by it to the owners of properties securing certain of the Bonds to the rights of Freddie Mac as the holder of the Bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P264_S0	The term of the M31 TEBS Financing coincides with the terms of the assets securing the M31 TEBS Certificates, except the 2014 Sponsor may elect to purchase all (but not less than all) of the Bonds from Freddie Mac on either July 15, 2019 or July 15, 2024.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P264_S1	The 2014 Sponsor also retains a right to require a Bond to be released from Freddie Mac in the event of a payment default on the Bond which remains uncured for two consecutive scheduled payment dates or 60 days, whichever is shorter, by paying Freddie Mac the unpaid principal and accrued interest on the Bond plus a yield maintenance payment.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P264_S2	In addition, the 2014 Sponsor has a limited right to substitute new bonds for existing Bonds held by Freddie Mac in certain circumstances.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P264_S3	Should the Partnership not elect to terminate the TEBS Financing on these dates the full term of the M31 TEBS Financing runs through the final principal payment date associated with the securitized bonds, or August 1, 2050.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P265_S0	As of September 1, 2010, the Partnership and its Consolidated Subsidiary ATAX TEBS I, LLC, entered into a number of agreements relating to a new long-term debt financing facility provided through the securitization of thirteen mortgage revenue bonds owned by the ATAX TEBS I, LLC (the 2010 Sponsor ) pursuant to the M24 TEBS Financing.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P265_S1	The M24 TEBS Financing facility essentially provides the Partnership with a long-term variable-rate debt facility at interest rates reflecting prevailing short-term tax-exempt rates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P266_S0	Effective September 1, 2010, the Partnership transferred the following mortgage revenue bonds to ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity controlled by the Partnership pursuant to the M24 TEBS Financing.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P267_S1	The Class A TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $95.8 million and were sold through a placement agent to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P267_S2	The Class B TEBS Certificates were issued in an initial principal amount of $20.3 million and were retained by the Sponsor.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P267_S3	The holders of the Class A TEBS Certificates are entitled to receive regular payments of interest from Freddie Mac at a variable rate which resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index rate plus Facility Fees.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P267_S4	As of December 31, 2014 , the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.1% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 2.0% per annum on the outstanding balance on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of $76.4 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P267_S5	As of December 31, 2013, the SIFMA rate was equal to 0.1% per annum resulting in a total cost of borrowing of approximately 2.0% per annum on the outstanding balance on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of $93.0 million .

1059142_15_ITEM8_P268_S0	Payment of interest on the Class A TEBS Certificates will be made from the interest payments received by Freddie Mac from the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac on designated interest payment dates prior to any payments of interest on the Class B TEBS Certificates held by the Sponsor.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P268_S1	As the holder of the Class B TEBS Certificates, the Sponsor is not entitled to receive interest payments on the Class B TEBS Certificates at any particular rate, but will be entitled to all payments of principal and interest on the Bonds and Senior Custody Receipts held by Freddie Mac after payment of principal and interest due on the Class A TEBS Certificates and payment of all Facility Fees and associated expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P268_S2	Accordingly, the amount of interest paid to the Sponsor on the Class B TEBS Certificates is expected to vary over time, and could be eliminated altogether, due to fluctuations in the interest rate payable on the Class A TEBS Certificates, Facility Fees, expenses and other factors.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P268_S3	The term of the M24 TEBS Financing facility coincides with the terms of the assets securing the TEBS Certificates, except that the Partnership may terminate the M24 TEBS Financing facility at its option on either September 15, 2017 or September 15, 2020.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P268_S4	Should the Partnership not elect to terminate the M24 TEBS Financing facility on these dates, the full term of the M24 TEBS Financing facility runs through the final principal payment date associated with the securitized bonds, or July 15, 2050.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P271_S0	The Partnership s strategic objective is to leverage its bond portfolio utilizing long term securitization financings with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P271_S1	This strategy allows the Partnership to better match the duration of its assets and liabilities and to lock in a spread between its assets and liabilities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P271_S2	The Partnership intends to refinance all of its maturing short term debt obligations with the proceeds of at least one additional TEBS financing.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P281_S2	Should a mortgage loan reach maturity prior to a sale of the associated MF Property, the Partnership would either seek to refinance such mortgage loan or utilize cash reserves to retire the loan.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P281_S3	The Partnership expects to provide mortgage revenue bonds as part of an overall plan of financing the acquisition of a MF Property by a new property owner.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P284_S2	The amounts in the following table represent cash payments to reimburse AFCA 2 or an affiliate for such expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S0	AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any of its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable loans collateralized by real property, and other investments for which the owner of the financed property or other third party is not obligated to pay such administrative fee directly to AFCA 2.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $138,000 , $144,000 , and $133,000 , in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S4	Additionally, in connection with the sale of Eagle Ridge, the property paid accrued and deferred administrative fees to AFCA2 totaling approximately $71,000 in 2012.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S5	Although these third party administrative fees are not Partnership expenses, they have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of the consolidation of the VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S6	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P285_S7	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P286_S0	AFCA 2 earns mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds by the Company.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P286_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P289_S4	For the MF Properties, these management fees are considered real estate operating expenses.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P290_S0	An affiliate of AFCA 2 acts as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when mortgage revenue bonds and financing facilities are acquired by the Company.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P292_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company has nine derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P292_S1	In addition, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps during 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P292_S2	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P293_S0	In July 2014, to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate M31 TEBS Financing, the Company entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.6 million , which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 15, 2019 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P293_S1	The interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $991,000 and do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P293_S2	Therefore, changes in the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives are included in earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P294_S0	In February 2014, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements with SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. for a notional amount of $70.0 million with an effective start date of March 1, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P294_S1	These agreements effectively limit the interest component of the TOB financing correlated with the SIFMA index to a maximum of 1.0% on $70.0 million of the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities and the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities through a three year term ending March 1, 2017 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P294_S2	These interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $390,000 and do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P294_S3	Therefore, changes in the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives are included in earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S0	In July 2013, the Company purchased a new interest rate derivative with a notional amount of $93.3 million which represents the amount outstanding on the M24 TEBS Financing facility at August 1, 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S1	The maturity date of this interest rate derivative is September 1, 2017 and the effective capped interest rate is 1.5% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S2	On July 30, 2013, the Company also sold a new interest rate derivative to the same counterparty which had the same notional amount of $93.3 million and an effective capped interest rate of 3.0% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S3	The total cost of these two interest rate derivatives was approximately $800,000 and the derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, therefore, changes in the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives are included in earnings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S4	This interest rate corridor transaction effectively reduced the capped interest rate from 3.0% to 1.5% per annum on the M24 TEBS Financing facility through the maturity date of the interest rate derivative contracts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S5	In August 2013, the Company executed a master netting agreement with DB, which is the counterparty to these interest rate derivative contracts and is also the provider of the Company s TOB financing facilities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S6	The Company was refunded $500,000 of posted cash collateral on the TOB financing facilities back upon the execution of this master netting agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P295_S7	There are no amounts reported on a net basis related to the Company s interest rate derivative contracts as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P296_S0	The Company had previously entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of New York Mellon and Royal Bank of Canada, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.9 million which effectively limits the interest payable by the Company on the M24 TEBS Financing facility to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 2017.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P296_S1	The interest rate cap plus the Facility Fees payable to Freddie Mac result in a maximum potential cost of borrowing on the M24 TEBS Financing facility of 4.9% per annum.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P297_S0	In September 2014, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with Deutsche Bank AG for a variable notional amount with effective dates of October 15, 2016 and April 15, 2017.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P297_S1	The notional amount and effective dates of these instruments will approximate the amounts invested in and timing of the completion of construction of the properties which collateralize the Decatur Angle and Bruton Apartments bonds, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P297_S2	These agreements swap the fixed rate per the bond agreement to a LIBOR based floating interest rate upon completion of construction of the underlying properties for a five year term from the respective effective date.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P297_S3	These interest rate swaps had no cost to the Company and do not qualify for hedge accounting.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P298_S0	There is no exchange of cash flows prior to the effective dates of the agreements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P299_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P299_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $2.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 , as compared to an increase of approximately $284,000 in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P300_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P300_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $268,000 and $888,000 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P301_S0	Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P302_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P303_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P304_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P304_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P305_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P306_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P307_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P308_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P309_S0	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P310_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P310_S1	The fair values of the Company s investments in mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P311_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P311_S1	If available, the General Partner may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P311_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P311_S3	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P312_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Company s investments in mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P312_S1	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P312_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P313_S0	The key inputs and methodology for determining the fair value of the forward bond purchase commitments are consistent with those used in determining the fair value of Investments in mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P313_S1	The fair market value of the Company s investment in forward bond purchase commitments is an asset reported in Other Assets of approximately $10.6 million and a liability of approximately $4.9 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P313_S2	The estimated fair market value adjustments related to forward bond purchase commitments are categorized as Level 3 inputs which were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P314_S0	Investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P314_S1	The fair value of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the General Partner.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P314_S2	There is no active trading market for the trusts certificates owned by the Company but the General Partner will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P314_S3	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P314_S4	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P315_S0	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with similar length of terms.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P315_S1	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P316_S0	The fair value of the Company s investment in mortgage-backed securities is based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P316_S1	The valuation methodology of the Company s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P316_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P317_S0	Management analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Company estimates as 7.5% .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P317_S1	Management also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P317_S2	Given these facts, the fair value measurements of the Company s investment in mortgage-backed securities is categorized as Level 2 input.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P318_S0	The fair values of the Company s investments in taxable bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P318_S1	There is no active trading market for the taxable bonds and price quotes are not available.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P319_S0	The estimates of the fair values of these taxable bonds, whether estimated by the Company or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the General Partner believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P319_S1	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Company encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P320_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Company s investments in taxable bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P320_S1	We validate that the changes in the estimated fair value of the taxable bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P320_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Company s investment in taxable bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P321_S0	The effect of the Company s interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Company s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P321_S1	The effect of the Company s interest rate swap is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P321_S2	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P321_S3	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P321_S4	The inputs in the valuation model include three-month LIBOR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P322_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_15_ITEM8_P323_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P324_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value given the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P324_S1	The Company calculates a fair market value of each financial instrument using a discounted cash flow model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for 2013.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P324_S2	The estimated fair value of the Debt financing and Mortgages payable are in the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P324_S3	Below represents the fair market value of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P325_S0	The Company, from time to time, may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P325_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P326_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P326_S1	While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P327_S0	Certain of the MF Properties own multifamily residential properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous partners in these partnerships.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P327_S1	In connection with the acquisition of partnership interests in these partnerships by subsidiaries of the Company, the Company has agreed to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to recapture of these tax credits to the extent the recapture liability is due to the operation of the properties in a manner inconsistent with the laws and regulations relating to such tax credits after the date of acquisition.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P327_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because management believes that the likelihood of any payments being required there under is remote.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P328_S0	In December 2014, the Partnership entered into a Forward Delivery Bond Purchase Agreement ( Bond Purchase Commitment ) to purchase an approximately up to $20.0 million new mortgage revenue bond secured by a multifamily residential property, Villas at Plano Gateway Senior Living Apartments, under construction in Plano, Texas.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P328_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P329_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records any changes in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P329_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership has estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $1.1 million .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P330_S0	In July 2014, the Partnership entered into a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase up to approximately $9.9 million new mortgage revenue bond secured by a multifamily residential property, 15 West Apartments, under construction in Vancouver, Washington.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P330_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.25% and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P331_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and records any changes in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P331_S1	At December 31, 2014 , the Partnership has estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets an asset of approximately $809,000 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P332_S0	At December 31, 2014,the Partnership has two other Forward Bond Purchase Commitments (Vantage at Judson and Vantage at Harlingen) which are discussed in footnote 5.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P333_S0	The Company provided a guarantee on the $2.8 million mortgage obtained on the Abbington at Stones River, a 96 unit multifamily residential property located in Tennessee in addition to providing an approximately $1.6 million taxable property loan to Foundation for Affordable Housing, the not-for-profit owner of the property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P333_S1	Based on the historical financial performance of the property and its estimated fair value, the Company estimates there is no value to record for this mortgage guarantee.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P334_S0	In connection with the sale of the Greens Property, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of the Greens of Pine Glen limited partnership, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P334_S1	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P334_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P334_S3	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2014 , under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $1.3 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners to date.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P335_S0	In connection with the Ohio Properties transaction in 2011, the Company entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Company has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P336_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P336_S1	Even if a repurchase event should occur, 25% of the BC equity would remain in the Ohio Properties and thus BC, a third party, would have sufficient equity in the Ohio Properties for the Company to recognize the sale discussed in Note 9.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P336_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P336_S3	The maximum exposure to the Company at December 31, 2014 , under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $4.9 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P337_S0	In June 2013, the Partnership executed a Bond Purchase Commitment agreeing to purchase an $8.0 million new mortgage revenue bond and a $500,000 taxable bond both secured by a multifamily residential property under construction, Silver Moon, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P337_S1	The mortgage revenue bond will have a stated annual interest rate of 6.0% per annum, the taxable bond will have a stated rate of 12.0% per annum, and bond proceeds must be used to pay off the third party construction loan.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P338_S0	The Partnership accounts for the Bond Purchase Commitment as an available-for-sale security and, as such, records the change in estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitment as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P338_S1	As of December 31, 2014 , the Partnership has estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded in other assets approximately $414,000 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P338_S2	As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership estimated the value of this Bond Purchase Commitment and recorded a liability of approximately $600,000 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P339_S0	The Partnership has also executed a Guarantee Agreement with the construction lender for Silver Moon.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P339_S1	The terms of the Guarantee Agreement requires the Partnership to guarantee that all construction costs are paid when due and pay any remaining outstanding principal and unpaid interest on the construction loan on or before July 1, 2015.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P339_S2	Construction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015 when the Partnership anticipates purchasing the mortgage revenue bond and taxable bond.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P339_S3	No amounts have been accrued for this Guarantee Agreement as the Partnership expects that the construction loan will be sufficient to pay all costs during the construction period and that the proceeds from the mortgage revenue bond, taxable bond, and third party equity contribution to be sufficient to pay off all outstanding principal and interest on the construction loan on or before July 1, 2015.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P340_S0	As the holder of residual interests issued in connection with its TEBS and TOB bond financing arrangements, the Partnership is required to guarantee certain losses that can be incurred by the trusts created in connection with these financings.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P340_S1	These guarantees may result from a downgrade in the investment rating of mortgage revenue bonds held by the trust or of the senior securities issued by the trust, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates beyond pre-set maximums, an inability to re-market the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P340_S2	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P340_S3	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts, the Partnership will be required to fund any such shortfall pursuant to its guarantee.

1059142_15_ITEM8_P344_S1	These mortgage revenue bonds are secured by Concord at Williamcrest Apartments, an 288 unit multifamily residential property in Houston, Texas.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P345_S0	These three Series A mortgage revenue bonds each carry an annual interest rate of 6.00% and mature on February 1, 2032 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P345_S1	The three Series B mortgage revenue bonds each carry an annual interest rate of 12.0% maturing on March 1, 2032 .

1059142_15_ITEM8_P346_S1	Each TOB Trust facility has an approximate 2.8% per annum fixed interest rate and each will mature on February 19, 2018 .
1059142_15_ITEM8_P346_S2	Pursuant to the terms of this TOB trust the Partnership is required to reimburse DB for any shortfall realized on the contractual cash flows on the SPEARS.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P347_S0	In February 2015, the Partnership posted $6.6 million to restricted cash to comply with the Master Trust Agreement with DB.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P348_S0	In August 2014, the FASB issued a new financial accounting standard on going concern, Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Sub-Topic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P348_S1	The standard provides guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about the organization s ability to continue as a going concern.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P348_S2	The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P348_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P349_S0	ASU 2014-08 changes the definition of a discontinued operation to include only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P349_S1	In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires additional disclosures about both discontinued operations and the disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations presentation in the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P349_S2	The guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P349_S3	We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P350_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P350_S1	ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P351_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P351_S1	This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P351_S2	We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P352_S0	In January 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-04, Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P352_S1	This ASU applies to all creditors who obtain physical possession (resulting from an in substance repossession or foreclosure) of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan in satisfaction of a receivable.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P352_S2	The ASU clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon either (i) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (ii) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P352_S3	Additionally, the amendments require interim and annual disclosure of both (i) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (ii) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P353_S0	ASU 2014-04 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P353_S1	We are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P354_S0	The Company consists of five reportable segments, Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS Investments, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P354_S1	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P355_S0	The Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment consists of the Company s portfolio of federally mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for the Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P355_S1	Such mortgage revenue bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P355_S2	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company held fifty-three mortgage revenue bonds not associated with Consolidated VIEs and two mortgage revenue bonds associated with Consolidated VIEs which are bonds that are eliminated in consolidation on the Company s financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P355_S3	The Residential Properties financed by the 50 mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 6,527 rental units.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P355_S4	Three of the bonds properties are not operational and are under construction and two bonds are collateralized by commercial real estate (Note 5).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P356_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential properties which are not currently financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P356_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P356_S2	With the exception of the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property, the Partnership s interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P356_S3	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property are reported as discontinued operations in 2013 (Note 10).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P357_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in an MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P357_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership s CAD.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P358_S0	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company consolidated the results of nine MF Properties containing a total of 2,163 rental units (Note 8).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P359_S0	Other Investments The Partnership Agreement authorizes the Company to make investments in investments other than mortgage revenue bonds provided that these other investments are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency and do not constitute more than 25% of the Company s assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Agreement of Limited Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P359_S1	In addition, the amount of other investments are limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon for the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P359_S2	The Company currently has other investments, PHC Certificates and MBS which are reported as two separate segments.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P360_S0	The PHC Trusts segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the PHC Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P360_S1	The Partnership consolidates the PHC Trusts due to its ownership of the LIFERS issued by the three PHC Trusts, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of local public housing authorities.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P360_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Capital Fund Program.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P360_S3	This investment has been reported as part of the Partnership balance sheet and results of operations since acquired in July 2012 (Note 6).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P361_S0	The MBS segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the MBS TOB Trusts that the Company consolidated due to its ownership of the LIFERs issued by the MBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P361_S1	These MBS TOB Trusts are securitizations of state-issued mortgage-backed securities which are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P361_S2	These investments were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 through the second quarter of 2013 and all but three MBS were sold in 2014 (Note 7).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P362_S0	Consolidated VIE segment The Consolidated VIE segment consists of multifamily residential properties which are financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P362_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds on these Consolidated VIE properties are eliminated from the Company s financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds are held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P362_S2	The Company does not actually own an equity position in the Consolidated VIEs or their underlying properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P362_S3	As of December 31, 2014 , the Company consolidated two VIE multifamily residential properties containing a total of 410 rental units (Note 4).
1059142_15_ITEM8_P363_S0	Management closely monitors and evaluates the financial reporting associated with and the operations of the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties and performs such evaluation separately from the other operations of the Partnership through interaction with the affiliated property management company which manages the multifamily residential properties held by the Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P364_S0	Management s goals with respect to the properties constituting the Company s Consolidated VIE and MF Properties reportable segments is to generate increasing amounts of net rental income from these properties that will allow them to (i) make all payments of base interest, and possibly pay contingent interest, on the properties included in the Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment and the Consolidated VIE segment, and (ii) distribute net rental income to the Partnership from the MF Properties segment until such properties can be refinanced with additional mortgage revenue bonds meeting the Partnership s investment criteria.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P364_S1	In order to achieve these goals, management of these multifamily residential properties is focused on: (i) maintaining high economic occupancy and increasing rental rates through effective leasing, reduced turnover rates and providing quality maintenance and services to maximize resident satisfaction; (ii) managing operating expenses and achieving cost reductions through operating efficiencies and economies of scale generally inherent in the management of a portfolio of multiple properties; and (iii) emphasizing regular programs of repairs, maintenance and property improvements to enhance the competitive advantage and value of its properties in their respective market areas.
1059142_15_ITEM8_P365_S0	The following table details certain key financial information for the Company s reportable segments for the three years ended December 31:

1059142_15_ITEM9A_P0_S2	Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P1_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P1_S1	The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have determined that there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P2_S0	The Company s management (including officers of the Burlington Capital Group LLC in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of The Burlington Capital Group LLC (in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership), of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P2_S2	The Company s management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P2_S3	Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014 .
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P3_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 , has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P4_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P4_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P4_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P5_S0	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P5_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P5_S2	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P5_S3	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P6_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P6_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P7_S0	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P8_S0	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_15_ITEM9A_P9_S0	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 of the Company and our report dated March 5, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules.

1059142_16_ITEM1_P0_S0	We have been in operation since 1998 and own 64 mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $534.7 million as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P0_S1	The majority of these bonds were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 44 Residential Properties containing a total of 8,041 rental units located in the states of California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S0	under construction and two bonds are collateralized by commercial real estate located in Tennessee.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S1	Sixty-two of the mortgage revenue bonds are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on the Residential Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S2	Two mortgage revenue bonds are secured by ground, facility, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S3	Each of the bonds provides for base interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S4	Additionally, the bonds may also provide for the payment of contingent interest d etermined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P1_S5	As a result, these mortgage revenue bonds provide us with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed prop erties, either through operations or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P2_S0	Financing with Freddie Mac and 10 are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) in Tender Option Bond ( TOB ) facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P2_S1	See Notes 2 and 12 to the Comp any s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize our mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net operating income generated by these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net operating income from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P6_S0	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P6_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties which collateralize the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S0	The return we realize from our investments in mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize these bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S1	We may be considered to be in competition with other residential rental properties and commercial properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S2	We may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by the America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015 (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ) and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S3	Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, any tax-exempt investments, other than mortgage revenue bonds, that are not secured by a direct or indirect interest in a property must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S4	The acquisition by the Partnership of any tax-exempt investment or other investment may not cause the aggregate book value of such investments to exceed 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P7_S5	In addition, the Amended and Restated LP Agreement requires management to assess and conclude whether the income from these other securities is exempt from inclusion in income for federal taxation purposes at the time of purchase.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P8_S0	At December 31, 2015, we had two other classes of investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts Certificates ( PHC Certificates ) and mortgage-backed securities ( MBS Securities ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P8_S1	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate principal outstanding of $58.3 million at December 31, 2015 and are securitized into three separate TOB financing facilities ( TOB Trusts ) with DB ( PHC Trusts ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P8_S2	See Note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S0	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S2	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S3	The state issued MBS Securities had an aggregate principal outstanding of $14.8 million at December 31, 2015 and have been securitized into three separate TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S4	The MBS Securities are backed by residential mortgage loans and have investment grade ratings by the most recent S P or Moody s rating.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S5	We may also make taxable property loans secured by the Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S6	We do this in order to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in our best long-term interest.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S7	We may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position ourselves for future investments in bonds issued to finance these properties and which we expect and believe will generate tax-exempt interest.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S8	We currently hold interests in eight MF Properties containing 2,217 rental units, of which two are located in Nebraska, one in Kansas, one in Kentucky, one in Indiana, one in California, and two in Texas.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P9_S9	In addition, we may acquire real estate securing our mortgage revenue bonds or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S0	To restructure each of the MF Properties into a mortgage revenue bond, we team with a third party developer who works to secure a mortgage revenue bond issuance from the local housing authority.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S1	Once the developer receives the mortgage revenue b ond commitment, we will sell the MF Property to a not-for-profit entity or to a for profit entity in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S2	We expect to acqui re the mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S3	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of our initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S4	We will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S5	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mort gage revenue bond, we will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what we believe is its optimal fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S6	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC or other developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P10_S7	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for us and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S0	Effective in the second quarter of 2015, the property owners entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S1	As a result, these entities met the criteria for discontinued operations and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S2	As a result, the Company s consolidated financial statements for 2015 and 2014 consist of four reportable segments: Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, and MBS Securities Investments.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S3	The Company s consolidated financial statements for 2013 consist of these four reportable segments plus a Consolidated VIE segment which included Lake Forest.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S4	In addition to the reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P11_S5	See Notes 2, 4, 8, 10, 21, and 22 to the Company consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S0	Seven of the 44 Residential Properties which collateralize the bonds owned by us are managed by America First Properties Management Company, L.L.C. ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership s general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or the General Partner ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S1	In this regard, Properties Management provides property management services for Ashley Square, Lake Forest Apartments, Cross Creek, Greens of Pine Glen, (the Greens Property ) Crescent Village, Willow Bend and Post Woods (collectively, the Ohio Properties ), and each of the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to us and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC relating to these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S3	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital, (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our Unitholders which we expect and believe are substantially exempt from federal income tax, and (iii) generate additional returns from appreciation of real estate or the opportunistic sale of the asset investments.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S4	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S5	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed multifamily residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P12_S6	We expect and believe that any contingent interest we receive will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P13_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our Unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P13_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P13_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, lines of credit, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P13_S3	Our current operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage which will not exceed 65% of the total Partnership assets.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P14_S0	The assets are defined as the par value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS Securities, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P14_S1	See the discussion of financing arrangements and liquidity and capital resources in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
1059142_16_ITEM1_P15_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P15_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P16_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected mortgage revenue bonds that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P17_S0	payment of contingent interest on our bond investment.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P17_S1	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P17_S2	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P17_S3	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, student housing projects, housing for senior citizens, and commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P17_S4	The four basic types of mortgage revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM1_P18_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P18_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with mortgage revenue bonds that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P18_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the multifamily residential project may be rented at market rates (unless otherwise restricted by local housing authorities).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds that were secured by Residential Properties issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S2	There are no Treasury Regulations related to the mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by the commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S3	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed multifamily residential project.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S4	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S5	We expect to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P19_S6	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P20_S0	Investment Types Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_16_ITEM1_P20_S1	We invest in mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P20_S2	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P20_S3	Two of the mortgage revenue bonds currently owned by us also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying multifamily residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P20_S4	As a result, the amount of interest earned by us from our investment in mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net operating income generated by the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P21_S0	Net operating income from a residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P21_S1	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P22_S0	We may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P22_S1	These securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and may not represent more than 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S0	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S2	The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S3	The PHC Certificates rating by Standard Poor s is investment grade as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S4	We also invest in state-issued MBS Securities that are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P23_S5	These MBS Securities are rated investment grade by Standard Poor s or Moody s as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P24_S0	Partnership sold all of its MBS Securities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P24_S1	See Notes 7 and 19 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P25_S0	We may also make taxable property loans secured by Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds that are held by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P25_S1	As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties to position ourselves for a future investment in mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such MF Properties by a new owner.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P25_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new mortgage revenue bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S0	We may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S1	After the LIHTC compliance period, we would expect to sell our interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek mortgage revenue bond financing on the MF Property which we could acquire.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S2	We will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S3	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, we will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what we believe is our optimal fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S4	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC or other developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P26_S5	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for us and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P27_S0	Investment Opportunities and Business Challenges There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential housing in the United States.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P27_S1	HUD reports that there is a high demand for quality affordable housing.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P27_S2	The types of mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P27_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P28_S0	The demand for affordable housing by qualified potential residents whose income does not exceed 50-60% of the area median income continues to increase.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P28_S1	Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents has not kept up with the demand, therefore programs that support private sector development and support for affordable housing through mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits and grant funding to developers have become more prominent.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P29_S0	In addition to mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing through the use of LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P29_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with mortgage revenue bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P29_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P30_S0	We do not invest in LIHTCs, but are attracted to mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P31_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P31_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 60% or less of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by individuals whose income is 50% or less of the area median gross income.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P31_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S0	Economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that we use to partially finance our investment portfolio or otherwise meet our liquidity requirements.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S1	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S2	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S3	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S4	National economic conditions, including sluggish job and income growth and low home mortgage interest rates, may also have a negative effect on some of the Residential Properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S5	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the period) will result in lower economic occupancy.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S6	The overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the stabilized Residential Properties that we have financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 90% during 2015 and 91% during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P32_S7	The economic occupancy of the stabilized MF Properties has increased to approximately 90% during 2015 as compared to 87% during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S0	Financing Arrangements We may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds or other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, lines of credit, or with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds or other investments, including the securitization of these bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S1	We utilize leverage to enhance investor returns.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S2	We use target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us to manage an overall 65% leverage constraint.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S3	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S4	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 65%.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P33_S5	Our overall leverage constraint, total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the carrying value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS Securities, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost, was approximately 65%, as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P34_S0	There were no issuances of additional beneficial unit certificates ( BUCs ) in 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P34_S1	For additional details, see Note 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P35_S0	Recent Developments The following table presents information regarding the investment activity of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM1_P36_S0	(1) See Item 7, "Cash Available for Distribution" section of the Company's report.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P37_S0	The following table presents information regarding the financing activities of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM1_P38_S0	(1) See Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" section of the Company's report.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P39_S0	Management and Employees We are managed by our General Partner which is controlled by its general partner, the Burlington Capital Group LLC ( Burlington ).
1059142_16_ITEM1_P39_S1	The persons acting as the Board of Managers and executive officers of Burlington act as our directors and executive officers.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P39_S2	Certain services are provided to us by other employees of Burlington and we reimburse Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P39_S3	We are not charged, and do not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P39_S4	As of December 31, 2015, we had no employees.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P40_S0	Competition We compete with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, and other entities with objectives similar to ours for the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P40_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of mortgage revenue bonds for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S0	Because we hold mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, a commercial property, and hold an interest in the MF Properties, we may be considered to be in competition with other real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the mortgage revenue bonds owned by us or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily rental properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S2	Multifamily rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S3	To compete effectively, the multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties financed or owned by us must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S4	In order to maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Residential Properties and MF Properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P41_S5	These Residential Properties and MF Properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P42_S0	We believe each of the MF Properties, the Residential Properties, and the commercial property are in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P42_S1	We are not aware of any environmental contamination at any of these properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P43_S0	We are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, there is no provision for income taxes.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P43_S1	The distributive share of our income, deductions and credits is included in each Unitholder s income tax return.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P43_S2	We hold interests in all of the MF Properties except the Suites on Paseo through a subsidiary which is a C corporation for income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P43_S3	This subsidiary files a separate income tax return.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P43_S4	Therefore, we are only subject to income taxes on these investments to the extent we receive dividends from the subsidiary.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P44_S0	We consolidate separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P44_S1	The Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks Consolidated VIEs results of operations were reported as discontinued operations for all periods as presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) reporting purposes and are separate legal entities for all years presented.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P44_S2	The Lake Forest Consolidated VIE results of operations were reported for GAAP reporting purposes as a separate legal entity in 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P45_S0	Form K-1, our ability to distribute income to Unitholders which we believe is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.

1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S1	We do not have any employees of our own.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S2	Employees of Burlington, acting through our general partner, are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S3	In connection with our operation, AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.45% per annum of the principal amount of the revenue bonds, other tax-exempt investments, other investments, and taxable property loans held by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S4	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to us on the mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S5	Our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by us with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S6	In addition, our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that we will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S7	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees in connection with the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S8	In addition, an affiliate of AFCA 2, Farnam Capital Advisors, LLC ( FCA ), acts as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when mortgage revenue bonds and financing facilities are acquired by the Company.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S9	Any fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds out of bond proceeds or by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P49_S10	The amount of fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2, its affiliate, and such property owners.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P50_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P50_S1	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P50_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties financed by additional mortgage revenue bonds acquired by us, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P50_S3	If we acquire ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and, in such case, earn a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P51_S0	Our sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P52_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third party investors.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P52_S1	Because each such outside third party effectively holds a share of the sole limited partner s rights and obligations as a limited partner, BUCs are also referred to herein as shares or units for purposes of calculating amounts per BUC, and the holders thereof are referred to as Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_16_ITEM1_P53_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Cash distributions from us may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Currently cash distributions are made to its Unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by us may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for this purpose.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P0_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we generated Cash Available for Distribution of $0.53 and $0.40 per unit, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P0_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2014, the difference between the $0.50 cash distribution paid and the $0.40 per unit cash available for distribution ( CAD ) reported represented return of capital to Unitholders for the 2014 year.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P1_S0	Although we may supplement our cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless we are able to increase our cash receipts through completion of our current investment plans, we may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P1_S1	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if we complete our current investment plans.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our units.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P2_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying Residential Properties and a commercial prope rty.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Although our mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P2_S2	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying Residential Properties and commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P2_S3	Because of the non-recourse nature of the underlying mortgage loans, the sole source of cash to pay base and contingent interest on the mortgage revenue bond, and to ultimately pay the principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, (except in cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments).
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P2_S4	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other similar multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential properties, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds are located, there is significant competition from other multifamily and single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P5_S3	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The principal of most of our mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S4	Similarly, if a mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P6_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will incur a loss.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P7_S0	In the event a property securing a mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or refinancing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P7_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P7_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold or refinanced.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P8_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The taxable property loans that we make to owners of the Residential Properties that secure mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P8_S2	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P9_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P9_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable property loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, there may be a higher risk of default on the taxable property loans than on the associated mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P10_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P10_S1	While these taxable property loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, we do not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable property loan if the property is not in default on the mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P11_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future bond financings of these projects.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P11_S1	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P11_S2	Our plan is to provide mortgage revenue bond financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S1	For this and other reasons, we may not be able to sell our interest in these MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S2	In addition, the value of our interest in these MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S3	As a result, we may incur a loss upon the sale of our interest in an MF Property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S4	In addition, we may not be able to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S5	During the time we own an interest in an MF Property, any net income we receive from these these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P12_S6	Any future issuances of additional units could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P13_S0	We may issue additional units from time to time in order to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P13_S1	The issuance of additional units could cause dilution of the existing units and a decrease in the market price of the units.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P14_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P14_S1	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P14_S2	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with specific interest rate indices.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P14_S3	All of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P14_S4	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to Unitholders and may affect the market value of our units.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P15_S0	Our use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P15_S1	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the market value of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P15_S2	A decrease in the market value of our mortgage revenue bonds could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P15_S3	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new mortgage revenue bonds that we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P15_S4	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds through the issuance of additional units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing mortgage revenue bonds and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional mortgage revenue bonds, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We use derivative instruments to mitigate some, but not all, of the risks to which we are exposed as a result of changing interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S2	There is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate us from the interest rate risks to which we are exposed.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S3	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and these costs may not ultimately exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S4	There is also a risk that the counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S5	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a derivative position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S6	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P16_S7	This can result in significant period to period volatility in our reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P17_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P17_S1	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P18_S0	The trust or other entity receives all of the interest payments from its underlying mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities from which it pays interest on the senior secur ity at a variable or fixed rate.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P18_S1	As the holder of the residual interest, we are entitled to any remaining interest received by the trust holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the e xpenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents, credit providers, and liquidity providers.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P19_S0	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following: Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P20_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P20_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P20_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less interest available to us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P20_S3	As a result, higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, our return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P20_S4	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and there are no party guarantees to the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P21_S0	We hold a residual interest (known as Class B interests in the TEBS Financing facilities with Freddie Mac and residual participating interests ( LIFER s) in the TOB financing facilities) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P21_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P21_S2	As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to us as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P21_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, we can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P21_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for a number of reasons which could cause us to lose the assets and other collateral we pledged for such financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S1	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for a number of different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S2	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S3	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain credit or liquidity for the trust.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S4	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S5	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then we will be required, through our guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S6	As a result, we, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose our investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S7	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair our ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S8	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S9	In that situation, it is possible that we would not be able to recover the investment assets and other collateral it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by us in such trust or other entity.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P22_S10	Conditions in the credit markets may increase our cost of borrowing or may make financing difficult to obtain, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Economic conditions in international and domestic credit markets have been, and remain, challenging.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P23_S1	Tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth combined with continued concerns about the systemic impact of high unemployment, low wage growth, restricted availability of credit, and overall business and consumer confidence have contributed to a slow economic recovery and it is unclear when and how quickly conditions and markets will improve.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P23_S2	As a result of these economic conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P24_S0	markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, providing funding to borrowers.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P24_S1	As a result, our access t o debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P24_S2	If these market and economic conditions continue, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liqui dity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Federal regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may require us to unwind our tender option bond financing facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S0	On December 10, 2013, U.S. regulators finalized the Volcker Rule adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which limits the ability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain types of covered funds (such as private equity funds and hedge funds) or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading in the U.S.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S1	The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with certain covered funds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S2	As currently structured, TOB Trusts like those used as part of our TOB financing program with DB, fit within the definition of covered funds and will be affected by the Volcker Rule.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S3	The Volcker Rule does not apply to Freddie Mac or more specifically, the M33, M31 and M24 TEBS Financing facilities with Freddie Mac.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S4	The regulators specifically noted that banks will need to evaluate if TOB Trusts are, in fact, covered funds and if so, whether an exception to the definition is available.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S5	The regulators declined to provide a specific exclusion from the definition of covered funds for TOB financing programs.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S6	The preamble also notes that participation in a TOB transaction is not prohibited per se, but is subject to the same restrictions on other covered funds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S7	The effective date for the Volcker Rule was April 1, 2014, however the rule provides for a phase in period during which time banks need to make good faith efforts to have full compliance with the rule by July 21, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S8	The Federal Reserve has extended this conformance period until July 21, 2016, and has announced it intends to grant a further extension until July 21, 2017, provided that the interest in the covered fund was established prior to December 31, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S9	At this time, industry participants are working together to modify the structure of TOBs generally so that they qualify for one of the exceptions contained in the Volcker Rule.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S10	As discussed elsewhere in this document, we had approximately $216.5 million and $174.3 million of outstanding debt financing under our TOB program with DB as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S11	If DB terminates its participation in the TOB program, we would need to find another source of financing to replace the DB TOB financing.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S12	We may not, however, be able to secure such replacement financing and if we can get replacement financing, such financing may be on terms less favorable than those offered by DB.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S13	Any changes to our TOB financing program with DB required by the Volcker Rule could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S14	Any downgrade, or perceived potential of a downgrade, of U.S. sovereign credit ratings or the credit ratings of the U.S. Government-sponsored entities (or GSEs) by the various credit rating agencies may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S15	Our TEBS Financing facilities are an integral part of our business strategy and those financings are dependent upon an investment grade rating of Freddie Mac.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S16	If Freddie Mac were downgraded to below investment grade, it would have a negative effect on our ability to finance our bond portfolio on a longer term basis and could negatively impact Cash Available for Distribution and our ability to continue distributions at current levels.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P26_S17	The federal conservatorship of Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The problems faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commencing in 2008 resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant U.S. Government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S. Government in providing liquidity and credit enhancement for mortgage loans.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P28_S0	In 2011, the Obama administration proposed a plan to wind down the government-sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ), and both houses of Congress are considering legislation to reform the GSEs, their functions and their missions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P28_S1	The future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are likely to be reduced (perhaps significantly) and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P28_S2	Alternatively, it is still possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be dissolved entirely or privatized, and, as mentioned above, the U.S. Government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guarantee obligations could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P29_S1	If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to be eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guarantee obligation), our ability to utilize TEBS Financings facilities could be materially and adversely impacted.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Our mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates are illiquid assets and their va lue may decrease.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S1	As a result, there are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S2	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S3	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S4	As a result, our ability to sell our mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, and the price we may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and a number of other market conditions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S5	As a result, such a sale could result in a loss to us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P31_S6	Delay, reduction, or elimination of appropriations from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can result in payment defaults on our investments in PHC Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S0	We have acquired interests, LIFERS, in three PHC TOB Trusts, which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S2	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S3	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S4	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by us from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S5	A reduction in the rating of PHC Certificates and MBS Securities below investment grade would result in the liquidation of the investment in that TOB Trust Our investment in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities are made pursuant to the provision of our Amended and Restated LP Agreement that allows investment in securities that are not mortgage revenue bonds backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and provide what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S6	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust or any of the MBS Securities was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee of the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P32_S7	Accordingly, we would be required to liquidate our LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P33_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P33_S1	Likewise, if we liquidate the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates or MBS Securities will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P33_S2	As a result, we may not be able to divest our position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P33_S3	Prepayment rates on the mortgage loans underlying our MBS Securities may materially adversely affect our profitability or result in liquidity shortfalls that could require us to sell assets in unfavorable market conditions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our MBS Securities are secured by pools of mortgages on residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P34_S1	In general, the mortgages which collateralize our MBS Securities may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P35_S0	Prepayments on our MBS Securities result when homeowners/mortgagees satisfy (i.e., pay off) the mortgage upon selling or refinancing their mortgaged property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P35_S1	When we acquire a particular MBS, we anticipate that the underlying mortgage loans will prepay at a projected rate which, together with expected coupon income, provides us with an expected yield on such MBS.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P35_S2	If we purchase assets at a premium to par value, and borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected, the corresponding prepayments on the MBS Securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will have to amortize the related premium on an accelerated basis.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P35_S3	Conversely, if we purchase assets at a discount to par value, when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected, the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the MBS Securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Prepayment rates on loans are influenced by changes in mortgage and market interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic, and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P36_S1	Consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P37_S0	In periods of declining interest rates, prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P37_S1	If general interest rates decline at the same time, the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by us in assets yielding less than the yields on the assets that were prepaid (to the extent such assets are available for us to reinvest in).
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P37_S2	In addition, the market value of our MBS Securities may, because of the risk of prepayment, benefit less than other fixed-income securities from declining interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties .
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S1	All of the Residential Properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S3	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S4	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P38_S5	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner s ability to service its debt.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The properties financed by certain of our mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Two of the multifamily housing properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us are located in an area prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P39_S2	The current insurable value of these two properties is approximately $29.7 million.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S0	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property s value.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S1	In general, the current insurance policies on the property financed by us that is located in an area rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a five percent deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S2	As a result, if either of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property, which could result in a default on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S3	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S4	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on our mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P40_S5	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties, in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we acquire ownership of Residential Properties we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may acquire ownership of Residential Properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In either case, during the time we own an MF Property, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates, increases in operating expenses, and the ability to refinance if needed.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and ability to make distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There are a number of risks related to the construction of Residential Properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P45_S0	We may invest in mortgage revenue bonds secured by residential housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P45_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P46_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P46_S1	This may occur for a number of reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P47_S0	some of these risks by obtai ning construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or s uch guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P47_S1	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relat ion to the risks covered.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the mortgage revenue bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our mortgage revenue bond a nd we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable property loan.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S3	An y return on this additional investment would be taxable.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P48_S5	The overall return to us from our investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P49_S0	There are a number of risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We may acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P50_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P50_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P50_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P50_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P51_S1	We have acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P51_S2	When we acquire an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after we acquired our interest in the MF Property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P51_S3	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial and could negatively impact the financial performance of the MF Property.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P52_S0	We are not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P52_S1	We are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because we operate under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P52_S2	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We engage in transactions with related parties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as our General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for some of the Residential Properties that underlie our mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own two of the Residential Properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans held by us are employees of Burlington who are not involved in our operation or management and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S4	These two Residential Properties are Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, which were sold during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S5	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S6	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm s length.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P54_S7	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, or MBS Securities is determined to be taxable.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P56_S0	earned on the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P56_S1	Failure to comply with such requirements may cause interest on the related issue of bonds to be includable in gross income for federal inc ome tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Should the interest income on a mortgage revenue bond be deemed to be taxable, the bond documents include a variety of rights and remedies that we have conc luded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P57_S1	Under such circumstances, we would enforce any and all of such rights and remedies as set forth in the related bond documents as well as any other right s and remedies available under applicable law.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P57_S2	In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any mortgage revenue bond is challenged by the IRS, we would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and wou ld, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P58_S0	The loss of tax-exemption for any particular issue of bonds would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated issue of bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P58_S1	However, the loss o f such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our Unitholders of taxable income relating to such bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Certain of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P59_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and us is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P59_S3	If the IRS were to determine that these mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P59_S4	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities into trusts and are entitled to a share of the interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interest on senior securities and related expenses issued by the trust, it is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Not all of the income received by us is exempt from taxation.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P60_S1	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable property loans to the owners of Residential Properties that collateralize our investments.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P60_S2	The interest income earned by us on these taxable property loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P60_S3	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a mortgage revenue bond or a taxable property loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In that case, the taxable income received by us will be allocated to our Unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is actually distributed to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S0	If we were determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for us and our Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We have determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for us and allow us to pass through our interest which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt to our Unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S3	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is successfully challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S4	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by us to Unitholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of our earnings and profits.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S5	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by us.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P61_S6	The listing of our units for trading on the NASDAQ causes us to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held for the production of interest or dividends, and certain other items.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S2	We expect and believe that substantially all of our gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on our mortgage revenue bonds, but there can be no assurance that will be the case.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S4	In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, we will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P62_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P63_S0	To the extent we generate taxable income; Unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P63_S1	As a partnership, our Unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by us, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P63_S2	There are limits on the ability of our Unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_16_ITEM1A_P63_S3	The ability of Unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by us will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for Unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are collateralized by the Residential Properties and commercial properties.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership does not hold title or any other interest in these properties, other than the mortgages securing the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P1_S0	At December 31, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary held interests in one entity that owns an MF Property, Northern View.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P1_S1	Our wholly-owned subsidiary owns six MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village, Weatherford, The 50/50, and Woodland Park.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P1_S2	In addition, the Partnership owns The Suites on Paseo directly.
1059142_16_ITEM2_P1_S3	The table below reports the details about the MF Properties as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Partnership s BUCs trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATAX.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 2, 2016, the closing price of our BUCs, as reported on the NASDAQ was $4.91.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our BUCs and the distributions paid by us in each of the periods listed.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P1_S0	(1) Represents distributions declared, on a per unit basis, with respect to that quarter Stockholder Information As of December 31, 2015, we had 60,252,928 BUCs outstanding held by a total of approximately 12,000 Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P1_S1	Distributions Future distributions paid by the Partnership will be at the discretion of the Board of Managers and will be based upon financial, capital, and cash flow considerations.
1059142_16_ITEM5_P1_S2	Distributions by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, were as follows (amounts in thousands, except per unit amounts):
1059142_16_ITEM5_P2_S0	The following table provides information with respect to compensation plans under which equity securities of the Partnership are currently authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM5_P3_S0	Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities The Partnership did not sell any of its units in 2015, 2014, or 2013 which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P0_S0	receivables, impairments on assets, deferred gain and rela ted interest, bond discount amortization net of cash received, losses related to Consolidated VIEs, and depreciation and amortization expense on MF Property assets are added back to our net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P1_S0	We use CAD as a supplemental measurement of our ability to pay distributions.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P1_S1	We believe CAD provides relevant information about our operations and is necessary along with net income (loss) for understanding its operating results.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P2_S0	We utilize a calculation of CAD as a means to determine our ability to make distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P2_S1	We believe CAD provides relevant information about our operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding our operating results.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P3_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P4_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P4_S1	Although we consider CAD to be a useful measure of our operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P4_S2	The following sets forth a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and our CAD for the periods set forth.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P5_S0	(1) As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the Unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P5_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P6_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Consolidated VIEs were sold and we realized approximately $4.8 million of contingent interest and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $1.2 million.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P6_S1	In addition, we reported the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial which resulted in an approximately $1.2 million and $3.4 million gain, respectively, and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner was approximately $297,000 and $854,000, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P7_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized the sale of the Autumn Pines bond which resulted in an approximate $873,000 gain and Tier 2 income due to the Partner of approximately $218,000, realized the redemption of the Lost Creek bond which resulted in an approximate $2.8 million gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $709,000, and received contingent interest from Ashley Square generating $10,000 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P8_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P8_S1	We determined that approximately $1.8 million gain from the sale of the Ohio Properties was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P8_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P9_S0	For the year ended 2012, the Tier 2 income is approximately $557,000 recognized on the Arbors at Hickory Ridge mortgage revenue bond re-structuring, $668,000 recognized on the GMF-Madison and GMF-Warren/Tulane mortgage revenue bond sale and $1.4 million recognized on the sale of the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P10_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Tier 2 income is approximately $445,000 recognized on the Briarwood mortgage revenue bond retirement and approximately $308,000 of contingent interest recognized upon the Clarkson mortgage revenue bond retirement.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P11_S0	(2) The developer income amount represents cash received by us for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P11_S1	The 50/50 is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for The 50/50 s development have been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P11_S2	For purposes of CAD, we treat these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P12_S0	(3) We sold the Greens of Pine Glen (the Greens Property ) in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P12_S1	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P12_S2	For this reason, we concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P12_S3	(4) In July 2013, we recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P12_S4	We were required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_16_ITEM6_P13_S0	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by us between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_16_ITEM6_P13_S1	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P8_S0	See Item 7, Results of Operations and Notes 5 and 21 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P9_S0	During 2015, 2014, and 2013, we were invested in other types of securities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P9_S1	In accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, these securities must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency, must generate income which is exempt from inclusion for federal income taxation purposes at the time of acquisition, and may not represent more than 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P10_S0	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P10_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under its Capital Fund Program.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P10_S2	The following table compares total revenues and net income for the PHC Trusts segment for the periods indicated:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P11_S0	The slight decrease in total revenues when comparing 2015 to 2014 was the result of the principal reductions of the PHC Certificates owned by us.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P11_S1	The slight increase in net income when comparing the same periods was related to less interest expense incurred due to the reduction of approximately $610,000 in related PHC TOB Trust financing.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P11_S2	The decrease in revenue and net income when comparing 2014 to 2013 is related to the principal reductions.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P11_S3	See Notes 6 and 21 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P12_S0	The third class of securities owned by us is MBS Securities.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P12_S3	The following table compares total revenues and net income for the MBS Securities segment for the periods indicated:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P13_S0	The decrease in total revenues and net income when comparing 2015 and 2014, resulted from the change in prospective premium amortization of MBS Securities and the sale of approximately $24.6 million par value of the MBS Securities during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P13_S1	The slight decrease when comparing 2014 to 2013 is directly related to the sale of the MBS Securities during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P13_S2	See Notes 7 and 21 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P14_S0	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties, in order to ultimately restructure the property ownership through their sale.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P14_S1	We expect each of these MF Properties will eventually be sold to a not-for-profit entity or in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S0	At December 31, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary held interests in one entity that owns an MF Property containing a total of 270 rental units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S1	Our subsidiary owns six MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village, Weatherford, The 50/50, and Woodland Park containing a total of 1,553 rental units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S2	In addition, we own The Suites on Paseo, 394 rental units, directly.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S3	At December 31, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in three entities that owned MF Properties containing a total of 610 rental units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S4	In addition, our subsidiaries owned six MF Properties, Arboretum, DeCordova, Eagle Village, Weatherford, The 50/50, and Woodland Park containing a total of 1,553 rental units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S5	The MF Properties operating goal is similar to that of the properties underlying our mortgage revenue bond investments.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P15_S6	The following table compares total revenues, total interest expense and net income for the MF Properties segment for the periods indicated:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P16_S0	During 2015 we included The 50/50 MF Property that began leasing in August 2014, and the Suites on Paseo that became an MF Property in September 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P16_S1	We did not include Glynn Place and The Colonial beyond their August and May 2015 sale dates, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P16_S2	The increase in net income for 2015, as compared to 2014 is attributable, for the most part, to a gain of approximately $4.6 million reported on the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial in 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P16_S3	Excluding these 2015 gains the majority of the increase in the loss 2015 as compared to 2014 was attributable to the property operations after the completion of The 50/50 MF Property in August 2014 and the Suites on Paseo was added to the MF Properties in September 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P17_S0	During 2015, The 50/50 MF Property began to accrue real estate taxes and the Suites on Paseo incurred one time acquisition and accrued expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P17_S1	The increase in revenue and a decrease in loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 can be attributed to the completion and lease up of The 50/50 in 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P17_S2	We reported gains of approximately $3.2 million from the recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties and Greens Property for the year ended December 31, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P17_S3	See Notes 8, 10, and 21 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P18_S0	In April 2015, the property owners entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P18_S1	As a result, these entities met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P18_S2	The sales of the Consolidated VIEs were closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P18_S3	The Company reported gains of approximately $3.2 million related to the sale of the Consolidated VIEs as discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P18_S4	No net income or loss from these properties operations or sale accrued to the Unitholders or the General Partner during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P19_S0	As of and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's two Consolidated VIEs are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P19_S1	See Notes 2, 4, 8, 10, 21, and 22 to the Company consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P20_S0	The following table compare s net income from discontinued operations for the periods indicated:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P21_S0	The following tables provide the details related to the TOB Financing securitization, outstanding debt, year acquired, stated maturity, variability, reset frequency, and annual interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P22_S0	(1) Comprised of three TOB Trusts In July 2011, we executed a Master Trust Agreement with DB which allowed us to execute multiple TOB Trust structures upon the approval and agreement of terms by DB.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P22_S1	In July 2015, due to certain restrictions imposed by the Volcker Rule, we restructured eight of the existing TOB Trust structures with DB by entering into a new Master Trust Agreement and related documents to create Term TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P22_S2	See Item 7a, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P23_S0	The following tables provide the details related to the TEBS Financing outstanding debt, year acquired, stated maturity, variability, reset frequency, and annual interest rates at December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P24_S0	In 2015, 2014 and 2010, our consolidated subsidiaries, ATAX TEBS III, LLC, ATAX TEBS II, LLC and ATAX TEBS I, LLC, and we entered into a number of agreements relating to long-term debt financing facilities which are securitization of some of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P24_S1	These are referred to as the M33, M31 and M24 TEBS Financing.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P24_S2	See Item 7a, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S0	The disruptions in domestic and international financial markets and the resulting availability of debt financing have steadily improved since the restrictions seen in 2008.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S1	The decline in construction and rehabilitation of affordable multifamily properties during the previous credit crisis, in our view, continues to create potential investment opportunities for us in both mortgage revenue bonds as well as quality MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S2	Our ability to restructure existing debt, together with the ability to improve the operations of the MF Properties through our affiliated property management company, can position these MF Properties for an eventual financing with mortgage revenue bonds meeting our investment criteria and that will be supported by a valuable and well-run multifamily residential property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S3	We believe we can selectively acquire MF Properties, restructure debt and improve operations in order to create value to our Unitholders in the form of a strong mortgage revenue bond investment.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S4	On the other hand, economic weakness in real estate and municipal bond markets may limit our ability to access additional debt financing that we use to partially finance our investment portfolio or otherwise meet our liquidity requirements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S5	Economic conditions, including sluggish job and income growth and low home mortgage interest rates, have had a negative effect on some of the Residential Properties which collateralize our mortgage revenue bond investments and our MF Properties in the form of lower occupancy.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S6	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the period) will result in lower economic occupancy.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S7	The overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the stabilized Residential Properties that we have financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 90% during 2015 and 91% during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S8	The economic occupancy of the stabilized MF Properties has increased to approximately 90% during 2015 as compared to 87% during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P25_S9	Based on the growth statistics in the market, we expect to see continued improvement in property operations and profitability.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P26_S0	Discussion of the Residential Properties Securing our Mortgage Revenue Bond Holdings and MF Properties as of December 31, 2015 The following tables outline information regarding the Residential Properties on which we hold mortgage revenue bonds as investments.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P27_S0	VIEs that have been sold and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presen ted.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P27_S1	The narrative discussion that follows provides a brief operating analysis of each category for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P28_S0	Non-Consolidated Properties-Stabilized The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P28_S1	As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P28_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, these Residential Properties have met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table).
1059142_16_ITEM7_P28_S3	Debt service on our mortgage revenue bonds for the non-consolidated stabilized properties was current on December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S0	(1) Total revenue is defined as net rental revenue plus other income from the properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S1	(2) Economic occupancy is presented for December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S2	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S3	Actual occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S4	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S5	(3) A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S6	(4) We hold approximately $17.9 million of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the Ohio Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S7	The Ohio Properties are: Crescent Village, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, Willow Bend, located in Columbus (Hilliard), Ohio and Postwoods, located in Reynoldsburg, Ohio.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S8	When comparing the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenue and net operating income of the stabilized non-consolidated properties increased.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S9	The increase is the result of three factors: renovated properties, new investments, and improved performance of existing properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P29_S10	The properties which were renovated in 2014 and are now stabilized contribute approximately 46% of the increase in total revenue and approximately 48% of the increase in net operating income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P30_S0	approximately 37% of the increase in net operating income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P30_S1	Lastly, the existing properties contribute the remaining 13% of the increase in total revenue and 15% of the increase in net operating income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P30_S2	The increase in net operating income is the result of an increase in other income, mainly cable/television commission and a decrease in utility, real estate tax, and insurance expense.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P31_S0	Non-Consolidated Properties-Not Stabilized The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P31_S1	As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P31_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2015, these Residential Properties have not met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table).
1059142_16_ITEM7_P31_S3	On December 31, 2015, debt service on our mortgage revenue bonds for the non-consolidated properties which are not stabilized was current.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S0	(1) Total revenue is defined as net rental revenue plus other income from the properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S1	(2) Economic occupancy is presented for December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S2	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S3	Actual occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S4	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S5	(3) During 2015, these properties were under construction or renovation.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P32_S6	As such, these properties are not considered stabilized as they have not met the criteria for stabilization.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P33_S0	Stabilization is generally defined as 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P33_S1	(4) Previous period occupancy numbers are not available as these are new investments.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P33_S2	(5) The investment in these properties happened in late December, therefore, we have no meaningful revenue, net operating income or economic occupancy to report for the period.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P33_S3	(6) Previous period occupancy numbers are not available as these properties were being renovated in 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P33_S4	When comparing the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenue and net operating income of the non-stabilized non-consolidated properties increased as new collateral was added to our property portfolio with the purchase of approximately $156.5 million of new mortgage revenue bonds.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P36_S1	(2) Economic occupancy is presented for December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P36_S2	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P36_S3	Actual occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P36_S4	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P36_S5	(3) Stabilization is generally defined as 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for all MF Properties that are not student housing residential properties.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P42_S5	The following table compares expenses for the Partnership for the periods presented:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P43_S0	Discussion of the Total Expenses For the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014 Real estate operating expenses .
1059142_16_ITEM7_P43_S1	Real estate operating expenses associated with the MF Properties is comprised principally of real estate taxes, property insurance, utilities, property management fees, repairs and maintenance, and salaries and related employee expenses of on-site employees.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P43_S2	A portion of real estate operating expenses is fixed in nature, thus a decrease in physical and economic occupancy would result in a reduction in operating margins.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P43_S3	Conversely, as physical and economic occupancy increase, the fixed nature of these expenses will increase operating margins as these real estate operating expenses would not increase at the same rate as rental revenues.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P44_S0	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P44_S1	Approximately $2.8 million of the net increase in real estate operating expenses was directly related to four months of operations for the Suites on Paseo, which became an MF Property in September 2015, and The 50/50 MF Property which began lease-up in August 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P44_S2	Offsetting this increase was a decrease of approximately $862,000 related to the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial in 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P44_S3	The remaining changes were mostly related to changes in salaries, real estate taxes, and management fees due to normal property operations.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P45_S0	Depreciation results primarily from the MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S0	Amortization consists of in-place lease intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition-method of accounting for the acquisition of MF Properties and deferred finance cost amortization related to the closing of the TEBS and TOB financing facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S1	Approximately $2.2 million of the net increase in depreciation and amortization was related to The 50/50 MF Property which was placed in service in August 2014 and the addition of the Suites on Paseo in September 2015.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S3	The majority of the remaining increase is related to the additional amortization expense related to our financing facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S4	The net increase in interest expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was the result of an increase of approximately $3.4 million in interest expense related to an approximately $123.6 million increase in average debt outstanding.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S5	Our borrowing cost averaged approximately 2.7% per annum for 2015, as compared to approximately 2.6% per annum for 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S6	The increase in interest rate resulted in approximately $488,000 in additional interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S7	Offsetting these increases was approximately $201,000 due to the change in the mark to market adjustment of our derivatives when comparing the two periods.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S8	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S9	The increase in general and administrative expenses was due to approximately $651,000 increased administrative fees payable to AFCA 2, and approximately $2.0 million in salaries and professional fees which are all attributable to the increased investment portfolio.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P46_S10	In addition, one-time consent solicitation expenses were incurred during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P47_S0	Discussion of the Total Expenses For the Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to December 31, 2013 Real estate operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P47_S1	The overall increase in real estate operating expenses was due to various factors.

1059142_16_ITEM7_P47_S3	Offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately $891,000 related to The 50/50, which began leasing up in August 2014, and Woodland Park, which became an MF Property effective June 1, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P47_S4	See Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P47_S5	The remaining increase was related to the MF Properties normal operating increases in salaries, utilities, management fees, real estate taxes, and repair and maintenance expenses which were related to increased economic occupancy.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P48_S0	Realized loss on taxable property loan.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P48_S1	In June 2013, we redeemed our interest in the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond for approximately $21.9 million.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P48_S2	This redemption resulted in the realization of approximately $4.6 million loss on a taxable property loan as the excess proceeds above the par value of the bond were recognized as contingent interest income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P48_S3	There was no realized loss on taxable property loans reported during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S0	Periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, we evaluate our investments for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S1	During 2014 and 2013, we determined a portion of the taxable property loans were potentially impaired and a provision for loan loss should be recorded.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S2	A provision for loan loss and an associated loan loss reserve of $75,000 and $168,000 was recorded against the Cross Creek taxable property loan during 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S3	A provision for loss was recorded on the interest receivable from the Woodland Park mortgage revenue bond until the foreclosure was completed on May 29, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S4	There was no provision for loss on receivables expense in 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S5	The net increase in depreciation and amortization when comparing 2014 to 2013 was the result of offsetting factors.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S6	There was an approximate $429,000 decrease in in-place lease amortization related to The Colonial and Woodland Park as these were fully amortized in 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S7	This decrease was offset by an approximate $947,000 increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to The 50/50 which began leasing up in August 2014 and depreciation expense related to Woodland Park which became an MF Property effective June 1, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S8	See Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S9	In addition, an approximate $243,000 increase is related to the additional amortization and depreciation expense reported on new deferred debt financing costs and asset additions related to the existing properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S10	The net increase in interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013 was partly due to an approximate $1.7 million increase resulting from the change in the mark to market adjustment of our derivatives.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S11	In addition, an increase of approximately $2.4 million resulted from approximately $93.7 million in greater average debt outstanding between the two periods.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S12	Our borrowing cost averaged approximately 2.6% per annum for 2014 and 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S13	The increase in general and administrative expenses when comparing 2014 to 2013 is attributable to an approximate $755,000 increase in administrative fees payable to AFCA 2 related to the newly acquired mortgage revenue bonds in 2014 offset by an approximate $120,000 reduction due to the Lost Creek mortgage revenue bond redemption and the Autumn Pines mortgage revenue bond sale.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S14	In addition we realized an increase of approximately $715,000 in professional fees and salary and benefits.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P49_S15	The following table compares income from discontinued operations of the Partnership for the periods presented:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P50_S0	The discontinued operations reported in 2015 is comprised of approximately $3.2 million of gain on sales related to Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, Consolidated VIEs, and their related 2015 operating net income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P50_S1	The discontinued operations reported in 2014 was the result of operations related to the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P50_S2	The 2013 income from operations is mostly comprised of approximately $1.8 million gain from the recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties and approximately $1.4 million gain from the recognition of the sale of the Greens Property in 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S0	Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest earned on the mortgage revenue bonds and discontinued operations, and mortgage investment income earned on the PHC Certificates and the MBS Securities represents our principal source of cash flow.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S1	We may also receive interest payments on our property loans, earnings on temporary investments and cash distributions from equity interests held in MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S2	Interest is primarily comprised of fixed rate base interest payments received on our mortgage revenue bonds and MBS Securities which provides fairly constant cash receipts.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S3	Because base interest on each of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities is fixed, our cash receipts tend to be fairly constant period to period unless we acquire or dispose of these or MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S4	Certain of the mortgage revenue bonds may also generate payments of contingent interest to us from time to time when the underlying Residential Properties generate excess net cash flow.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S5	For additional details, see Item 8, Cash Flows from Investing Activities section of the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S6	Similarly, the economic performance of MF Properties will affect the amount of cash distributions, if any, received by us from our ownership of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P51_S7	The economic performance of the Residential Properties depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and on the level of operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (such as zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of an apartment property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S3	For discussion related to economic risk see Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company s report.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S4	Other sources of cash available to us include debt financing, mortgages, and the sale of additional BUCs.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S5	On December 31, 2015, we had outstanding lines of credit of approximately $18.9 million, debt financing of approximately $456.4 million under separate credit facilities and mortgages of approximately $68.3 million secured by six MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S6	We did not issue any additional BUCs during 2015 .
1059142_16_ITEM7_P52_S7	See Notes 11, 12, 13 and 14 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P53_S0	Our principal uses of cash are the, (i) general, administrative and operating expenses (ii) interest and principal on debt and mortgage financing facilities and (iii) payment of distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P53_S1	We also use cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P54_S0	The Consolidated VIEs, which are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein, and MF Properties primary uses of cash were for operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P54_S1	We also used cash for general and administrative expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P54_S2	For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 8, Cash Flows from Operating Activities section of the Company s Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S0	We utilize leverage for the purpose of enhancing investor returns.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S1	We use target constraints for each type of short term financing utilized by us to manage an overall 65% leverage constraint.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S3	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, our overall leverage will not exceed 65%.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S4	On December 31, 2015 our overall leverage constraint, defined as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using the carrying value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS Securities, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost, was approximately 65%.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P55_S5	For additional details related to cash available and used for interest and principal payments, see Item 8, Cash Flows from Financing Activities section of the Company s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P56_S0	On December 31, 2015, our total costs of borrowing by investment type were as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P57_S0	Distributions to the Unitholders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P57_S1	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by us from our portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of our outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by us on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by us, and the number of units outstanding.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P57_S2	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated cash available for distribution of $0.53 per unit.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P57_S3	For further discussion, see Cash Available for Distribution in this section.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P58_S0	We believe our cash balance and cash provided by operations, in combination with other sources of cash, will be sufficient to meet our financing needs over the next 12 months.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P59_S0	We utilize a calculation of CAD as a means to determine our ability to pay distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P59_S1	We believe CAD provides relevant information about our operations and is necessary along with net income for understanding our operating results.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P59_S2	To calculate CAD, we add back non-cash expenses consisting of amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond reissuance costs, interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for loan losses, impairments on bonds, losses related to VIEs including depreciation expense, and income received in cash from transactions which have been eliminated in consolidation, to our net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P59_S3	In addition, we deduct Tier 2 income attributable to the General Partner as defined in the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P60_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P61_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P61_S1	Although we consider CAD to be a useful measure of our operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S0	In 2015, we earned the $0.50 distribution per unit paid to the Unitholders with none of the distribution reported as a return of capital.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S1	Since realized CAD per unit was less than $0.50 per unit in 2014 and 2013, we paid approximately $6.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of the distribution using unrestricted cash to supplement the deficit.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S2	This was a return of capital to Unitholders in these years.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S3	We have historically supplemented our cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash when necessary and will expect to do so in the future if we are unable to earn the declared per unit distribution rate.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S4	Our Amended and Restated LP Agreement permits the General Partner to identify new investment opportunities and continue to identify mortgage revenue bonds it intends to acquire in 2016.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S5	We are actively performing due diligence on the new investment opportunities and mortgage revenue bonds to ensure we continue to meet our investment criteria.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S6	We continue to work with our primary lenders to finance a portion of the acquisition of the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S7	We believe that as we continue to implement our current investment plans, we will be able to continue to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to Unitholders at the existing level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P62_S8	However, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate, which could result in a reduced annual distribution rate per unit.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P63_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to our CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P64_S0	(1) As described in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the Unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P64_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P65_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Consolidated VIEs were sold and we realized approximately $4.8 million of contingent interest and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $1.2 million.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P65_S1	In addition, we reported the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial which resulted in an approximately $1.2 million and $3.4 million gain, respectively, and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner is approximately $297,000 and $854,000, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P66_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized the sale of the Autumn Pines bond which resulted in an approximate $873,000 gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $218,000, realized the redemption of the Lost Creek bond which resulted in an approximate $2.8 million gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $709,000, and received contingent interest from Ashley Square generating $10,000 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P67_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2013, we realized approximately $1.9 million in Tier 2 income from the Iona Lakes mortgage revenue bond redemption.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P67_S1	We determined that approximately $1.8 million gain from the sale of the Ohio Properties was Tier 2 income in 2010, the year in which the Ohio Properties were sold to the unaffiliated not-for-profit.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P67_S2	As such, 25% of that gain was distributed to AFCA 2 in 2010 and there was no Tier 2 income reported in 2013 related to the Ohio Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S0	(2) The developer income amount represents cash received by us for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S1	The development at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S2	For purposes of CAD, we treat these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S3	(3) We sold the Greens Property in conjunction with the purchase of mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S4	The sales price approximated the 2009 property purchase price and therefore the gain from the sale of the property related entirely to depreciation recapture.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S5	For this reason, we concluded that the gain should be excluded from the calculation of CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S6	(4) In July 2013, we recognized the sale of the Greens Property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P68_S7	We were required to follow the deposit method of accounting and had to defer to the gain until sufficient equity was invested by the new unaffiliated owners (which occurred in July 2013).
1059142_16_ITEM7_P69_S0	Mortgage interest income of approximately $135,000 was received by us between October 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported in 2012 CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the first nine months of the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P69_S1	As such, approximately $135,000 of CAD is being reversed out in the 2013 calculation of CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P69_S2	(5) The recognition of the sale of the Ohio Properties allowed us to 1) realize approximately $4.2 million of interest income on the mortgage revenue bonds, 2) recognize approximately $1.1 million of taxable interest income on taxable property loans receivable we held with the Ohio Properties, and 3) realize a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner owner of the Ohio Properties, all in 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P69_S3	See Note 10 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P70_S0	Mortgage interest income of $3.5 million of the $4.2 million had been previously received by us and reported in CAD, and as such, the amount was reversed in the 2013 CAD calculation.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P71_S0	The non-recurring CAD per unit reflects activity that will not recur within a two year period and all periods presented have been adjusted.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P72_S0	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by Residential Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P73_S0	The Residential Properties are owned by entities that are not controlled by us.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P73_S1	We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P74_S0	The Consolidated VIEs did not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P74_S1	For additional discussions related to guarantees, see Note 18 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P75_S0	We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P75_S1	As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P75_S2	We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 15 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P76_S0	Contractual Obligations As discussed in Notes 11, 12 and 13 to the Company s consolidated financial statements; the amounts maturing in 2016 consist of the principal paid on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P76_S1	Our strategic objective is to leverage our bond portfolio utilizing long term securitization financings with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P76_S2	This strategy allows us to better match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to better manage the spread between our assets and liabilities.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P76_S3	We intend and expect to refinance all of our maturing short term debt obligations with the proceeds of at least one additional TEBS financing.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P77_S0	As part of our strategy of acquiring mortgage revenue bonds, we will enter into bond purchase commitments related to mortgage revenue bonds to be issued and secured by properties under construction.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P77_S1	Upon execution of the bond purchase commitment, the proceeds from the mortgage revenue bonds issued will be used to pay off the construction related debt and mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P78_S0	We account for our Bond Purchase Commitments as available-for-sale securities and, as such, record the estimated value of the Bond Purchase Commitments as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P78_S1	See Note 18 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P78_S2	We have the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P79_S0	(1) Interest rates shown are the average effective rate as of December 31, 2015, and include the impact of our interest rate derivatives.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P79_S1	(2) Interest shown is estimated based upon current effective interest rates through maturity.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P80_S0	Inflation With respect to the financial results of our investments in mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the Residential Properties, which collateralize our mortgage revenue bonds, allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable the properties to seek rent increases.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P80_S1	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P80_S2	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P81_S0	Inflation did not have a significant impact on our financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P82_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P82_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by us.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P82_S2	All of our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P82_S3	We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies because they involve our judgments, assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P82_S4	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P83_S0	Accounting for the TEBS and TOB Financing Arrangements We have evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS and TOB financing arrangements and have determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P83_S1	See Note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P84_S0	VIEs We invest in mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing of Residential Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P84_S1	We generally own 100% of these bonds and each bond is secured by a first mortgage on the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P84_S2	We have also made taxable property loans to the property owners in certain cases which are secured by second mortgages on these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P85_S0	Although each multifamily and student housing property financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by us is owned by a separate entity in which we have no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by us creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require us to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P85_S1	See Note 2 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Property Loans Valuation - As all of our investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S1	We generally own 100% of each of these bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S3	As a result, we base our estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by us.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S4	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in our application.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S5	If available, we may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S6	Pricing services, broker quotes and our internal analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P86_S7	See Note 2 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P87_S0	Review of securities for other-than-temporary impairment - We periodically review each of our mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P87_S1	We evaluate whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_16_ITEM7_P88_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P89_S0	While we evaluate all av ailable information, we focus specifically on whether we intend to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that we will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whethe r we expect to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P89_S1	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P90_S0	In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by us, loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P90_S1	All of these loans are made on a non-recourse basis.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P90_S2	As a result, the repayment of these loans depends on the cash flows generated by the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P90_S3	We periodically evaluate these loans for potential losses by utilizing the practical expedient method allowed for in the guidance for measuring impairment on a collateral dependent loan.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P90_S4	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P91_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates Valuation - As all of our investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P91_S1	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what we would actually receive for the sale of the PHC certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P91_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P91_S3	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P92_S0	Investment in Mortgage-Backed Securities Valuation - We value each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P92_S1	The valuation methodology of our third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P92_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P93_S0	We analyze pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which we estimate as 7.5%.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P93_S1	We also look at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P93_S2	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P94_S0	Revenue recognition - mortgage revenue bonds, investments in real estate, MBS Securities and PHC Certificates - Interest on our mortgage revenue bonds, MBS Securities and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P94_S1	Rental revenue from MF Properties and Consolidated VIEs is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P94_S2	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P95_S0	Our investments in interest rate derivative agreements are accounted for under the guidance that establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging activity.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P96_S0	The fair values of the interest rate derivatives at inception are their original cost.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P96_S1	Changes in the fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements are recognized in earnings as interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P96_S2	See Note 16 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_16_ITEM7_P96_S3	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S0	The fair value of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities are also directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S1	An increase in rates will cause the fair value of these investments to decrease.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S2	Although changes in the fair value of the assets do not impact earnings or cash flow, they affect total partners capital and book value per unit.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S3	In addition, if the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities decreases, we may need to provide additional collateral for our debt financing secured by these assets.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S4	We base the fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by us.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S5	This calculation methodology encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P0_S6	If available we may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P1_S0	As of December 31, 2015, all of our mortgage revenue bonds were valued using management s discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P1_S1	The PHC Certificates were valued using management s yield to maturity analyses and the MBS Securities were priced using third-party pricing services.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P1_S2	Pricing services, broker quotes, and management s analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P1_S3	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what we would actually receive in a sale of these investments.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P1_S4	If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the markets deteriorate further, or we experience deterioration in the values of our investment portfolio, we may incur impairments to our investment portfolio which could negatively impact our financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Interest Rate Risk Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The nature of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS Securities, and the debt financing used to finance these investments exposes us to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, and MBS Securities all bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In addition, the mortgage revenue bonds may also pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average base rate of the mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.3% per annum, the weighted average base rate of the PHC Certificates was approximately 5.2% per annum and the weighted average coupon rate of the MBS Securities was approximately 4.3% per annum.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P3_S3	The following is a summary of the Partnership s TEBS Financing at December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If the average SIFMA Index Rate, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015, the interest expense payments on this variable-rate debt financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $2.4 million.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P5_S0	The following is a summ ary of the Partnership s TOB Trust Financing at December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P6_S0	If the average rates, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015, the interest expense payments on the TOB Trust financing would have increased or decreased by approximately $2.2 million.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P6_S1	The following is a summary of the Partnership s MF Property Mortgage Payables at December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P7_S0	If the average rates, including fees, had increased or decreased by 100 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2015, the interest expense payments on the mortgage payables would have increased or decreased by approximately $683,000.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P8_S0	We manage our interest rate risk on our debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate financing facilities.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The following table sets forth c ertain information regarding the Partnership s interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2015:
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P9_S0	In addition to the interest rate cap agreements, we contracted for two interest rate swaps with DB related to the Decatur Angle and Bruton TOB financing facilities collateralized by mortgage revenue bonds that are used to provide financing for the construction of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The swap related to the Decatur Angle TOB financing facility has a $23.0 million notional value, an October 15, 2016 effective date, and an October 15, 2021 termination date.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The swap related to the Bruton TOB financing facility has an approximate $18.1 million notional value, an April 15, 2017 effective date, and an April 15, 2022 termination date.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P9_S3	Both swaps are in place to mitigate the possible interest rate increases and swaps a variable rate based on LIBOR for an approximate 2.0% fixed rate.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P9_S4	On December 31, 2015 the fair value of the Decatur Angle swap is a liability of approximately $737,000 and the fair value of the Bruton swap is a liability of approximately $580,000.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P10_S0	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P10_S1	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $1.8 and $2.0 million in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P11_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P11_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $344,000 and $268,000 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P12_S0	Our primary credit risk is the risk of default on our investment in mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans collateralized by the Residential Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P12_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities, any insurer or other party.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P13_S0	associated taxable property loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P13_S1	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable property l oans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from any sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P14_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P15_S0	A property s ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of its operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential properties in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S1	This is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (e.g. zoning laws); inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S3	We also have credit risk in its investment in PHC Certificates, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S4	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S5	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S6	Defaults on the mortgage revenue bonds, taxable property loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to Unitholders.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S7	In addition, if a property s net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P16_S8	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan secured by the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P17_S0	In the event of a default on a mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan, we will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P17_S1	If we take ownership of the property securing a defaulted mortgage revenue bond, we will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P17_S2	If such an event occurs, such amounts may not provide tax-exempt income.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P18_S0	We actively manage the credit risks associated with our mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans by performing a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these investments prior to investing.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P18_S1	In addition, we carefully monitor the performance of the properties underlying these investments subsequent to their purchase by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P19_S0	Our primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the rating report issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P19_S1	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2015, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_16_ITEM7A_P19_S2	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our risk mitigating strategies at that time and the overall business and economic environment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Directors and Partners of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. Omaha, Nebraska We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P0_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P0_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P0_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P0_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S4	As discussed in Notes 5, 6 , 9 and 17, the consolidated financial statements include total investments valued at approximately $655,000,000 (75% of total assets) and $521,000,000 (70% of total assets) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S5	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, management s estimates were based on discounted cash flows or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P1_S6	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P7_S0	Organization America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P7_S1	America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. expects and believes the interest earned on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P7_S2	As a result, most of the income earned by the America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P8_S0	The general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P9_S0	The affairs of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and the conduct of its business are governed by the America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015 (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P10_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation The Partnership, as used herein, includes America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P11_S0	The wholly-owned subsidiaries include the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the wholly-owned subsidiaries (a Holding Company ) holds a 99% limited partner interest.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P11_S1	The wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Partnership consist of:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P12_S0	ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the TEBS Financing, M24 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 12).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P13_S0	ATAX TEBS II, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created in 2014 to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the second TEBS financing, M31 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 12).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P14_S0	ATAX TEBS III, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created in 2015 to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the third TEBS Financing, M33 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 12).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P15_S0	ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership committed to loan money for the development of multifamily properties (see Note 9).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P16_S0	Eight MF Properties which are either wholly or majority owned by the Partnership or subsidiaries of the Partnership (see Note 8).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P17_S0	Two properties, Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, in which the Partnership does not hold an ownership interest but which own multifamily properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership are VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P17_S1	The Partnership has been determined to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P17_S2	The Consolidated VIEs are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and all significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P18_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P19_S0	Variable Interest Entities Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of the entities which own the Residential Properties and commercial property financed with mortgage revenue bonds it holds to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P20_S0	Generally, a VIE is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P21_S0	The guidance requires the Partnership to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests gi ve it a controlling financial interest in a VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P21_S1	This analysis identifies the primary beneficiary, the entity that must consolidate the VIE, as the entity that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P21_S2	The Partnership re-evaluated al l of its investments to determine if the property owners are VIEs and, if so, whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P21_S3	The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P21_S4	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P22_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P22_S1	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P22_S2	The Partnership does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under GAAP impacts the Partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership, the treatment of the mortgage revenue bonds on the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs as debt, the nature of the interest payments, which it believes to be tax-exempt, received on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Form K-1.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P23_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs since the applicable consolidation date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P23_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P24_S0	The primary purpose of the Partnership is to acquire, hold, sell and otherwise deal with mortgage revenue bonds and other instruments which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for Residential Properties and other commercial properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P24_S1	The Mortgage Revenue Bonds, the PHC Certificates, and the MBS Securities segments fulfill this purpose, are long-term investments, and the properties which collateralize the mortgage revenue bonds are not owned or managed by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S0	The MF Property segment is comprised of directly and indirectly owned, actively managed, and controlled multifamily properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S1	The MF Properties included in this segment are typically financed with third party mortgages.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S2	Effective in 2015, the Company changed its reportable segments due to the classification of the Company s Consolidated VIEs as discontinued operations.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S3	The Consolidated VIE segment was comprised of the results of operations of the underlying collateral for the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S4	The Company concluded its investment in the Consolidated VIE segment was not consistent with the Company s portfolio of assets, as described above.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S5	As such, the Company decided to implement a strategic shift in direction by discontinuing its Consolidated VIE segment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P25_S6	This decision was made for the following reasons:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P26_S0	The risk profile of the Consolidated VIE segment was unique as the substance of the investment was the result of the operations of the underlying properties and not the mortgage revenue bonds (which is the form of the investment).The risk profile includes:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P27_S0	The lack of ultimate decision-making authority.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P28_S0	The stated purpose of the Company was not to manage properties without having some type of ownership or ability to control the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P29_S0	Subsequent to the disposition of the Consolidated VIE properties by their owners, the Company does not plan to include this type of investment as part of its strategic direction.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S0	In April 2015, the Partnership entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S1	As a result, these entities met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S2	The sales of the Consolidated VIEs were closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S3	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s Consolidated VIEs are reported as discontinued operations on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S4	As of and for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company's two Consolidated VIEs are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P30_S5	No net income or loss from these properties operations or sale accrued to the Unitholders or the General Partner during 2015 (see Notes 4, 8, 10, 21, and 22).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P31_S0	Acquisition Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on acquisition accounting, the Partnership allocates the contractual purchase price of a property acquired to the land, building, and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P31_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P32_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P32_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P33_S0	The acquisition related costs to acquire a property are expensed as incurred.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Partnership maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S2	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are equal to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S3	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S4	The Partnership is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S5	The Partnership does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P34_S6	This risk is minimized significantly by the Partnership s portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P35_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash is legally restricted to use and is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, restricted compensating balances, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P35_S1	At December 31, 2015, certain of our credit facilities require restricted cash balances as additional collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P35_S2	Specifically, approximately $5.4 million related to the TEBS Financing facilities, approximately $400,000, related to the M24 Financing facility derivatives, and approximately $1.5 million related to the interest rate swaps were held in restricted cash (see Note 16).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Partnership accounts for its investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other investments under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P36_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P36_S2	All of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and other investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P36_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P37_S0	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P37_S1	As a result, the Partnership bases its estimate of fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P37_S2	This calculation methodology encompasses a significant amount of management judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P37_S3	If available, the Partnership may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services or broker quotes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P37_S4	Pricing services, broker quotes and the Partnership s analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P38_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P38_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P39_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P40_S0	While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether it has the intent to sell the securities prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, whether it is likely that the Partnership will be required to sell the securities before a recovery in value and whether the Partnership expects to recover the securities entire amortized cos t basis.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P40_S1	The ability to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis is based on the likelihood of the issuer being able to make required principal and interest payments on the security.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P41_S0	The primary source of repayment of the amortized cost is the cash flows produced by the property which serve as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P41_S1	The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property that serves as collateral on the bond and compares the results of the model to the amortize d cost basis of the bond.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P41_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bond s in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P41_S3	The inputs to these models require the Partnership to make assumptions, the most significant of which include:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P42_S0	Revenue and expense projections for the property operations, which result in the estimated net operating income generated over the ten year holding period assumed in the model.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P43_S0	Base year (model year one) assumptions are based on historical financial results and operating budget information.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P44_S0	The capitalization rate utilized to estimate the sales proceeds from an assumed property sale in year ten of the model.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P44_S1	The capitalization rate used in the current year models ranged between 5.3% and 7.5% which the Partnership believes represents a reasonable range given the current market for Residential Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P45_S0	The revenue, expense and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P46_S0	Operating results from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depend on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P46_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of and demand for multifamily residential properties in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P46_S2	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P47_S0	Net operating income from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P47_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S0	If the discounted cash flows from a property are less than the amortized cost of the bond, the Partnership believes that there is a strong indication that the cash flows from the property will not support the payment of the required principal and interest on the bond and, accordingly, the bond is considered other-than-temporarily impaired.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S1	If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the amortized cost basis of the mortgage revenue bond is written down to its estimated fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S2	The amount of the write-down representing a credit loss is accounted for as a realized loss on the statement of operations.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S3	The amount of the write-down representing a non-credit loss is recorded to other comprehensive income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S4	The difference between the amortized cost basis and the discounted cash flows using the effective interest rate represents the credit loss.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P48_S5	Any residual decline in value would be considered the interest related loss or non-credit loss.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P49_S0	The recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P50_S0	If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Partnership owns some mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P51_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method and the result is realized in investment income in the current period.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Partnership eliminates the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P53_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities The Partnership accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P53_S1	The guidance requires investments in securities to be classified as one of the following: 1) held-to-maturity, 2) available-for-sale, or 3) trading securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P53_S2	All of the Partnership s PHC Certificates and MBS Securities investments are classified as available-for-sale, and are reported at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P53_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P54_S0	There is no active trading market for the PHC Certificates and price quotes are not available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P55_S0	The estimates of the fair values of the PHC Certificates are based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the PHC Certificates adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P55_S1	The Partnershi p s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to the Partnership s estimates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P56_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P56_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P57_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P58_S0	The Partnership values each MBS security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P58_S1	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P58_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P59_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Partnership estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P59_S1	The Partnership also looks at observations of trading activity in the market place when available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P59_S2	The Partnership periodically reviews each MBS Security for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P59_S3	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a security below its amortized cost is other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including the duration and severity of the decline in fair value and the Partnership s intent and ability to hold the security until its value recovers.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P60_S0	Each MBS Security has been rated either AAA or AA by either S P or Moody s.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P60_S1	A downgrade in rating for each MBS Security or new issuances of similar MBS Securities with ratings by S P or Moody s below the A rating would be a factor in concluding that impairment is other-than-temporary.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S0	Investments in Real Estate The Partnership s investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19-40 years on multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements and is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S2	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S3	The Partnership also holds land held for investment and development which is reported at cost.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S4	The Partnership reviews each property and land held for investment and development for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P61_S5	The review of recoverability is based upon comparing the net book value of each real estate property to the sum of its estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P62_S0	If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P63_S0	Taxable Property Loans In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, taxable property loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P63_S1	The repayment of these taxable property loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralize the loans.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P63_S2	The Partnership periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralizes the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any taxable property loans.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P64_S0	The Partnership utilizes the discounted cash flow model ( DCF ) discussed above except that in estimating a property fair value, the Partnership evaluates a number of different DCF models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P64_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P64_S2	The Partnership may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P65_S0	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allo wance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P65_S1	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P66_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P66_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015 2014 and 2013, the Partnership recognized a provision for loan losses of approximately $0, $75,000 and $168,000, respectively (see Note 9).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P66_S2	The Partnership has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS and TOB Financing arrangements (Note 12) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P66_S3	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P66_S4	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P67_S0	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P68_S0	The M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Partnership to (1) cause the return of certain individual bonds under defined circumstances, (2) cause the return of all of the bonds by electing an Optional Series Pool Release or (3) cause the return of any defaulted bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P68_S1	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2010 as two specific dates, September 15, 2017, or September 15, 2020, on which the Partnership has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P68_S2	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2014 as two specific dates, July 15, 2019 or July 15, 2024, on which the Partnership has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P68_S3	The Optional Series Pool Release is defined in the agreements closed in 2015 as two specific dates, July 15, 2020 or July 15, 2025, on which the Partnership has the option to repurchase all of the securitized bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P68_S4	Given these terms, the Partnership has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present in the agreements and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P69_S0	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P69_S1	The TOB Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Partnership to call the bonds held in the TOB Trusts through their ownership of the LIFERS so effective control has not been transferred.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S0	In addition to evaluating the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Financings as a sale or transfer of financial assets, we have evaluated the securitization trusts associated with the TEBS Financing facilities, the M33 TEBS Trust, M31 TEBS Trust, and M24 TEBS Trust, under the provisions of consolidation guidance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S1	As part of the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Financings, certain bond assets of the Partnership were securitized into the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts with Freddie Mac.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S2	The M33, M31 and M24 TEBS Trusts then issued Class A and B TEBS Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S3	Other Partnership investments are securitized into TOB Trusts with DB.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S4	The TOB trustee then issued senior floating-rate participation interests ( SPEARS ) and LIFERS.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S5	The Partnership has determined that the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts are VIEs and the Class B Certificates owned by the Partnership create a variable interest in the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S6	It was also determined that the TOB Trusts are VIEs and the LIFERS owned by the Partnership create a variable interest entity in the TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P70_S7	In determining the primary beneficiary of the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts and TOB Trusts, the Partnership considered the activities of each of the VIEs which most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entity was designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P71_S0	The Partnership has retained the right, pursuant to the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Financing agreements, to either substitute or reacquire some or all of the securitized bonds at various future dates and under various circumstances.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P71_S1	As a result, the Partnership determined it had retained a controlling financial interest in the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts because such actions effectively provide the Partnership with the ability to control decisions pertaining to the VIE s management of interest rate and credit risk.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P71_S2	While in the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS Trusts, the bond assets may only be used to settle obligations of the trusts and the liabilities of the trusts do not provide the Class A certificate holders with recourse to the general credit of the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P71_S3	The Partnership also determined it was the primary beneficiary of the TOB Trusts as it has the right to cause each TOB trust to sell the securitized asset in each specific TOB Trust.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P71_S4	If the securitized assets were sold, the extent to which the VIE will be exposed to gains or losses from changes in the fair market value of the securitized assets would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P72_S0	It was determined that the Partnership met the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIE and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary under these financing arrangements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P72_S1	Given these accounting determinations, the M33, M31, and M24 TEBS and TOBS Financing fa cilities and the associated M33, M31, and M24 TEBS and TOBS Financings are presented as secured financing to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P73_S0	The bond purchase commitments held by the Partnership have no cost.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P73_S1	The commitments are required to be measured and recorded at fair value, which is estimated under the same methodology as the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds in the Company s consolidated financial statements (see Notes 5, 17, and 18).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P74_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P74_S1	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P74_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, debt financing costs and bond issuance costs of $10.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively, were included in other assets.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P74_S3	These costs are reduced on the balance sheet by the accumulated amortization of approximately $4.9 million and $3.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are reflected with depreciation on the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P75_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes because the Unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership s taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P75_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership are corporations that are subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P75_S2	At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership evaluated whether it was more likely than not that any deferred tax assets would be realized.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P75_S3	The Partnership recorded a full valuation allowance of approximately $405,000 and $8.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively against the deferred tax assets created at these entities by timing differences because the realization of these future benefits is not more likely than not.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S1	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S2	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S3	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized as it is received.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond s ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S5	Contingent interest income, which is only received by the Partnership if the property financed by a mortgage revenue bond that contains a contingent interest provision generates excess available cash flow as set forth in each bond, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S6	Past due contingent interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P76_S7	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P77_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates The Partnership s Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties (see Note 8) are lessors of multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P77_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P77_S2	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned (see Notes 6 and 7).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P78_S0	The Partnership accounts for its derivative and hedging activities in accordance with the guidance on Derivatives and Hedging.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P79_S0	The guidance on Derivatives and Hedging requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets and measurement of these instruments at fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P80_S0	The accounting treatment is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and, if so, the type of hedge.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P80_S1	The Partnership s interest rate derivative agreements do not have a specific hedge designation under the guidance on derivatives and hedging, and therefore changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P81_S0	The Partnership is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P81_S1	The Partnership does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P82_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivative agreements is determined based upon current price quotes by recognized dealers.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P83_S0	Ne t Income per BUC Net income per BUC has been calculated based on the weighted average number of BUCs outstanding during each year presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Partnership has no dilutive equity securities and, therefore, basic net income per BUC is the same as diluted net income per BUC.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P83_S2	The BUCs earnings are comprised of 99% of all net recurring income from the Partnership and 75% of Tier 2 income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P83_S3	The net income per BUCs includes no amounts related to the results of operations or the sales of the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P84_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P84_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P84_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuation, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S0	The Amended and Restated LP Agreement contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale or liquidation of investments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each Unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each Unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each Unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each Unitholder as of such date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S3	For purposes of the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, cash distributions, if any, received by the Partnership from the Investment in MF Properties (see Note 8) will be included in the Partnership s Interest Income and cash distributions received by the Partnership from the sale of such properties will be included in the Partnership Residual Proceeds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S4	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis but may be made on a monthly or semiannual basis at the election of AFCA 2.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P85_S5	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income is distributed 99% to the Unitholders and 1% to AFCA 2 and Net Residual Proceeds are distributed 100% to Unitholders except that Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest in an amount equal to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the mortgage revenue bonds on a cumulative basis (defined as Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2), respectively) are distributed 75% to the Unitholders and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P86_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is primarily comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P86_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Consolidated VIEs were sold during 2015, therefore the unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs is zero on December 31, 2015 (see Note 2, Principles of Consolidation ).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P86_S3	The distributions paid or accrued per BUC during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P87_S0	Although Residential Properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership are owned by separate entities in which the Partnership has no equity ownership interest, the debt financing provided by the Partnership creates a variable interest in these ownership entities that may require the Partnership to report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these entities on a consolidated basis under GAAP.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P87_S1	Under consolidation guidance, the Partnership must make an evaluation of these entities to determine if they meet the definition of a VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P88_S0	In April 2015, the Partnership entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P88_S1	As a result, these entities met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P88_S2	For additional details, see Note 2, Principles of Consolidation .
1059142_16_ITEM8_P89_S0	The Partnership does not hold an equity interest in these VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P89_S1	Therefore, the assets of the VIEs cannot be used to settle the general commitments of the Partnership and the Partnership is not responsible for the commitments and liabilities of the VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P89_S2	The p rimary risks to the Partnership associated with these VIEs include the entities ability to meet debt service obligations to the Partnership and the valuation of the underlying Residential Properties which serves as bond collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P89_S3	The following is a discussion of the significant judgments and assumptions made by the Partnership in determining the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, whether the Partnership must consolidate the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P90_S0	Consolidated VIEs In determining the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, the Partnership considers the activities of the VIE which most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, who has the power to control such activities, the risks which the entities were designed to create, the variability associated with those risks and the interests which absorb such variability.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P90_S1	The Partnership also considers the related party relationship of the entities involved in the VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P90_S2	It was determined that the Partnership, as part of the related party group, met both of the primary beneficiary criteria and was the most closely associated with the VIEs and, therefore, was determined to be the primary beneficiary.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P91_S0	The capital structure of Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs consisted of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P91_S1	The senior debt was in the form of a mortgage revenue bond and accounts for the majority of the total capital of each VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P91_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership was entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the bond documents.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by three individuals, one of which is a related party.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S1	Additionally, each of these properties is managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, Properties Management, which is an affiliate of Burlington.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S2	The Partnership determined it was the primary beneficiary of the Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks VIEs, the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S3	The sales of the Consolidated VIEs were closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S4	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s Consolidated VIEs are reported as discontinued operations on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S5	As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company's two Consolidated VIEs are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S6	The Company has also eliminated the Consolidated VIE segment as a reportable segment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S7	No net income or loss from these properties operations or sale accrued to the Unitholders or the General Partner during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P92_S8	For additional details, see Notes 2, 8, 10, 21, and 22 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P93_S1	While the capital structures of these VIEs resulted in the Partnership holding a majority of the variable interests in these VIEs, the Partnership determined it does not have the power to direct the activities of these VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and, as a result, is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P94_S0	The following tables present information regarding the Non-Consolidated VIEs held by the Partnership as o f December 31, 2015 and 2014:

1059142_16_ITEM8_P95_S2	The Consolidated VIEs were sold in the fourth quarter of 2015, therefore there were no assets held for sale reported as of December 31, 2015.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P97_S0	them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P97_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the p roperties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P97_S2	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the mortgage revenue bonds is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P97_S3	Each mortgage revenue bond, however, is collateralized by a mortgage on all re al and personal property included in the related property and bears interest at a fixed rate and two of the mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable from available net cash flow generated by the finan ced property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P97_S4	The following tables present information regarding the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P98_S0	Valuation - As all of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds are classified as available-for-sale securities, they are carried on the balance sheets at their estimated fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P98_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average base rate of the mortgage revenue bonds reported in the consolidated financial statements was approximately 6.3% per annum.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P98_S2	Due to the limited market for the mortgage revenue bonds, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P98_S3	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not generally available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P98_S4	As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, all of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds were valued using discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis performed by management.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P99_S0	The Partnership s valuation encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S0	The key assumption in the Partnership s yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields on the individual bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S1	At December 31, 2015, the range of effective yields on the individual bonds was 4.2% to 12.1% per annum.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S2	Additionally, the Partnership calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S3	Assuming an immediate ten percent adverse change in the key assumption, the effective yields on the individual bonds would increase to a range of 4.6% to 13.3% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $35.7 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S4	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S5	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S6	If available, the Partnership may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S7	Pricing services, broker quotes and the Partnership s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S8	Unrealized gains or losses on these mortgage revenue bonds are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the underlying properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S9	The Partnership has reviewed each of its mortgage revenue bonds for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P100_S10	Based upon this evaluation, the current unrealized losses on these six bonds are not considered to be other-than-temporary.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P101_S0	If yields on new issuance of investments increase, the Partnership experiences deterioration in the estimated fair values of its investment portfolio, or if the Partnership s intent and ability to hold certain bonds changes, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Company s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P102_S0	The Partnership has the intent and ability to hold these mortgage revenue bonds until their stated maturity.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P102_S1	The Partnership s ability to recover the mortgage revenue bonds entire amortized cost basis is dependent upon the issuer being able to meet debt service requirements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P103_S0	The primary source of repayment is the cash flows produced by the property which serves as the collateral for the bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P103_S1	The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model for the underlying property and compares the results of the model to the amortized cost basis of the bond.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P103_S2	These models reflect the cash flows expected to be generated by the underlying properties over a ten year period, including an assumed property sale at the end of year ten, discounted using the effective interest rate on the bonds in accordance with the accounting guidance on other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P103_S3	The revenue, expense, and resulting net operating income projections which are the basis for the discounted cash flow model are based on judgment.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P124_S1	This $18.5 million par value mortgage revenue bond had been acquired for approximately $15.9 million in May 2010.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P124_S2	The Partnership received approximately $18.7 million for the Lost Creek mortg age revenue bond resulting in an approximate $2.8 million realized gain.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P124_S3	This gain was Tier 2 income with approximately $2.1 million allocated to the Unitholders and approximately $709,000 allocated to the General Partner.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P125_S0	The properties securing the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are geographically dispersed throughout the United States with significant concentrations in California and Texas.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P125_S1	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the concentration in California, as a percentage of principal outstanding, was approximately 8% and 18%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P125_S2	As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the concentration in Texas, as a percentage of principal outstanding, was approximately 51% and 38%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P125_S3	The Live 929 property in Baltimore, Maryland represents approximately 8% and 10% of the outstanding principal of the mortgage revenue bonds as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P126_S0	The following tables represent a description of certain terms of the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P127_S0	6. PHC Certificates In July 2012, the Partnership purchased 100% of the LIFERs in the PHC TOB Trusts which acquired approximately $65.3 million of PHC Certificates issued by three trusts ( PHC Trusts ) sponsored by DB.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P127_S1	The assets held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P127_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P128_S0	Under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P128_S1	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P128_S2	The loans payable by the public housing authorities are not debts, nor guaranteed by the United States of America or HUD.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P128_S3	Interest payable on the public housing authority debt held by the PHC Trusts is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P128_S4	The PHC Certificates issued by each of the PHC Trusts have been rated investment grade by Standard Poor s.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P129_S0	The Partnership purchased the LIFERS issued by the PHC TOB Trusts for approximately $16.0 million and pledged the LIFERS to the trustee to secure certain reimbursement obligations of the Partnership as the holder of LIFERS.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P129_S1	The PHC TOB Trusts also issued SPEARS of approximately $49.0 million to unaffiliated investors.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P129_S2	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the PHC TOB Trusts and have been credit enhanced by DB.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P129_S3	The LIFERS entitle the Partnership to all principal and interest payments received by the PHC TOB Trusts on the $65.3 million of PHC Certificates held by it after preferred return payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P130_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) rates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P130_S1	The Partnership determined that the three PHC TOB trusts are variable interest entities and that the Partnership was the primary beneficiary of each of the three PHC TOB trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P130_S2	As a result, the Partnership reports the PHC TOB Trusts on a consolidated basis and the SPEARS as debt financing.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P131_S0	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Partnership considered who has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P132_S0	The indenture for the PHC TOB trusts stipulates that the Company has the sole right to cause the PHC TOB trusts to sell the PHC Certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P132_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses associated with variability in the PHC Certificates fair value arising from changes in municipal bond market rates therefore would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P133_S0	The Partnership had the following investments in the PHC Certificates on December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S0	Valuation - As all of the Partnership s investments in PHC Certificates are classified as available-for-sale securities and are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S1	As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average base rate of the PHC Trust Certificates was approximately 5.2% per annum.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S2	Due to the limited market for the PHC Certificates, these estimates of fair value do not necessarily represent what the Partnership would actually receive in a sale of the certificates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S3	The estimates of the fair values of these PHC Certificates is based on a yield to maturity analysis which begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the PHC Certificates adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants which includes adjustments for the fact that the PHC Certificates investment grade rating is below AAA .
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S4	The Partnership s valuation encompasses judgment in its application and pricing as determined by pricing services, when available, is compared to the Partnership s estimates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P134_S5	The PHC Certificates are AA- , A+ , and BBB rated and the range of effective yields was 3.9% to 5.7% per annum at December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S0	calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of these PHC Certifi cates which is the yield for a new issuance of a similarly structure security.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S1	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the individual PHC Certificates would increase to a range of 4.3% to 6.2% per annum and would resul t in additional unrealized losses on the PHC Certificates of approximately $2.0 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S2	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S3	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fai r value and should be used with caution.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S4	If available, the Partnership may also consider other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S5	The most recent update on the annual appropriations from HUD disclosed no significant changes in the program which means the underlying performance of the PHC Certificates will be in line with expectations until the next annual update.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S6	Further, there have been no downgrades in the investment grade rating of any of the three PHC Certificates noted since t he investment was originally acquired in July 2012.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P135_S7	The following table sets forth certain information relating to the PHC Certificates held in the PHC TOB Trusts:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P136_S0	MBS Securities Between November 2012 and April 2013, the Partnership executed six securitizations of MBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P136_S1	The Partnership purchased the LIFERS issued by the six MBS TOB Trusts for approximately $9.2 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P136_S2	Each of the six MBS TOB Trusts issued SPEARS to unaffiliated investors; these SPEARS totaled approximately $34.9 million at issuance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P136_S3	The SPEARS represent senior interests in the MBS TOB Trusts, have been credit enhanced by DB and are recorded as debt financing in the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P136_S4	The LIFERS entitle the Partnership to all principal and interest payments received by the MBS TOB Trust on the securitized MBS Securities after payments due to the holders of the SPEARS and trust costs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P137_S0	The SPEARS bear interest at a variable rate based on Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) rates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P137_S1	See Note 12 for further discussion related to the securitization of the MBS Securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S0	In May 2014, the Partnership sold a portion of the MBS TOB Trusts for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S1	This approximately $3.7 million par value MBS Securities had been acquired for approximately $3.8 million in November 2012 (see Note 12).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S2	In October 2014, the Partnership sold a portion of the MBS Securities for an amount approximating the outstanding amortized cost.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S3	The approximate $24.4 million par value of the MBS Securities had been acquired for approximately $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 first half of 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S4	The Partnership then collapsed the related MBS - TOB Trust 4 for approximately $6.0 million, MBS - TOB Trust 5 for approximately $5.3 million and MBS - TOB Trust 6 for approximately $7.8 million securitizing the related MBS.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P138_S5	The Partnership s approximate $19.1 million TOB financing facilities, which were the securitization of this MBS TOB Trusts, were paid off in full in connection with this sale (see Note 12).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P139_S0	The carrying value of the Partnership s MBS Securities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P140_S0	(1) MBS Securities are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P141_S0	(1) MBS Securities are reported based on the lowest rating issued by a Rating Agency, if more than one rating is issued on the security, at the date presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P142_S0	Valuation - The Partnership values each MBS Security based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P142_S1	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P142_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P143_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference of 7.5%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P143_S1	The Partnership also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S0	At December 31, 2015, the range of effective yields on the individual MBS Securities was 3.7% to 5.3% per annum.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S1	Additionally, the Partnership calculated the sensitivity of the key assumption used in calculating the fair values of the MBS Securities which is the effective yield on new issuances of similarly rated MBS Securities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S2	Assuming a 10% adverse change in that key assumption, the effective yields on the MBS Securities would increase to a range of 4.1% to 5.8% per annum and would result in additional unrealized losses on the bond portfolio of approximately $781,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S3	This sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S4	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P144_S5	Pricing services and the Partnership s analysis provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P145_S0	The MBS Securities are backed by residential mortgage loans and interest payable from the MBS Securities is believed and expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P145_S1	A description of certain terms of the Partnership s MBS Securities is as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S0	Real Estate Assets MF Properties To facilitate its investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, the Partnership has acquired through its subsidiary a 99% limited partner position in one limited partnership, 100% member positions in six limited liability companies that own the MF Properties, and owns one of the MF Properties directly.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S1	The financial statements of these properties are consolidated with those of the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S2	The general partners of these partnerships are unaffiliated parties and their 1% ownership interest in these limited partnerships is reflected in the Company s consolidated financial statements as noncontrolling interests.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S3	The Partnership expects each of these MF Properties to eventually be sold and the proceeds reinvested.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S4	As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries held interests in eight entities that own MF Properties containing a total of 2,217 rental units, one located in Kansas, two in Nebraska, one in Kentucky, one in Indiana, one in California, and two in Texas.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S5	In August 2015, the Partnership sold Glynn Place, an MF Property, for approximately $5.5 million and realized a gain of approximately $1.2 million, which was considered Tier 2 income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S6	In May 2015, the Partnership sold The Colonial property for approximately $10.7 million and realized a gain of approximately $3.4 million, which was considered Tier 2 income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P146_S7	The following tables represent information regarding the MF Properties owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P147_S0	Mortgage revenue bond exchange for an MF Property In September 2015, the owner of the Suites on Paseo property and the Partnership mutually agreed to exchange the deed for the Suites on Paseo property, a California property, in exchange for approximately $41.0 million Series A and B mortgage revenue bonds plus accrued interest.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P147_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds were subsequently collapsed (see Note 5).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P148_S0	million represented th e fair market value of the property plus the Suites on Paseo contributed approximately $200,000 in other current assets which resulted in a total of approximately $43.6 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P148_S1	This property has been included as an MF Property at December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P148_S2	A condensed balance sheet at the date of acquisition for the Suites on Paseo acquisition is below.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P149_S0	The Woodland Park property became an MF Property in May 2013 and was accounted for pursuant to the accounting guidance on business combinations.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P149_S1	The table below shows the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations of the Partnership as if the Suites on Paseo and Woodland Park had been acquired at the beginning of the periods presented:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S0	For the year ended December 2015, the Suites on Paseo added approximately $1.8 million in total revenue and approximately $1.0 million in net loss to the Partnership since the bond exchange on September 1, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S1	For the year ended December 2013, Woodland Park added approximately $1.0 million in total revenue and approximately $164,000 in net loss to the Partnership since the foreclosure on May 29, 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S2	The sales of the Consolidated VIEs were closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S3	No net income or loss from these properties operations or sale accrued to the Unitholders or the General Partner during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S4	For additional details see Notes 2, 4, 10, 21, and 22 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S5	During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Partnership purchased land in Panama City, Florida for approximately $2.9 million, and during the fourth quarter of 2014, the Partnership purchased land in St. Petersburg, Florida for approximately $3.0 million, to be held for investment and development.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S6	At December 31, 2015, the Partnership reported a total of approximately $7.4 million as land held for investment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P150_S7	The Partnership plans to develop this land into rental properties in the future.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P151_S0	Other Assets The Partnership had the following Other Assets as of dates shown:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P152_S0	In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, taxable property loans have been made to the owners of the properties which secure certain of the mortgage revenue bonds and are reported as Other Assets, net of allowance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P152_S1	The Partnership periodically, or as changes in circumstances or operations dictate, evaluates such taxable property loans for impairment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P152_S2	The value of the underlying property assets is ultimately the most relevant measure of the value to support the taxable property loan values.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P153_S0	The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P153_S1	A number of different discounted cash flow models containing varying assumptions are considered.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P153_S2	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates and multiple discount rates.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P154_S0	In estimating the property valuation, the most significant assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model were the same as those discussed in Note 2 above except the discount rate used to estimate the property valuation in the current year models was approximately 6.0% to 7.0%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P154_S1	The Partnership believes this represents a rate at which a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property could obtain current financing similar to the current existing outstanding bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P154_S2	Other information, such as independent appraisals, may be considered in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P154_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of any senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the balance of the property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is needed.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P155_S0	In October 2015, ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, committed to loan approximately $17.0 million to Vantage Capital Investors, LLC ( Vantage Capital ), an unrelated third party.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P155_S1	The money will be used to build a new 288 unit multifamily residential property in San Antonio, Texas and a new 288 unit multifamily residential property in New Braunfels, Texas.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S0	The notes are guaranteed by unrelated third parties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S1	The Partnership loaned approximately $7.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and reports these notes receivable in Other Assets on its consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S2	In June 2015, the Partnership purchased a $500,000 taxable mortgage revenue bond with an annual interest rate of 12.0%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S3	The taxable mortgage revenue bond matures on August 1, 2055 and is secured by Silver Moon Lodge Apartments, a 151 unit multifamily property located in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S4	In June 2015, the Partnership executed a loan agreement with Silver Moon Lodge LLLP, owner of the Silver Moon Lodge Apartments, for approximately $2.8 million which was repaid from the limited partner capital contributed to Silver Moon Lodge LLLP in December 2015 when the 4.0% LIHTCs were sold.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S5	In June 2014, the Partnership restructured twelve mortgage revenue bonds related to Avistar on the Boulevard, Avistar at Chase Hill, Avistar at the Crest, Avistar on the Hills Apartments, Avistar at the Oaks Apartments, and Avistar in 09 Apartments purchased in June and February 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S6	In connection with the mortgage revenue bond restructuring the Partnership loaned these entities approximately $526,000 to cover the costs of restructuring the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P156_S7	These taxable property loans have a stated interest rate of 12.0% per annum due monthly with any unpaid balance due on June 26, 2024.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P157_S0	The following is a summary of the taxable property loan s, accrued interest and allowance on amounts due at December 31, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P158_S0	In April 2015, the Partnership advanced approximately $567,000 to the Suites on Paseo for operations.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P158_S1	This amount was included as an investment in the Suites on Paseo in September 2015, which was eliminated upon consolidation.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P159_S0	Based on the annual impairment analysis, a provision for loan loss and an associated loan loss reserve of $75,000 and $168,000 was recorded against the Cross Creek taxable loan in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P159_S1	There was no provision for loan loss or associated loan loss reserve during 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P159_S2	The following is a detail of loan loss reserves for the years ended December 31:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P160_S0	Discontinued Operations In June 2010, the Partnership completed a sales transaction whereby the Ohio Properties were sold to three new ownership entities controlled by an unaffiliated not-for-profit entity and in October 2011, the three limited partnerships that own the Ohio Properties admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P160_S1	The BC Partners agreed to contribute equity to these limited partnerships, subject to the Ohio Properties meeting certain debt service coverage ratios specified in the applicable limited partnership agreements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S0	profit or BC Partners into the Ohio Prop erties to allow the Partnership to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S1	During the first quarter of 2013, BC Partners contributed $6.5 million of capital into the Ohio Properties which was sufficient to allow the Partnership to recognize the sale for accounting purposes.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S2	The deposit method of accounting for real estate sales required both the deferral of the gain from the real estate sale and also did not allow recognition of the interest payments by the Ohio Properties to the Partnership between June 2010 and the date of the equity contribution by BC Partners.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S3	In conjunction with the recognition of the real estate sale, approximately $3.5 million of interest was recognized as investment income during 2013 which represents interest payments received from the Ohio Properties between June 2010 and December 2012.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S4	In addition, the Partnership reported approximately $1.1 million in taxable note interest income received from the Ohio Properties and a $250,000 guarantee fee from the general partner of the Ohio Properties during the first quarter of 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P161_S5	The net fixed assets and total assets of the Ohio Properties were zero at December 31, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P162_S0	In October 2012, the limited partnership that owned the Greens Property admitted two entities that are affiliates of BC Partners as new limited partners as part of a syndication of LIHTCs on the Greens Property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P162_S1	That sale was conditional on securing the mortgage revenue bond and low-income housing tax credits from the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P162_S2	The July 2013 equity payment provided sufficient invested equity to recognize a real estate sale for accounting purposes and the Partnership recorded the sale of this discontinued operation.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P191_S0	Transactions with Related Parties A substantial portion of the Partnership s general and administrative expenses and certain costs capitalized by the Partnership are paid by AFCA 2 or an affiliate and are reimbursed by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P191_S1	The capitalized costs are typically incurred in connection with the acquisition or reissuance of certain mortgage revenue bonds, acquisition of PHC Certificates and MBS, debt financing transactions, and other capital transactions.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P191_S2	The amounts in the following table represent cash payments to reimburse AFCA 2 or an affiliate for such expenses.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S0	AFCA 2 is entitled to receive an administrative fee from the Partnership equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any of its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable property loans collateralized by real property, and other investments for which the owner of the financed property or other third party is not obligated to pay such administrative fee directly to AFCA 2.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S1	For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the Partnership paid administrative fees to AFCA 2 of approximately $2.6 million, $2.0 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S2	In addition to the administrative fees paid directly by the Partnership, AFCA 2 receives administrative fees directly from the owners of properties financed by certain of the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S3	These administrative fees also equal 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of these mortgage revenue bonds and totaled approximately $53,000, $138,000, and $144,000, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S6	Such fees are payable by the financed property prior to the payment of any contingent interest on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P192_S7	If the Partnership were to acquire any of these properties in foreclosure, it would assume the obligation to pay the administrative fees relating to mortgage revenue bonds on these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P193_S0	AFCA 2 earns mortgage placement fees in connection with the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P193_S1	These mortgage placement fees were paid by the owners of the respective property or the third party seller of the respective bonds and, accordingly, have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because these properties are not considered Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P193_S2	Investment/mortgage placement fees earned by AFCA 2 totaled approximately $1.9 million, $1.7 million, and $1.2 million, in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

1059142_16_ITEM8_P198_S0	Interest Rate Derivatives As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership has twelve derivative agreements in order to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates on its variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P198_S1	In addition, the Partnership entered into two interest rate swaps during 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P199_S0	The terms of the derivative agreements are as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P200_S0	In July 2015, to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate M33 TEBS financing, the Partnership entered into interest rate cap agreements with Wells Fargo Bank, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $28.1 million, which effectively limits the interest payable by the Partnership on the M33 TEBS Certificates to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 15, 2020.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P200_S1	The interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $573,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S0	On March 30, 2015, SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. revised and replaced an existing interest rate cap agreement with the notional amount of approximately $28.8 million for the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities to $11.0 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S1	This agreement effectively limit the interest component of the TOB financing correlated with the SIFMA index to a maximum of 1.0% on $52.3 mill ion of the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities and the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities through a three year term ending March 1, 2017.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S2	The Partnership received $10,500 of cash collateral upon the execution of the revised in terest rate cap agreement thus reducing its purchase price to approximately $151,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S3	The Partnership contracted for two interest rate swaps with DB related to the Decatur Angle and Bruton TOB financing facilities collateralized by mortgage revenue bonds that are used to provide financing for the construction of these properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S4	The swap related to the Decatur Angle TOB financing facility has a $23.0 million notional value, an October 15, 2016 effective date, and an October 15, 2021 termination date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S5	The swap related to the Bruton TOB financing facility has an approximate $18.1 million notional value, an April 15, 2017 effective date, and an April 15, 2022 termination date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S6	Both swaps are in place to mitigate the possible interest rate increases and swaps a variable rate based on LIBOR for an approximate 2.0% fixed rate.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S7	On December 31, 2015 the fair value of the Decatur Angle swap is a liability of approximately $737,000 and the fair value of the Bruton swap is a liability of approximately $580,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S8	The fair value of these swaps has been recorded as a liability on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S9	In July 2014, to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate M31 TEBS Financing, the Partnership entered into interest rate cap agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, each in an initial notional amount of approximately $31.6 million, which effectively limits the interest payable by the Partnership on the Class A M31 TEBS Certificates to a fixed rate of 3.0% per annum on the combined notional amounts of the interest rate cap agreements through August 15, 2019.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S10	The interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $991,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S11	In February 2014, the Partnership entered into two interest rate cap agreements with SMBC Capital Markets, Inc. for a notional amount of $70.0 million with an effective start date of March 1, 2014.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S12	These agreements effectively limit the interest component of the TOB financing correlated with the SIFMA index to a maximum of 1.0% on $70.0 million of the outstanding borrowings on the MBS TOB financing facilities and the PHC Certificates TOB financing facilities through a three year term ending March 1, 2017.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S13	These interest rate cap contracts cost approximately $390,000.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S14	These interest rate derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and, accordingly, they are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P201_S15	Interest rate derivative expense, which is the result of marking the interest rate derivative agreements to fair value, resulted in an increase of approximately $1.8 million, $2.0 million, and $284,000 in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P202_S0	These interest rate derivatives are presented on the balance sheet in Other Assets.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P202_S1	The carrying value of these derivatives was approximately $344,000 and $268,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P203_S0	The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of the Partnership s interest rate derivative agreements is disclosed in Note 17.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P204_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P205_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P206_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P207_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P207_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P208_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P209_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P210_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P211_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P211_S1	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S1	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analysis performed by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S2	There is no active trading market for the bonds and price quotes for the bonds are not available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S3	If available, the Partnership may also consider price quotes on similar bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S4	The estimates of the fair values of these bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P212_S5	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, the Partnership looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S1	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S3	The key inputs and methodology for determining the fair value of the forward bond purchase commitments are consistent with those used in determining the fair value of investments in mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S4	The fair market value of the Partnership s investment in forward bond purchase commitments is an asset reported in Other Assets of approximately $5.6 million and $5.8 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P213_S5	The estimated fair market value adjustments related to forward bond purchase commitments are categorized as Level 3 inputs which were recorded in other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S1	There is no active trading market for the trusts certificates owned by the Partnership but the Partnership will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S3	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S4	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with similar length of terms.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P214_S5	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P215_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in mortgage-backed securities is based upon prices obtained from a third party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P215_S1	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the market place, and other data inputs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P215_S2	The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P216_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service and ensuring they are within a tolerable range of difference which the Partnership estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P216_S1	The Partnership also looks at observations of trading activity observed in the market place when available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P216_S2	Given these facts, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s investment in mortgage-backed securities is categorized as Level 2 input.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P217_S0	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in taxable bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P217_S1	There is no active trading market for the taxable bonds and price quotes are not available.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P218_S0	The estimates of the fair values of these taxable bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P218_S1	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P219_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in taxable bonds between reporting periods, the Partnership looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P219_S1	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of the taxable bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P219_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in taxable bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P220_S0	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate caps is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P221_S0	Partnership s interest rate swaps are to change a variable rate debt oblig ation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P221_S1	The interest rate derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings within interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P222_S0	Th e fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P222_S1	The inputs in the valuation model include three-month LIBOR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for t he SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P223_S0	Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P224_S0	Income and losses included in earnings for the periods shown above are included in interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P225_S0	The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value given the short-term nature of these financial instruments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P225_S1	The Partnership calculates a fair market value of each financial instrument using a DCF model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P225_S2	The estimated fair value of the Debt financing and Mortgages payable are in the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P225_S3	B elow are the fair market value estimates of the debt held on the balance sheet for December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P226_S0	Commitments and Contingencies The Partnership, from time to time, may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P226_S1	These matters are frequently covered by insurance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P227_S0	If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is accrued in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P227_S1	While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, the Partnership believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P228_S0	As part of the Partnership s strategy of acquiring mortgage revenue bonds, the Partnership will enter into bond purchase commitments related to mortgage revenue bonds to be issued and secured by properties under construction.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P228_S1	Upon execution of the bond purchase commitment, the proceeds from the mortgage revenue bonds issued will be used to pay off the construction related debt and mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P228_S2	The Partnership bears no construction or stabilization risk during the commitment period.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P229_S0	The Partnership accounts for the following Bond Purchase Commitments as available-for-sale securities and, as such, records the estimated value of the Bond Purchase Commitments as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P229_S1	On December 31, 2015 and 2014 the Bond Purchase Commitments outstanding and the related fair values are as follows:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P230_S0	(1) The closing date is actual and estimated.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P231_S0	In October 2015, ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, committed to loan approximately $17.0 million to an unrelated third party to build two new multifamily residential properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P231_S1	The Partnership will fulfill its note commitment and fund approximately $9.3 million in 2016.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P231_S2	For additional details, see note 9 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P232_S0	The Partnership provided a guarantee on the $2.8 million mortgage obtained on the Abbington at Stones River, a 96 unit multifamily residential property located in Tennessee, in addition to providing an approximately $1.4 million taxable loan to Foundation for Affordable Housing, the not-for-profit owner of the property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P232_S1	Based on the financial performance of the property the Partnership estimates there is no value to record for this mortgage guarantee.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P233_S0	In connection with the sale of the Greens Property, the Partnership entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Partnership has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of the Greens of Pine Glen limited partnership, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P233_S1	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P233_S2	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurch ase event is remote.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P233_S3	The maximum exposure to the Partnership at December 31, 2015, under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $3.0 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners to date.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P233_S4	In connection with the Ohio Properties transaction in 2011, the Partnership entered into guarantee agreements with the BC Partners under which the Partnership has guaranteed certain obligations of the general partner of these limited partnerships, including an obligation to repurchase the interests of the BC Partners if certain repurchase events occur.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P234_S0	A repurchase event is defined as any one of a number of events mainly focused on the completion of the property rehabilitation, property rent stabilization, the delivery of LIHTCs, tax credit recapture and foreclosure.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P234_S1	No amount has been accrued for this contingent liability because the likelihood of a repurchase event is remote.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P234_S2	The maximum exposure to the Partnership at December 31, 2015, under the guarantee provision of the repurchase clause is approximately $4.8 million which represents 75% of the equity contributed by BC Partners.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P235_S0	As the holder of residual interests issued in connection with its TEBS and TOB bond financing arrangements, the Partnership is required to guarantee certain losses that can be incurred by the trusts created in connection with these financings.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P235_S1	These guarantees may result from a downgrade in the investment rating of mortgage revenue bonds held by the trust or of the senior securities issued by the trust, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates beyond pre-set maximums, an inability to re-market the senior securities or an inability to obtain liquidity for the trust.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P236_S0	In the case of the TEBS, Freddie will step in first on an immediate basis and the Partnership will have 10 to 14 days to remedy.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P236_S1	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P236_S2	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts, the Partnership will be required to fund any such shortfall pursuant to its guarantee.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P236_S3	In the event of a shortfall the maximum exposure to loss would be approximately $456.4 million prior to the consideration of the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P236_S4	The Partnership has never been required to reimburse the financing facilities for any shortfall.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P237_S0	In January and February 2016, the Partnership entered into a First and Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement which modified certain provisions of the May 2015 Credit Agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P237_S1	The First Amendment revises the definitions and reporting requirements and the Second Amendment increases the principal commitments with respect to the line of credit by $2.5 million, to a total commitment of $40.0 million.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S0	In January and February 2016, the Partnership executed two broker agreements to sell two of the MF Properties, Arboretum and Eagle Village.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S1	The Partnership expects to realize more than its net asset value investment for these MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S2	In January 2016, the Partnership acquired a Senior Series 2016 mortgage revenue bond with a par value of approximately $11.5 million, a stated annual interest rate of approximately 5.8%, a call feature on January 1, 2027, and a maturity date of January 1, 2052.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S3	The mortgage revenue bond is secured by Companion at Thornhill Apartments, a 180 unit multifamily apartment complex located in Lexington, South Carolina.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S4	In January 2016, the Partnership sold the remainder of its MBS Securities for approximating $15.0 million, approximately the outstanding amortized cost plus interest.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S5	The Partnership then collapsed the related three remaining MBS - TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S6	The Partnership s approximate $11.9 million TOB financing facilities, which were the securitization of these MBS TOB Trusts, were paid off in full in connection with this sale.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S7	In conjunction with the sale of the MBS Securities the related $11.0 million derivative was sold for its current value which resulted in no cash and no gain or loss.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P238_S8	The sale of the Partnership s remaining three MBS Securities eliminates this operating segment in the first quarter of 2016.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P239_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which revises this topic and will require a re-evaluation of lessee and lessor accounting models for capital and operating leases.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P239_S1	In addition, the guidance in ASU 2016-02 includes embedded lease arrangements, lease terms and incentives, sale-leaseback agreements, and related disclosures.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P239_S2	The guidance in ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P239_S3	The Partnership will apply this guidance retrospectively and is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P240_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10) , which amends this subtopic to simplify and clar ify the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P240_S1	The guidance in the ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P240_S2	The Partnership i s currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P241_S0	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805) , to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments in a business combination.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P241_S1	To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments in the ASU 2015-16 guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P241_S2	This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P241_S3	The Partnership will apply the guidance prospectively and does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P242_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , ASU 2015-14 supersedes the Update 2014-09 by extending the effective date for all entities by one year.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P242_S1	The guidance in ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P243_S0	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those goods or services.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S0	In August 2015 the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for public business entities was revised to annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S1	The Partnership decided not to elect the permitted early adoption and is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the Company s consolidated financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) , later clarified by ASU No. 2015-15.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S2	These change the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present such costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset and include lines of credit.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S3	Amortization of debt issuance costs will be reported as interest expense.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S4	This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P244_S5	The Partnership will adopt the guidance prospectively, beginning January 1, 2016, and does not expect the adoption will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P245_S0	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 Consolidation Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis which became effective for all fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P245_S1	The Partnership has reviewed and re-evaluated each entity which it holds a variable interest to identify if any of the variable interests have become reportable VIEs or Consolidated VIEs and concluded it will have no additional VIEs or Consolidated VIEs to report in 2016 (see Note 4).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S0	Segments Effective in the second quarter of 2015, the Company changed its reportable segments due to the classification of the Company s Consolidated VIEs as discontinued operations.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S1	As a result, the Company now consists of four reportable segments: Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, and MBS Securities Investments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S2	In addition to the four reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S3	During 2013 the Company consisted of five reportable segments, Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, MF Properties, Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts, MBS Securities Investments, and Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S4	In addition to the five reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P246_S5	The Consolidated VIE segment reported Lake Forest s revenue, interest expense, depreciation, net income from operations, and net income as a Consolidated VIE for 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P247_S0	The Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment consists of the Partnership s portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for the Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P247_S1	Such mortgage revenue bonds are held as long-term investments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P247_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership held sixty-four mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P247_S3	The Residential Properties financed by the 60 mortgage revenue bonds contain a total of 8,041 rental units.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P247_S4	Two of the bonds properties are not operational and are under construction and two bonds are collateralized by commercial real estate (see Note 5).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P248_S0	The MF Properties segment consists of indirect equity interests in multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential properties which are not currently financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership but which the Partnership eventually intends to finance by such bonds through a restructuring.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P248_S1	In connection with any such restructuring, the Partnership will be required to dispose of any equity interest held in such MF Properties.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P248_S2	The Partnership s interests in its current MF Properties are not currently classified as Assets Held for Sale because the Partnership is not actively marketing them for sale, there is no definitive purchase agreement in existence that, under current guidance, can be recognized as a sale of real estate assets and, therefore, no sale is expected in the next twelve months.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P248_S3	As discussed above, the Ohio Properties and the Greens Property were reported as discontinued operations in 2013 (see Note 10).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P249_S0	During the time the Partnership holds an interest in an MF Property, any net rental income generated by the MF Properties in excess of debt service will be available for distribution to the Partnership in accordance with its interest in the MF Property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P249_S1	Any such cash distribution will contribute to the Partnership s CAD.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P249_S2	As of December 31, 2015, the Partnership consolidated the results of eight MF Properties containing a total of 2,217 rental units (see Note 8).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P250_S0	Other Investments The Amended and Restated LP Agreement authorizes the Partnership to make investments in investments other than mortgage revenue bonds provided that these other investments are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by a national securities rating agency and do not constitute more than 25% of the Partnership s assets at the time of acquisition as required under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P250_S1	In addition, the amount of other investments are limited based on the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon for the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P250_S2	The Partnership currently has other investments, PHC Certificates and MBS Securities which are reported as two separate segments.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P251_S0	The PHC Trusts segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the PHC Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P251_S1	The Partnership consolidates the PHC Trusts due to its ownership of the LIFERS issued by the three PHC Trusts, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of local public housing authorities.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P251_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Capital Fund Program.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P251_S3	This investment has been reported as part of the Partnership balance sheet and results of operations since acquired in July 2012 (see Note 6).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P252_S0	The MBS Securities segment consists of the assets, liabilities, and related income and expenses of the MBS TOB Trusts that the Partnership consolidated due to its ownership of the LIFERs issued by the MBS TOB Trusts.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P252_S1	These MBS TOB Trusts are securitizations of state-issued mortgage-backed securities which are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P252_S2	These investments were acquired during the fourth quarter of 2012 through the second quarter of 2013 and all but three MBS Securities were sold in 2014 (see Note 7).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P253_S0	Consolidated VIE segment Historically, the Company also had the Consolidated VIE segment, which was comprised of the results of operations of the underlying collateral for the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P253_S1	The Company concluded its investment in the Consolidated VIE segment was not consistent with the Company s portfolio of assets (see Note 2).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P253_S2	As such, the Company decided to implement a strategic shift in direction by discontinuing its Consolidated VIE segment.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P253_S3	This decision was made for the following reasons:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P254_S0	The risk profile of the Consolidated VIE segment was unique as the substance of the investment was the result of the operations of the underlying properties and not the mortgage revenue bonds (which is the form of the investment).The risk profile includes:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P255_S0	The lack of ultimate decision-making authority.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P256_S0	The stated purpose of the Company was not to manage properties without having some type of ownership or ability to control the underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P257_S0	Subsequent to the disposition of the Consolidated VIE properties by their owners, the Company does not plan to include this type of investment as part of its strategic direction.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P258_S0	In April 2015, the Partnership entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P259_S0	The sales of the two Consolidated VIEs were closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of op erations of the Consolidated VIEs were reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P259_S1	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company s Consolidated VIEs are reported as discontinued operation on the Company s co nsolidated financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P259_S2	As of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company's two Consolidated VIEs are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations on the Company's consolidated financial statements (see Notes 2, 4, 8, 10, and 22).
1059142_16_ITEM8_P260_S0	The Consolidated VIE segment in 2013 consisted of the Lake Forest multifamily residential property financed with a mortgage revenue bond held by the Partnership, the assets, liabilities and operating results of which were consolidated with those of the Partnership in 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P260_S1	For part of the year ended December 31, 2013, the Consolidated VIE segment reported Lake Forest s revenue, interest expense, depreciation, net income from operations, and net income as a Consolidated VIE for 2013.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P260_S2	The mortgage revenue bonds on this Consolidated VIE property were eliminated from the Company s financial statements as a result of such consolidation, however, such bonds were held as long-term investments by the Partnership which continues to be entitled to receive principal and interest payments on such bonds.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P260_S3	The Company did not actually own an equity position in this Consolidated VIE or its underlying property.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P260_S4	During 2013, Lake Forest was sold to a not-for-profit entity and was deconsolidated pursuant to the consolidation guidance.
1059142_16_ITEM8_P261_S0	The following table details certain key financial information for the Company s reportable segments for the three years ended December 31:
1059142_16_ITEM8_P262_S0	The following table details total assets for the Company s reportable segments for the three years ended December 31:
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S0	Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S1	The CEO and CFO have determined that there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S2	The Company s management (including officers of the Burlington Capital Group LLC in its capacity as the general partner of the general partner of the Partnership) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S3	The Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO of The Burlington Capital Group LLC of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S4	The Company s management used the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) to perform this evaluation.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P0_S5	Based on that evaluation, the Company s management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P1_S0	The effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, a copy of which is included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S0	We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S1	The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S3	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S5	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P2_S6	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S0	A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S1	A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S2	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S3	Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S4	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
1059142_16_ITEM9A_P3_S5	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 of the Company and our report dated March 3, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding management s estimates for investments without readily determinable fair values.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P0_S0	The Partnership s General Partner is not elected by the Unitholders and is not subject to re-election on an annual or other continuing basis in the future.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P0_S1	In addition, our Unitholders are not entitled to elect the managers or executive officers of Burlington, or take part in the management or control of the business of the Partnership.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P1_S0	The Board of Managers of Burlington has eleven members.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P1_S1	The NASDAQ listing rules do not require a listed limited partnership, such as the Partnership, to have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Managers of the general partner of our General Partner or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P1_S2	We are, however, required to have an audit committee of at least three members, all of whom are required to meet the independence and experience standards established by the NASDAQ listing rules and SEC rules.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P1_S3	In this regard, a majority of the members of Burlington s Board of Managers and all the members of the Burlington Audit Committee have been determined to be independent under the applicable SEC and NASDAQ independence requirements.
1059142_16_ITEM10_P2_S0	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the current executive officers and managers of Burlington, and the sole executive officer of the Partnership, each of whom serves for a term of one year.

1059142_17_ITEM1_P1_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owns 83 mortgage revenue bonds with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $648.4 million as of December 31, 2016.

1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S0	One mortgage revenue bond is collateralized by commercial real estate located in Tennessee.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S1	Eighty-three of the mortgage revenue bonds are secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on the Residential Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S2	One mortgage revenue bond is secured by ground, facility, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S3	Each of the bonds provides for base interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S4	Additionally, the bonds may also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.

1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S6	Of the bonds owned, 30 are owned directly by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S7	Ten of the bonds are owned by ATAX TEBS I, LLC, 13 bonds are owned by ATAX TEBS II, LLC, and 9 bonds are owned by ATAX TEBS III, LLC.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S8	Two bonds are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) in Term Tender Option Bond ( Term TOB ) facilities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S9	Seventeen bonds are securitized and held by DB in Term A/B Trust financing facilities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P2_S10	See Notes 2 and 17 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P3_S0	The ability of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize our mortgage revenue bonds to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net cash flow generated by these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P4_S0	Net cash flow from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P5_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P6_S0	Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P6_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties which collateralize the bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S0	The return we realize from our investments in mortgage revenue bonds depends upon the economic performance of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize these bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S1	We may be considered to be in competition with other residential rental properties and commercial properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S2	We may also make taxable property loans secured by the Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S3	We do this to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in our best long-term interest.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S4	We may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by the America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as further amended (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ) and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that is relied upon by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S5	Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, any tax-exempt investments, other than mortgage revenue bonds, that are not secured by a direct or indirect interest in a property must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P7_S6	The acquisition by the Partnership of any tax-exempt investment or other investment may not cause the aggregate book value of such investments to exceed 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P8_S0	At December 31, 2016, we had one class of other tax-exempt investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts Certificates ( PHC Certificates ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P8_S1	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate carrying value of $56.8 million at December 31, 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P9_S0	The PHC Certificates are securitized into three separate TOB financing facilities ( TOB Trusts ) with DB ( PHC Trusts ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P9_S1	See Note 17 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P10_S0	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P10_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P10_S2	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P11_S0	We may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen apartment properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position ourselves for future investments in bonds issued to finance these properties and which we expect and believe will generate tax-exempt interest.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P12_S0	Kentucky, one in Indiana, one in California, one in Florida and two in Texas.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S0	In ad dition, we may acquire real estate securing our mortgage revenue bonds or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S1	To restructure each of the MF Properties into a mortgage revenue bond, we team with a third party developer who works to secure a mortgage revenue bond issuance from the local housing authority.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S2	Once the developer receives the mortgage revenue bond commitment, we will sell the MF Property to a not-for-profit entity or to a for profit entity in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S3	We expect to acquire the mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S4	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of our initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S5	We will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P13_S6	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, we will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what we believe is its optimal fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P14_S0	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC or other developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P14_S1	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for us and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P15_S0	In the first quarter of 2016, we sold our remaining three mortgage-backed securities ( MBS Securities ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P15_S1	The sale of the Partnership s MBS Securities eliminated the MBS Securities Investment reportable segment.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S0	In the second quarter of 2015, the property owners entered into brokerage contracts to sell Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S1	As a result, these entities met the criteria for discontinued operations and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S2	At that time, the Consolidated VIEs reportable segment was eliminated.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S3	At December 31, 2016, we have four reportable segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, (2) MF Properties, (3) Public housing Capital Fund Trust, and (4) Other Investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S4	In addition to the reportable segments, the Company also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P16_S5	See Note 26 to the Company consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S0	Seven of the 58 Residential Properties which collateralize the bonds owned by us are managed by Burlington Capital Properties, LLC ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership s general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or the General Partner ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S1	In this regard, Properties Management provides property management services for Ashley Square, Lake Forest Apartments, Cross Creek, Greens of Pine Glen (the Greens Property ), Crescent Village, Willow Bend and Post Woods (collectively, the Ohio Properties ), and each of the MF Properties, except for the Suites on Paseo.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S2	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to us and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC relating to these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S3	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital, (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our Unitholders which we believe are substantially exempt from federal income tax, and (iii) generate additional returns from appreciation of real estate or the opportunistic sale of the asset investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S4	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S5	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and net capital appreciation of the financed multifamily residential properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P17_S6	We expect and believe that any contingent interest we receive will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P18_S0	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments on a leveraged basis in order to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our Unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P18_S1	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments as permitted by the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P18_S2	We may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional units, lines of credit, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P18_S3	Our current operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage which will not exceed 65% of the total Partnership assets.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P19_S0	See the discussion of financing arrangements and liquidity and capital resources in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Op erations .
1059142_17_ITEM1_P20_S0	In connection with our business strategy, we continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P20_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our revenue bond portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S0	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected mortgage revenue bonds that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S1	Through the selective redemption of the bonds, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required, which if sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, may entitle us to receive payment of contingent interest on our bond investment.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S2	In other cases, we may elect to sell bonds on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S3	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S4	In executing our growth strategy, we expect to invest primarily in mortgage revenue bonds issued to provide affordable rental housing, student housing projects, housing for senior citizens, and commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P21_S5	The four basic types of mortgage revenue bonds which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_17_ITEM1_P22_S0	Each of these bond structures permits the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P22_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with mortgage revenue bonds that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P22_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the multifamily residential project may be rented at market rates (unless otherwise restricted by local housing authorities).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the bonds are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds that were secured by Residential Properties issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S2	There are no Treasury Regulations related to the mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by the commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S3	We expect that many of the private activity housing bonds that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed multifamily residential project.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S4	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S5	We expect to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P23_S6	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P24_S0	Investment Types Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_17_ITEM1_P24_S1	We invest in mortgage revenue bonds that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P24_S2	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P24_S3	Two of the mortgage revenue bonds currently owned by us also provide for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying multifamily residential properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P24_S4	As a result, the amount of interest earned by us from our investment in mortgage revenue bonds is a function of the net cash flow generated by the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P25_S0	Net cash flow from a residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P25_S1	Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P26_S0	We may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P27_S0	Any security acquired by the Partnership which is not secured by a direct or indirect interest in a property must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized rat ing agency.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P28_S0	These securities may not represent more than 25% of the total assets of the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S0	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S2	The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S3	The PHC Certificates rating by Standard Poor s is investment grade as of December 31, 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S4	We also invest in state-issued MBS Securities that are backed by residential mortgage loans.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S5	These MBS Securities were rated investment grade by Standard Poor s or Moody s as of December 31, 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S6	In January 2016, the Partnership sold its remaining MBS Securities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S7	See Note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S8	We also extend financing and direct equity investments in unconsolidated entities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P29_S9	See Notes 10 and 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P30_S0	We may also make taxable property loans secured by Residential Properties which are financed by mortgage revenue bonds that are held by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P30_S1	As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties to position ourselves for a future investment in mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such MF Properties by a new owner.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P30_S2	A new owner would typically seek to obtain LIHTCs in connection with the issuance of the new mortgage revenue bonds, but if LIHTCs had previously been issued for the property, such a restructuring could not occur until the expiration of a 15-year compliance period for the initial LIHTCs.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S0	We may acquire an interest in MF Properties prior to the end of the LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S1	After the LIHTC compliance period, we would expect to sell our interest in such MF Property to a new owner which could syndicate new LIHTCs and seek mortgage revenue bond financing on the MF Property which we could acquire.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S2	We will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S3	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a mortgage revenue bond, we will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what we believe is our optimal fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S4	The MF Property could be sold to any of the following: (1) a LIHTC or other developer, (2) a not-for-profit entity, or (3) a public finance authority.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P31_S5	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for us and will provide us with a pipeline of future bond investment opportunities.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P32_S0	Investment Opportunities and Business Challenges There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential housing in the United States.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P32_S1	HUD reports that there is a high demand for quality affordable housing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P32_S2	The types of mortgage revenue bonds in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P32_S3	Investors purchase these bonds because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P33_S0	The demand for affordable housing by qualified potential residents whose income does not exceed 50-60% of the area median income continues to increase.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P33_S1	Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents has not kept up with the demand, therefore programs that support private sector development and support for affordable housing through mortgage revenue bonds, tax credits and grant funding to developers have become more prominent.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P34_S0	In addition to mortgage revenue bonds, the federal government promotes affordable housing using LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P34_S1	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with mortgage revenue bond financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P34_S2	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P35_S0	We do not invest in LIHTCs, but are attracted to mortgage revenue bonds that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P36_S0	There are various requirements in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P37_S0	property s residential units for occupancy by households whose income is 50% or less (adjusted for family size) of the area median gross income.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P37_S1	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S0	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of mortgage revenue bonds through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S2	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S3	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the period) will result in lower economic occupancy at the related properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S4	The overall economic occupancy (which is adjusted to reflect rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units) of the stabilized Residential Properties that we have financed with mortgage revenue bonds was approximately 86%, 87% and 83% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P38_S5	The economic occupancy of the stabilized MF Properties was approximately 85%, 89%, and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P39_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional mortgage revenue bonds or other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, use of available lines of credit, with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds or other investments (including the securitization of these bonds), issuance of Preferred Units or the issuance of additional Beneficial Unit Certificates ( BUCs ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P40_S0	We utilize leverage to enhance investor rates of return.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P40_S1	We use target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us to manage an overall 65% leverage constraint.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P40_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P40_S3	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 65%.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S0	Our overall leverage ratio is calculated as total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the carrying value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, MBS Securities, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S1	At December 31, 2016, our leverage ratio was approximately 65%.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S2	There were no issuances of additional BUCs in 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S3	See Note 22 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for our ability to issue additional BUCs.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S4	We are authorized to issue up to $100 million of Series A Preferred Units through private placement.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S5	During 2016, the Partnership issued approximately 4.1 million Series A Preferred Units to four financial institutions resulting in approximately $40.9 million in gross proceeds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P41_S6	The Partnership will use the proceeds received to acquire mortgage revenue bonds that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, student housing, and commercial properties that are likely to receive consideration as qualified investments under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ( CRA ).
1059142_17_ITEM1_P42_S0	Recent Developments The following table presents information regarding the investment activity of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:

1059142_17_ITEM1_P46_S1	The Board of Managers and certain employees of Burlington act as directors and executive officers of the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P46_S2	Certain services are provided to us by employees of Burlington and we reimburse Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P46_S3	We are not charged, and do not reimburse Burlington, for the services performed by executive officers of Burlington.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P46_S4	As of December 31, 2016, the Partnership had no employees.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P47_S0	Competition We compete with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) and other entities with objectives similar to ours for the acquisition of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P47_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of investments to the Partnership for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S0	Because we hold mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, a commercial property, and hold interests in the MF Properties, we may be in competition with other real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the mortgage revenue bonds owned by us or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily rental properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S2	Multifamily rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S3	To compete effectively, the multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties financed or owned by us must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S4	To maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Residential Properties and MF Properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P48_S5	These Residential Properties and MF Properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P49_S0	We believe each of the MF Properties, the Residential Properties, and the commercial property comply, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P49_S1	We are not aware of any environmental contamination at any of these properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P50_S0	We are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, there is no provision for income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P50_S1	The distributive share of our income, deductions and credits is included in each Unitholder s income tax return.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P50_S2	We hold interests in all MF Properties except the Suites on Paseo and Jade Park through a subsidiary which is a C corporation for income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P50_S3	This subsidiary files separate federal and state income tax returns and its income is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P51_S0	We consolidate separate legal entities who record and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P51_S1	The Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks Consolidated VIEs results of operations were reported as discontinued operations for all periods as presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) reporting purposes and are separate legal entities for all years presented.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P52_S0	Form K-1, our ability to distribute income to Unitholders which we believe is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P53_S0	All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, with the exception of the Non-GAAP measure disclosed in Item 7.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P54_S0	The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P54_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P55_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as mortgage revenue bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and real estate properties, including multifamily, student and senior citizen housing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P56_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S0	The Partnership does not have any employees of its own.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through AFCA 2 (our general partner), are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S2	AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstandi ng principal balance of any mortgage revenue bonds, tax-exempt investments or other investments for which an unaffiliated party is not obligated to pay.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S3	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all ba se interest to the Partnership on the mortgage revenue bond on that property.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S4	Our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by us with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not pay able by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S5	In addition, our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that we will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S6	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees resulting from the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S7	In addition, an affiliate of AFCA 2, Farnam Capital Advisors, LLC ( FCA ), acts as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when mortgage revenue bonds, other investments and financing facilities are acquired by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S8	Any such fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired mortgage revenue bonds or other investments out of their proceeds.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S9	Any fees related to the origination of financing facilities are paid by the Trustee out of the gross proceeds of the financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P57_S10	The fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2, its affiliate, and such property owners.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P58_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P58_S1	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P58_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties financed by additional mortgage revenue bonds acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P58_S3	If we acquire ownership of any property through foreclosure of a revenue bond, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and receive a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P59_S0	The Partnership s sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P60_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third party investors.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P60_S1	Because each such outside third party effectively holds a share of the sole limited partner s rights and obligations as a limited partner, BUCs are also referred to herein as units for purposes of calculating amounts per BUC, and the holders thereof are referred to as Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P61_S0	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, other reports filed with the SEC and press releases issued are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_17_ITEM1_P61_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Cash distributions from us may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Currently cash distributions are made to its Unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for this purpose, as well as other factors it may deem to be relevant.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated Cash Available for Distribution of $0.50 and $0.53 per unit, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Although we may supplement our cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless we can increase our cash receipts through completion of our current investment plans, we may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if we complete our current investment plans.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our mortgage revenue bonds will be affected by the economic results of the underlying Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P2_S0	Although our mortgage revenue bonds are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P2_S1	Instead, each of these revenue bonds is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying Residential Properties and commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P3_S0	principal amount of the bond, is the net cash flow generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, (except in cases where a property owner has provid ed a limited guarantee of certain payments).
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P3_S1	This makes our investments in these mortgage revenue bonds subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P4_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level nece ssary to pay its debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a particular property are applied only to debt service payments of the particular mortgage revenue bond se cured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other mortgage revenue bonds that we hold.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P5_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future pro fitability.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P5_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our mortgage revenue bonds, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic result s of the underlying properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other similar multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential properties, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P6_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds are located, there is significant competition from other multifamily and single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P6_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P6_S3	The value of the properties is the only source of repayment of our mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal of most of our mortgage revenue bonds does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The mortgage revenue bonds are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Similarly, if a mortgage revenue bond goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will incur a loss.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P8_S0	In the event a property securing a mortgage revenue bond is not sold prior to the maturity or refinancing of the bond, any contingent interest payable from the net sale or refinancing proceeds of the underlying property will be determined on the basis of the appraised value of the underlying property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P8_S1	Real estate appraisals represent only an estimate of the value of the property being appraised and are based on subjective determinations, such as the extent to which the properties used for comparison purposes are comparable to the property being evaluated and the rate at which a prospective purchaser would capitalize the cash flow of the property to determine a purchase price.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Accordingly, such appraisals may result in us realizing less contingent interest from a mortgage revenue bond than we would have realized had the underlying property been sold or refinanced.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The taxable property loans that we make to owners of the Residential Properties that secure mortgage revenue bonds held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable property loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bond secured by the same property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, there is a higher risk of default on the taxable property loans than on the associated mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P11_S1	While these taxable property loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, we do not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable property loan if the property is not in default on the mortgage revenue bonds financing the property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future bond financings of these projects.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P12_S1	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional mortgage revenue bonds secured by Residential Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our plan is to provide mortgage revenue bond financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions, including the potential for corporate tax reform in the U.S.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S0	interest in these MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S1	I n addition, the value of our interest in these MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S2	As a result, we may incur a loss upon the sale of our interest in an MF Property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S3	In addition, we may not be able to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S4	During the time we own an interest in an MF Property, any net income w e receive from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S5	Any future issuances of additional units could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S6	We may issue additional units from time to time to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S7	The issuance of additional units may cause dilution of the existing units and may cause a decrease in the market price of the units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P14_S8	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P15_S1	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P15_S2	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with specific interest rate indices.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P15_S3	Our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P15_S4	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to Unitholders and may affect the market value of our units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P16_S0	Our use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P16_S1	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the market value of assets owned by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P16_S2	A decrease in the market value of assets owned by the Partnership could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P16_S3	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new interest-bearing assets we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of interest-bearing assets.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P16_S4	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional interest-bearing assets through the issuance of additional BUC s, from the issuance of preferred units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing assets held by the Partnership and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional interest-bearing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S0	High interest rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance our debt obligations, which could reduce the number of investments we can acquire, our cash flow from operations and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S1	If debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance the purchase of additional investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S2	If we place debt on our investments, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the debt when it becomes due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S3	If interest rates are higher when we refinance, our income could be reduced.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S4	We may be unable to refinance our debt obligations.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S5	If any of these events occurs, our cash flow would be reduced.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P17_S6	This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more stock or borrowing more money.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S1	We use derivative instruments to mitigate some, but not all, of the risks to which we are exposed from changing interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S2	There is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate us from the interest rate risks to which we are exposed.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S3	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and these costs may not ultimately exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S4	There is also a risk that the counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S5	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a derivative position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S6	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P18_S7	This can result in significant period to period volatility in our reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P19_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve sec uritization of our mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P19_S2	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our investment assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P19_S3	The trust or other entity receives all the interest payments from its underlying mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable or fixed rate.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P19_S4	As the holder of the residual interest, we are entitled to any remaining interest received by the trust holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents, credit providers, and liquidity providers.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P20_S0	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following: Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P21_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P21_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P21_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less interest available to us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P21_S3	Higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, our return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P21_S4	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and there are no party guarantees to the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P22_S0	We hold a residual interest (known as Class B interests in the TEBS Financing with Freddie Mac, Term TOB Trust and Term A/B Trust facilities with Deutsche Bank and residual participating interests ( LIFER s) in the TOB financing facilities) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P22_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P22_S2	As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to us as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P22_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, we can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P22_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for many reasons which could cause us to lose the assets and other collateral we pledged for such financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for many different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain credit or liquidity for the trust.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S4	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the mortgage revenue bonds and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S5	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then we will be required, through our guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S6	The Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose our investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses in order to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S7	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair our ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S8	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P23_S9	In that situation, it is possible that we would not be able to recover the investment assets and other collateral it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by us in such trust or other entity.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P24_S0	Conditions in the tax credit markets due to potential changes in U.S. corporate tax rates may increase our cost of borrowing, make financing dif ficult to obtain or restrict our ability to invest in mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P24_S1	Conditions in the tax credit market due to the potential changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our cost of borrowings and may restrict our ability to invest in mortgage revenue bonds and other investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P24_S2	It is unclear when and how quickly conditions will stabilize in the tax credit markets.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P24_S3	These conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Concern about the stability of the tax credit markets has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, providing funding to borrowers.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P25_S1	Our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P25_S2	If the tax credit market and the potential decrease in U.S. tax rates is realized, they may limit our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis, may impair our ability to acquire mortgage revenue bonds and other investments and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Federal regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may require us to unwind our tender option bond financing facilities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S0	The Volcker Rule adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 limits the ability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain types of covered funds (such as private equity funds and hedge funds) or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading in the U.S.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S1	The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with certain covered funds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S2	As currently structured, TOB Trusts like those used as part of our TOB financing program with DB, fit within the definition of covered funds and will be affected by the Volcker Rule.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S3	The Volcker Rule does not apply to Freddie Mac or more specifically, the M33, M31 and M24 TEBS Financing facilities with Freddie Mac.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S4	The regulators specifically noted that banks will need to evaluate if TOB Trusts are, in fact, covered funds and if so, whether an exception to the definition is available.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S5	The regulators declined to provide a specific exclusion from the definition of covered funds for TOB financing programs.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S6	The preamble also notes that participation in a TOB transaction is not prohibited per se, but is subject to the same restrictions on other covered funds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P27_S7	The rule provides for a phase in period during which time banks need to make good faith efforts to have full compliance with the rule by July 21, 2017, provided that the interest in the covered fund was established prior to December 31, 2013.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P28_S0	Any downgrade, or perceived potential of a downgrade, of U.S. sovereign credit ratings or the credit ratings of the U.S. Government-sponsored entities (or GSEs) by the various credit rating agencies may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P28_S1	Our TEBS Financing facilities are an integral part of our business strategy and those financings are dependent upon an investment grade rating of Freddie Mac.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P28_S2	If Freddie Mac were downgraded to below investment grade, it would have a negative effect on our ability to finance our bond portfolio on a longer-term basis and could negatively impact Cash Available for Distribution and our ability to continue distributions at current levels.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P28_S3	The federal conservatorship of Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P29_S0	The problems faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commencing in 2008 resulting in them being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant U.S. Government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S. Government in providing liquidity and credit enhancement for mortgage loans.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P29_S1	The Trump administration has publicly indicated a desire to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including their relationship with the federal government.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P29_S2	As a result, the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are likely to be reduced (perhaps significantly) and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P29_S3	Alternatively, it is still possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be dissolved entirely or privatized, and, as mentioned above, the U.S. Government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P30_S0	Any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guarantee obligations could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P30_S1	If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to be eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guarantee obligation), our ability to utilize TEBS Financings facilities could be materially and adversely impacted.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certifi cates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P31_S2	There are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P31_S3	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing mortgage revenue bonds and we do not expect to obtain ratings on mortgage revenue bonds we may acquire in the future.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P31_S4	Accordingly, any buyer of these mortgage revenue bonds would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The Partnership s ability to sell its mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities and the price it may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and by other market conditions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P32_S1	Such a sale could result in a loss to the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Delay, reduction, or elimination of appropriations from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can result in payment defaults on our investments in PHC Trusts.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S0	We have acquired interests, LIFERS, in three PHC TOB Trusts, which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S2	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S3	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S4	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by us from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S5	A reduction in the rating of PHC Certificates below investment grade would result in the liquidation of the investment in that TOB Trust Our investment in PHC Certificates is made pursuant to the provision of our Amended and Restated LP Agreement that allows investment in securities that are not mortgage revenue bonds backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and provide what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S6	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee of the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P34_S7	Accordingly, we would be required to liquidate our LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Likewise, if we liquidate the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P35_S2	The partnership may not be able to divest its position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S1	All of the Residential Properties securing our mortgage revenue bonds and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate income persons or families.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S3	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S4	This may force the property owner to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P36_S5	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner s ability to service its debt.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The properties financed by certain of our mortgage revenue bonds are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Two of the multifamily housing properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us and one MF Property are in an area prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P37_S2	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property s value.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P37_S3	In general, the current insurance policies on the property financed by us that is located in an area rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a five percent deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P38_S0	either of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant and the property owner may not have the resources to full y rebuild the property, which could result in a default on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P38_S1	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Unless a prope rty owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on our mortgage revenue bonds collateralized by these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P38_S3	The properties securing our revenue bonds or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P40_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our mortgage revenue bonds or the MF Properties, in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P40_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S0	If we acquire ownership of Residential Properties, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S1	We may acquire ownership of Residential Properties financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S2	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of mortgage revenue bonds on these MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S3	In either case, during the time we own an MF Property, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S4	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates, increases in operating expenses, and the ability to refinance if needed.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P41_S5	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and ability to make distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P42_S0	There are many risks related to the construction of Residential Properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P43_S0	We may invest in mortgage revenue bonds secured by residential housing properties which are still under construction.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P43_S1	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P44_S0	The principal risk associated with construction lending is that construction of the property will be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P44_S1	This may occur for many reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P44_S2	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P44_S3	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If a property is not completed, or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the mortgage revenue bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable property loan.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any return on this additional investment would be taxable.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P45_S5	The overall return to us from our investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There are many risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may acquire mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk that these investments may go into default than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P48_S0	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased up to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P49_S0	We have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P49_S1	We have acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P49_S2	When we acquire an interest in an MF Property, it generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after we acquired our interest in the MF Property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P49_S3	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial and could negatively impact the financial performance of the MF Property.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P50_S0	We are not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P50_S1	We are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because we operate under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P50_S2	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P51_S0	We engage in transactions with related parties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S0	Each of the executive officers of Burlington and four of the managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as our General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our mortgage revenue bonds or by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for some of the Residential Properties that underlie our mortgage revenue bonds and each of our MF Properties and earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own two of the Residential Properties financed with mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans held by us are employees of Burlington who are not involved in our operation or management and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S4	These two Residential Properties are Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, which were sold during 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S5	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S6	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm s length.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P52_S7	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P53_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our mortgage revenue bonds or PHC Certificates is determined to be taxable.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P53_S1	In each mortgage revenue bond transaction, the governmental issuer, as well as the underlying borrower, has covenanted and agreed to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements necessary to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest earned on the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P53_S2	Failure to comply with such requirements may cause interest on the related issue of bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P54_S0	Should the interest income on a mortgage revenue bond be deemed to be taxable, the bond documents include a variety of rights and remedies that we have concluded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P54_S1	Under such circumstances, we would enforce all of such rights and remedies as set forth in the related bond documents as well as any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P54_S2	In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any mortgage revenue bond is challenged by the IRS, we would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and would, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P54_S3	The loss of tax-exemption for any particular issue of bonds would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated issue of bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P54_S4	However, the loss of such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our Unitholders of taxable income relating to such bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P55_S0	Certain of our mortgage revenue bonds bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P55_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by, and net proceeds realized from a sale of, the property securing the bond.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P55_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and the Partnership is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P55_S3	If the IRS were to determine that these mortgage revenue bonds represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P56_S0	payment of interest on senior securities and related expenses issued by the trust.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P56_S1	It is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Not all the income received by us is exempt from taxation.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S1	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable property loans to the owners of Residential Properties that collateralize our investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S2	The interest income earned by us on these taxable property loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S3	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a mortgage revenue bond or a taxable property loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S4	In that case, the taxable income received by us will be allocated to our Unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is distributed to Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S5	If we were determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for us and our Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S6	We have determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S7	The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for us and allow us to pass through our interest income which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt to our Unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S8	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is successfully challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S9	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by us to Unitholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of our earnings and profits.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S10	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by us.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P57_S11	The listing of our units for trading on the NASDAQ causes us to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held to produce interest or dividends, and certain other items.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S2	We expect and believe that substantially all of our gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on our mortgage revenue bonds, but there can be no assurance that will be the case.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S4	In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, we will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S6	To the extent we generate taxable income; Unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S7	As a partnership, our Unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by us, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S8	There are limits on the ability of our Unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P58_S9	The ability of Unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by us will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for Unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Holders of the Series A Preferred Units may be required to bear the risks of an investment for an indefinite period of time.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Holders of the Series A Preferred Units may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Preferred Units for an indefinite period of time.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, the Series A Preferred Units will rank junior to all Partnership current and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under the Partnership s senior bank credit facility) and other liabilities, and any other senior securities we may issue in the future with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to existing and future debt obligations, and the interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional units, including additional Series A Preferred Units, and by other transactions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P59_S4	The Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, including indebtedness outstanding under any senior bank credit facility.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P60_S0	The Partnership may incur additional debt under its senior bank credit facility or future credit facilities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P60_S1	The payment of principal and interest on its debt reduces cash available for distribution to Unitholders, including the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P61_S0	The issuance of additional units pari passu with or senior to the Series A Preferred Units would dilute the interests of the ho lders of the Series A Preferred Units, and any issuance of senior securities, parity securities, or additional indebtedness could affect the Partnership s ability to pay distributions on or redeem the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P62_S0	Holders of Series A Preferred Units have extremely limited voting rights.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S0	The voting rights as a holder of Series A Preferred Units will be extremely limited.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Our BUCs are the only class of our partnership interests carrying full voting rights.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S2	Holders of Series A Preferred Units generally have no voting rights.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S3	There is no public market for the Series A Preferred Units, which may prevent an investor from liquidating its investment.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S4	The Series A Preferred Units have been, and are being offered in a private placement and the Partnership has not registered the Series A Preferred Units with the SEC or any state securities commission.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S5	The Series A Preferred Units may not be resold unless the Partnership registers the securities with the SEC or an exemption from the registration requirement is available.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S6	It is not expected that any market for the Series A Preferred Units will develop or be sustained in the future.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P63_S7	The lack of any public market for the Series A Preferred Units severely limits the ability to liquidate the investment, except for the right to put the Series A Preferred Units to the Partnership under certain circumstances.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P64_S0	Market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P64_S1	One of the factors that will influence the value of the Series A Preferred Units will be the distribution rate on the Series A Preferred Units (as a percentage of the price of the units) relative to market interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P64_S2	An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lower the value of the Series A Preferred Units and also would likely increase the Partnership s borrowing costs.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P64_S3	Holders of Series A Preferred Units may have liability to repay distributions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P64_S4	Under certain circumstances, holders of the Series A Preferred Units may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause the Partnership s liabilities to exceed the fair value of its assets.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P66_S0	Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P66_S1	A purchaser of Series A Preferred Units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the Partnership that are known to such purchaser of units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from our Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P67_S0	The Partnership s portfolio investment decisions may create CRA strategy risks.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P67_S1	Portfolio investment decisions take into account the Partnership s goal of holding mortgage revenue bonds and other securities in designated geographic areas and will not be exclusively based on the investment characteristics of such assets, which may or may not have an adverse effect on the Partnership s investment performance.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P67_S2	CRA qualified assets in geographic areas sought by the Partnership may not provide as favorable return as CRA qualified assets in other geographic areas.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P67_S3	The Partnership may sell assets for reasons relating to CRA qualification at times when such sales may not be desirable, and may hold short-term investments that produce relatively low yields pending the selection of long-term investments believed to be CRA-qualified.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P68_S0	Under certain circumstances, investors may not receive CRA credit for their investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P69_S0	The CRA requires the three federal bank supervisory agencies, the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC, to encourage the institutions they regulate to help meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P69_S1	Each agency has promulgated rules for evaluating and rating an institution s CRA performance which, as the following summary indicates, vary according to an institution s asset size.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P69_S2	An institution s CRA performance can also be adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory credit practices regardless of its asset size.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S0	For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to an investment in the Series A Preferred Units, the Partnership mus t hold CRA-qualifying investments that relate to the institution s delineated CRA assessment area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S1	The Partnership expects that an investment in its units will be considered a qualified investment under the CRA, but neither the Partnership nor the General Partner has received an interpretative letter from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC ) stating that an investment in the Partnership is considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S2	Moreover, there is no guarantee that future changes to the CRA or future interpretations by the FFIEC will not affect the continuing eligibility of the Partnership s investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S3	So that the Partnership itself may be considered a qualified investment, the Partnership will seek to invest only in investments that meet the prevailing community investing standards put forth by U.S. regulatory agencies.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S4	In this regard, the Partnership expects that a majority of its investments will be considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA, but there is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for its investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P70_S5	For example, a state banking regulator may not consider the Partnership eligible for regulatory credit.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P71_S0	If CRA credit is not given, there is a risk that an investor may not fulfill its CRA requirements.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P71_S1	The assets held by the Partnership may not be considered qualified investments under the CRA by the bank regulatory authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P71_S2	In most cases, qualified investments, as defined by the CRA, are required to be responsive to the community development needs of a financial institution s delineated CRA assessment area or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the institution s assessment area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S0	For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to the Series A Preferred Units, the Partnership must hold CRA qualifying investments that relate to the institution s assessment area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S1	As defined in the CRA, qualified investments are any lawful investments, deposits, membership shares, or grants that have as their primary purpose community development.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S2	The term community development is defined in the CRA as: (1) affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) community services targeted to low- or moderate-income individuals; (3) activities that promote economic development by financing businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of 13 C.F.R. 121.802(a)(2) and (3) or have gross annual revenues of $1 million or less; or (4) activities that revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income geographies, designated disaster areas, or distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income geographies designated by the federal banking regulators.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S3	Investments are not typically designated as qualifying investments at the time of issuance by any governmental agency.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S4	Accordingly, the General Partner must evaluate whether each potential investment may be qualifying investments with respect to a specific Unitholder.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S5	The final determinations that assets held by the Partnership are qualifying investments are made by the federal and, where applicable, state bank supervisory agencies during their periodic examinations of financial institutions.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P72_S6	There is no assurance that the agencies will concur with the General Partner s evaluation of any of the Partnership s assets as qualifying investments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P73_S0	Each investor will be a limited partner of the Partnership, not just of the investments in its Designated Target Region(s).
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P73_S1	The financial returns on an investor s investment will be determined based on the performance of all the assets in the Partnership s geographically diverse portfolio, not just by the performance of the assets in the Designated Target Region(s) selected by the investor.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P73_S2	In determining whether a particular investment is qualified, the General Partner will assess whether the investment has as its primary purpose community development.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The General Partner will consider whether the investment: (1) provides affordable housing for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) provides community services targeted to low- to moderate-income individuals; (3) funds activities that (a) finance businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of the Small Business Administration s Development Company or Small Business Investment Company programs or have annual revenues of $1 million or less and (b) promote economic development; or (4) funds activities that revitalize or stabilize low- to moderate-income areas.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P73_S4	For institutions whose primary regulator is the FRB, OCC, or FDIC, the General Partner may also consider whether an investment revitalizes or stabilizes a designated disaster area or an area designated by those agencies as a distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P74_S0	An activity may be deemed to promote economic development if it supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement for persons who are currently low- to moderate-income, or supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement in low- to moderate-income areas targeted for redevelopment by federal, state, local, or tribal governments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P75_S0	Activities that revitalize or stabilize a low- to moderate-income geography are activities that help attract and retain businesses and residents.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P76_S0	The General Partner maintains documentation, readily available to a financial institution or an examiner, supporting its determination that a Partnership asset is a qualifying investment for CRA purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P77_S0	There may be a time lag between sale of the Series A Preferred Units and the Partnership s acquisition of a significant volume of investments in a particular geographic area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The length of time will depend upon the depth of the market for CRA qualified investments in the relevant areas.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P78_S0	In others, it may take weeks or months to acquire a significant volume of CRA qualified investments in a particular area.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P78_S1	The General Partner believes that investments in the Series A Preferred Units during these time periods will be considered CRA qualified investments, provided the purpose of the Partnership includes serving the investing institution s assessment area(s) and the Partnership is likely to achieve a significant volume of investments in the region after a reasonable period of time.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P78_S2	As the Partnership continues to operate, it may dispose of assets that were acquired for CRA qualifying purposes, in which case the General Partner will normal ly attempt to acquire a replacement asset that would be a qualifying investment.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Obligations of U.S. Government agencies, authorities, instrumentalities, and sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P79_S1	However, the maximum potential liability of the issuers of some of these securities may greatly exceed their current resources and no assurance can be given that the U.S. Government would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so by law.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P80_S0	The investment in the Series A Preferred Units is not a deposit or obligation of, or insured or guaranteed by, any entity or person, including the U.S. Government and the FDIC.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P80_S1	An investment in the Partnership may be particularly appropriate for banks and other financial institutions that are subject to the CRA; institutional investors, such as pension plans, that find the Partnership meets their asset management needs; and socially responsible investors who desire to channel their investments in ways that help communities.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P81_S0	The value of the Partnership s assets will vary, reflecting changes in market conditions, interest rates, and other political and economic factors.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P81_S1	There is no assurance that the Partnership can achieve its investment objective, since all investments are inherently subject to market risk.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P81_S2	There also can be no assurance that either the Partnership s investments or units of the Partnership will receive investment test credit under the CRA.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S0	The Partnership faces legislative and regulatory risks in connection with its assets and operations, including under the CRA.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S1	Many aspects of the Partnership s investment objectives are directly affected by the national and local legal and regulatory environments.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S2	Changes in laws, regulations, or the interpretation of regulations could all pose risks to the successful realization of the Partnership s investment objectives.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S3	It is not known what changes, if any, may be made to the CRA in the future and what impact these changes could have on regulators or the various states that have their own versions of the CRA.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S4	Changes in the CRA might affect Partnership operations and might pose a risk to the successful realization of the Partnership s investment objectives.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S5	In particular, repeal of the CRA would significantly reduce the attractiveness of an investment in the Partnership s units for regulated investors.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S6	There is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for is investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S7	If CRA credit is not given, there is a risk that an investor may not fulfill its CRA obligations.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S8	We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber-attacks, security problems, and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S9	We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S10	If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S11	If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S12	In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation risks, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information or from systems conversions when, and if, they occur in the normal course of business.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S13	The inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S14	Negative posts or comments about the Partnership on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P82_S15	In addition, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P83_S0	Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges.
1059142_17_ITEM1A_P83_S1	Any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our BUCs.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are collateralized by the Residential Properties or commercial property.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership may have property loans that are also collateralized by the Residential Properties, but does not hold title or any other interest in these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S2	At December 31, 2016, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership held interests in one entity that owns an MF Property, Northern View.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S3	The wholly-owned subsidiary also owns four MF Properties Residences of DeCordova, Eagle Village, Residences of Weatherford, and The 50/50.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S4	In addition, the Partnership owns the Suites on Paseo, Jade Park and land held for development directly.
1059142_17_ITEM2_P0_S5	The Partnerships Real Estate Assets at December 31, 2016 are:
1059142_17_ITEM5_P0_S0	The Partnership s BUCs trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ATAX.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P0_S1	On March 2, 2017, the closing price of our BUCs, as reported on the NASDAQ was $5.70.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P0_S2	The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low intraday sales prices of our BUCs and the distributions paid by us in each of the periods listed.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P1_S0	(1) Represents distributions declared, on a per unit basis, with respect to that quarter Stockholder Information As of December 31, 2016, we had 60,066,234 BUCs outstanding held by a total of approximately 12,000 Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P1_S1	The Partnership also has unvested restricted unit awards for 158,304 BUCs held by 9 individuals.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P1_S2	Distributions Future distributions paid by the Partnership on the BUCs will be at the discretion of the Board of Managers and will be based upon financial, capital, and cash flow considerations.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P1_S3	In addition, distributions on the BUCs rank junior to distributions on the Series A Preferred Units, and, therefore, such distributions may be considered to be limited under certain circumstances.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P1_S4	See note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for a further description.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P2_S0	Distributions by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows (amounts in thousands, except per unit amounts):
1059142_17_ITEM5_P3_S0	The following table provides information with respect to compensation plans under which equity securities of the Partnership are currently authorized for issuance as of December 31, 2016:
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S0	Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities The Partnership did not sell any of its BUCs in 2016, 2015, or 2014 which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S1	During 2016, the Partnership sold 4,086,900 Series A Preferred Units, the information for which the Partnership previously disclosed in Current Reports on Form 8-K. On August 24, 2016, the Partnership announced that the Board of Managers of Burlington, which is the general partner of the Partnership s general partner, authorized a unit repurchase program for up to 272,307 of the Partnership s outstanding BUCs.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S2	Under the terms of the repurchase program, BUCs may be repurchased from time to time at the Partnership s discretion on the open market, through block trades, or otherwise, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S3	The program does not have a stated expiration date and will continue until all of the BUCs authorized under the program have been repurchased, or the program is otherwise modified or terminated by the Board in its sole discretion.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S4	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Partnership repurchased 272,307 BUCs under the program for approximately $1.6 million.
1059142_17_ITEM5_P4_S5	Information on the BUCs repurchased during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 under the program is as follows:

1059142_17_ITEM7_P1_S1	The Company includes the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the Partnership, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and two other consolidated entities in which we do not hold an ownership interest and which are treated as VIEs of which we have been determined to be the primary beneficiary, the Consolidated VIEs.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P1_S3	All significant transactions and accounts between us and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P1_S4	See Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P2_S0	Executive Summary The Partnership was formed for the primary purpose of acquiring a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties in their market areas.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P2_S1	We expect and believe the interest received on these bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P23_S0	The slight decrease in total revenues when comparing 2015 to 2014 was the result of the principal reductions of the PHC Certificates owned by us.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P23_S1	The slight increase in net income when comparing the same periods was related to less interest expense incurred due to the reduction of approximately $610,000 in related PHC TOB Trust financing.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P33_S0	The net increase in net income is due to the changes in revenues, other income and interest expense described above.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P33_S1	In additio n, the following changes to general real estate operating expenses contributed to the change in net income:

1059142_17_ITEM7_P35_S2	The increase in net income for 2015, as compared to 2014 is attributable, for the most part, to a gain of approximately $4.6 million reported on the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial in 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P35_S3	Excluding these 2015 gains the majority of the increase in the loss 2015 as compared to 2014 was attributable to the property operations after the completion of The 50/50 MF Property in August 2014 and the Suites on Paseo was added to the MF Properties in September 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P36_S0	During 2015, The 50/50 MF Property began to accrue real estate taxes and the Suites on Paseo incurred one time acquisition and accrued expenses.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P46_S0	Non-Consolidated Properties - Stabilized The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE and/or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P46_S1	As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P46_S2	For the year ended December 31, 2016, these Residential Properties have met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table).

1059142_17_ITEM7_P48_S0	Physical occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P48_S1	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P48_S2	(3) A property is considered stabilized once it reaches 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P50_S1	Overall physical occupancy decreased from 2014 to 2015 due to the addition of the Concord at Gulfgate, Concord at Little York, and Concord at Williamcrest properties in 2015 that did not stabilize until 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P50_S2	Overall economic occupancy decreased slightly from 2015 to 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P50_S3	The decrease is due primarily to the recent stabilization of Bruton Apartments and Decatur Angle during 2016, which had no comparable prior year information.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P50_S4	Overall economic occupancy increased from 2014 to 2015 due to improved economic occupancy in the Avistar portfolio of properties that stabilized in 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P50_S5	Non-Consolidated Properties - Not Stabilized The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P52_S0	Physical occupancy is a point in time measure while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P52_S1	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P52_S2	(3) During 2016, these properties were under construction or renovation.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P52_S3	As such, these properties are not considered stabilized as they have not met the criteria for stabilization.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P53_S0	Stabilization is generally defined as 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P53_S5	Physical and economic occupancy increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the addition of non-stabilized Residential Properties with high occupancy in 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P53_S6	These new Residential Properties may show a decline in physical and economic occupancy in the near term as the properties go through substantial rehabilitations.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P53_S7	There is no comparable data for the non-stabilized Residential Properties in 2014 since they were either under significant renovations or were new investments made in 2015 or 2016.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P56_S1	(2) Economic occupancy is presented for December 31, 2015 and 2014, and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P56_S2	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P96_S1	The financing arrangements generally involve the securitization of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments into trusts whereby we retain beneficial interests in the trusts that provide certain rights to the underlying investment assets.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P96_S2	The remaining beneficial interests are sold to unaffiliated parties with the proceeds being received by the Partnership.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P98_S1	The per unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by us from our portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds and other investments, the amount of our outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by us on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by us, and the number of units outstanding.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P99_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the leverage program utilized, constraints of market collateral calls and the liquidity and marketability of the underlying collateral of the asset being leveraged.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P100_S0	We defined our leverage constraint as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using the carrying value of the mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates, initial finance costs and the MF Properties at cost.

1059142_17_ITEM7_P101_S0	In fiscal 2016, we generated $3.7 million of cash, which was the net result of $15.2 million provided by operating activities, $83.1 million used in investing activities, and $71.5 million provided by financing activities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P102_S0	Cash provided by operating activities totaled $15.2 million in 2016, as compared to $19.4 million generated in 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P102_S1	The decrease was mainly driven by a $2.7 million decrease in 2016 net income due to factors described in the Results of Operations section of this Item 7 above and a smaller adjustment to net income for the non-cash (gain) loss on derivatives of $1.8 million.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P103_S0	Cash used in investing activities totaled $83.1 million in 2016, as compared to $138.7 million in 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P103_S1	The decrease is due to a decrease in cash paid to acquire mortgage revenue bonds of $58.0 million.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P104_S0	Cash provided by financing activities totaled $71.5 million in 2016, as compared to $87.2 million in 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P104_S1	Major factors that caused the decrease are a reduction in net borrowing on debt financing of $67.2 million, an increase of $9.6 million in principal payments on mortgages payable and an increase in distributions paid of $2.7 million.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P104_S2	These reductions are offset by $40.9 million in proceeds from issuances of Series A Preferred Units and a net increased on unsecured and secured lines of credit of $23.6 million.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P105_S0	We believe our cash balance and cash provided by the sources discussed herein will be sufficient to pay, or refinance, our debt obligations and to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P106_S0	We utilize a calculation of CAD as a metric to help us determine the Partnership s ability to make distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P106_S1	We believe that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P107_S0	To calculate CAD, we begin with net income and add back non-cash expenses consisting of amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond issuance costs, interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for loan losses, impairments on bonds and property loans, losses related to VIEs including depreciation expense, RUAs, and income received in cash from transactions which have been eliminated in consolidation, to the Partnership s net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP and deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 2 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements) attributable to the Partnership as defined in the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P108_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P109_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P109_S1	Although we consider CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities which are calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P110_S0	Currently cash distributions are made to the Partnership s Unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per unit.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P110_S1	The amount of the cash per unit distributed by us may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for this purpose.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P110_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated Cash Available for Distribution of $0.50 and $0.53 per unit, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P110_S3	We believe that as we continue to implement our current investment plans, we will be able to continue to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to Unitholders at the existing level of $0.50 per unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P110_S4	However, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate, which could result in a reduced annual distribution rate per unit.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P111_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of our net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to our CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P112_S0	(1) As described in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the Unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P112_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P113_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized contingent interest of approximately $642,000 from excess cash flow on the Ashley Square and Lake Forest mortgage revenue bonds and approximately $1.4 million on settlement of the Foundation for Affordable Housing property loan, which resulted in Tier 2 income allocable to the general partner of approximately $505,000.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P113_S1	In addition, we realized gross gains of approximately $12.4 million and $1.7 million from the sales of the Arboretum and Woodland Park, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P113_S2	After consideration of income taxes, the gain on these sales resulted in approximately $2.4 million allocable to the general partner.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P114_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Consolidated VIEs were sold and we realized approximately $4.8 million of contingent interest and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $1.2 million.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P114_S1	In addition, we reported the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial which resulted in an approximately $1.2 million and $3.4 million gain, respectively, and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner is approximately $297,000 and $854,000, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P115_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized the sale of the Autumn Pines bond which resulted in an approximate $873,000 gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $218,000, realized the redemption of the Lost Creek bond which resulted in an approximate $2.8 million gain and Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $709,000, and received contingent interest from Ashley Square generating $10,000 of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P116_S0	(2) The developer income amount represents cash received by us for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P116_S1	The development at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P116_S2	For purposes of CAD, we treat these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P117_S0	The table below identifies the composition of CAD p er unit earned by us for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:
1059142_17_ITEM7_P118_S0	The non-recurring CAD per unit reflects activity that will not recur within a two year period.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P119_S0	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held mortgage revenue bonds which are collateralized by Residential Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P120_S0	The Residential Properties are owned by entities that are not controlled by us.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P120_S1	We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P121_S0	The Consolidated VIEs did not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P121_S1	For additional discussions related to guarantees, see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P122_S0	We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P122_S1	As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P122_S2	We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in Note 24 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P123_S0	Contractual Obligations As discussed in Notes 15 through 18 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2017 consist of the principal paid on the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB, Term TOB and Term A/B credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P123_S1	Our strategic objective is to leverage our bond portfolio utilizing long term securitization financings either with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program or with Deutsche Bank through its Term A/B Trust program.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P123_S2	This strategy allows us to better match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to better manage the spread between our assets and liabilities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P124_S0	As part of our strategy of acquiring mortgage revenue bonds, we will enter into bond purchase commitments related to mortgage revenue bonds to be issued and secured by properties under construction.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P124_S1	Upon execution of the bond purchase commitment, the proceeds from the mortgage revenue bonds issued will be used to pay off the construction related debt and mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P125_S0	We account for our Bond Purchase Commitments as available-for-sale securities and record the estimated fair value of the Bond Purchase Commitments as an asset or liability with changes in such valuation recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P125_S1	See Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P125_S2	We have the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:
1059142_17_ITEM7_P126_S0	We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt obligations.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P126_S1	The weighted average interest of our lines of credit is 3.1% at December 31, 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P126_S2	The weighted average interest of our debt financing is 3.1% at December 31, 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P126_S3	The weighted average interest of our mortgages payable and other secured financings is 3.8% at December 31, 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P127_S0	Inflation With respect to the financial results of our investments in mortgage revenue bonds and MF Properties, substantially all of the resident leases at the Residential Properties, which collateralize our mortgage revenue bonds, allow for adjustments in the rent payable at the time of renewal, subject to rent restrictions related to mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P127_S1	Thus, the MF Properties may be able to seek rent increases.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P127_S2	The substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P127_S3	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P128_S0	Inflation did not have a significant impact on our financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P129_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make a number of judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P129_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by us.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P129_S2	All of our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 and 25 to the Company s consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P129_S3	We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies because they involve our judgments, assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P129_S4	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S0	Variable Interest Entities Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must evaluate entities in which it holds a variable interest to determine if the entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) and if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S1	The entity that is deemed to have (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S2	If the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then it must consolidate the VIEs in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S3	The Company has consolidated all VIEs in which it has determined it is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S4	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S5	The Partnership re-evaluates all VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P130_S6	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P131_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P131_S1	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership, the treatment of the mortgage revenue bonds on the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs as debt, the nature of the interest payments, which it believes to be tax-exempt, received on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Form K-1.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P132_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs was comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs since the applicable consolidation date.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P132_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as amended (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ).
1059142_17_ITEM7_P133_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P134_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P135_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P136_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P136_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_17_ITEM7_P137_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P138_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P139_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P140_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P140_S1	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Bond Purchase Commitments.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S1	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage bond purchase commitments have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S2	There is no active trading market for the mortgage revenue bonds and price quotes for the mortgage revenue bonds are not available.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S3	If available, the Partnership may also consider price quotes on similar mortgage revenue bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S4	The estimates of the fair values of these mortgage revenue bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P141_S5	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P142_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, the Partnership looks at the key inputs such as changes in the A rated municipal bond rates on similar mortgage revenue bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P142_S1	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P142_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P143_S0	The fair value of the bond purchase commitments is determined in the same manner as the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P144_S0	Investments in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S1	There is no active trading market for the trusts certificates owned by the Partnership, but it will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts, adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S3	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S4	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated mortgage revenue municipal bonds with terms of similar length.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P145_S5	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P146_S0	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in taxable bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P146_S1	There is no active trading market for the taxable bonds and price quotes are not available.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P147_S0	The estimates of the fair values of these taxable bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P147_S1	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P148_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in taxable bonds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P148_S1	The Partnership validates the changes in the estimated fair value of the taxable bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P148_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in taxable bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P149_S0	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate derivatives is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P149_S1	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate swaps is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P150_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs is not observable and therefore is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P150_S1	The inputs in the valuation model include three-month LIBOR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P151_S0	The Partnership calculates a fair value of each financial liability using a discounted cash flow model based on the debt amortization schedules at the effective rate of interest for each period represented.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P151_S1	This estimate of fair value is based on Level 3 inputs.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P152_S0	Mortgage Revenue Bond, Taxable Bonds and Bond Purchase Commitments Impairment The Partnership periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds and bond purchase commitments for impairment.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P152_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_17_ITEM7_P153_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P154_S0	While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, if the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the security prior to the time that their value recovers or until maturity, and whether the Partnership expects to recover the securities entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P154_S1	The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P155_S0	If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P156_S0	PHC Certificates Impairment The Partnership accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P156_S1	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P156_S2	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P156_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P157_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P157_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of a PHC Certificate below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_17_ITEM7_P158_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P159_S0	The Partnership reviews real estate assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P159_S1	When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P159_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM7_P160_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The nature of our mortgage revenue bonds, PHC Certificates and the debt financing used to finance these investments exposes us to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In addition, the mortgage revenue bonds may also pay contingent interest which fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our primary credit risk is the risk of default on our investment in mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans collateralized by the Residential Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P2_S1	The mortgage revenue bonds are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issued the bonds and are not guaranteed by such authorities, any insurer or other party.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P2_S2	In addition, the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated taxable property loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P2_S3	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the mortgage revenue bonds and the taxable property loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from any sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P3_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on our mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P4_S0	A property s ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of its operating expenses.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential properties in the market area in which a property is located.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S1	This is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S2	In addition, factors such as government regulation (e.g. zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S3	We also have credit risk in its investment in PHC Certificates, which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S4	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S5	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S6	Defaults on the mortgage revenue bonds, taxable property loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to Unitholders.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S7	In addition, if a property s net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P5_S8	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan secured by the property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P6_S0	In the event of a default on a mortgage revenue bond or taxable property loan, we will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P6_S1	If we take ownership of the property securing a defaulted mortgage revenue bond, we will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P6_S2	If such an event occurs, these amounts will not provide tax-exempt income.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P7_S0	We actively manage the credit risks associated with our mortgage revenue bonds and taxable property loans by performing a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these investments prior to investing.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P7_S1	In addition, we carefully monitor the performance of the properties underlying these investments subsequent to their purchase by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P8_S0	Our primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the rating report issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P9_S0	Mortgage Revenue Bonds and PHC Certificate Sensitivity Analysis We value our mortgage revenue bonds using discounted cash flow and yield to maturity analyses which encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P9_S1	The key assumption in our yield to maturity analysis is the range of effective yields of the individual mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P9_S2	The effective yield analysis for each mortgage revenue bond considers the current market yield on similar mortgage revenue bonds as well as the debt service coverage ratio of each underlying property serving as collateral for the mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P10_S0	adjusted l argely for unobservable inputs it believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P11_S0	Our fair value estimates encompass judgment and are compared to external pricing services when available.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P12_S0	We completed a sensitivity analysis which is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P12_S1	If available, we may also consider price quotes on similar mortgage revenue bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P12_S2	Pricing services, broker quotes and our analyses provide indicative pricing only.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P12_S3	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P12_S4	The table below summarizes the sensitivity analysis metrics related to the investments in the mortgage revenue bonds and PHC Certificates at December 31, 2016:
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P13_S0	The properties securing the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds are geographically dispersed throughout the United States with significant concentrations in California and Texas.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P13_S1	At December 31, 2016, and 2015, the concentration in California as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 20% and 8%, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P13_S2	At December 31, 2016, and 2015, the concentration in Texas as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 45% and 51%, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P13_S3	At December 31, 2016, and 2015, the concentration in South Carolina as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 12% and 12%, respectively.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P14_S0	Summary of Interest Rates on Borrowings and Interest Rate Cap Agreements At December 31, 2016, the total costs of borrowing by investment type were as follows:
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P15_S0	The mortgages payable and other secured financings range between 3.5% and 4.8%.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P16_S0	We manage our interest rate risk on our debt financing by entering into interest rate cap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate financing faci lities.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P16_S1	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership s interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2016:
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P17_S0	We have also contracted for two interest rate swaps with DB related to the Decatur Angle and Bruton Term A/B Financings securitized by mortgage revenue bonds for Decatur Angle and Bruton Apartments.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P17_S1	The following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2016 and 2015:
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P18_S0	These interest rate derivatives and interest rate swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and, accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings as interest expense.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P18_S1	See Note 25 for a description of the methodology and significant assumptions for determining the fair value of the interest rate derivatives and interest rate swap arrangements.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P19_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the impact on the Partnership s net interest income assuming a change in interest rates:
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P20_S0	Assumptions include anticipated interest rates, relationships between interest rate indices and outstanding investments, liabilit ies and interest rate derivative positions.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P20_S1	No assurance can be made that the assumptions included in the Table presented herein will occur or that other events would not occur that would affect the outcomes of the analysis.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P20_S2	Furthermore, the results included in the Table assume the Partnership does not act to change its sensitivity to the movement in interest rates.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P21_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2016, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_17_ITEM7A_P21_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our risk mitigating strategies at that time and the overall business and economic environment.

1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S5	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S6	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S7	Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S8	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S9	Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P0_S10	We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P1_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P1_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P2_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1059142_17_ITEM8_P9_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S0	Basis of Presentation America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. (the Company or Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds which have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing residential properties (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S2	Thus, most of the income earned by the Partnership is exempt from federal income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S3	The Partnership may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate and may make property loans secured by multifamily residential properties which may or may not be financed by mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S4	The Partnership may acquire real estate securing its mortgage revenue bonds or property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default or through the receipt of a fee simple deed in lieu of foreclosure.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S5	In addition, the Partnership may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties ( MF Properties ) in order to position itself for future investments in mortgage revenue bonds issued to finance these properties or to operate the MF Property until its highest and best use can be determined by management.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P10_S6	The Partnership expects to sell its interest in these MF Properties in connection with the future syndication of low income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code ( LIHTCs ) or to a tax-exempt organization and to acquire mortgage revenue bonds on these properties to provide debt financing to the new owners.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P11_S0	The general partner is America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or General Partner ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P11_S1	The general partner of AFCA 2 is Burlington Capital LLC ( Burlington ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P11_S2	The Partnership has issued Beneficial Unit Certificates ( BUCs ) representing assigned limited partner interests to investors ( Unitholders ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P11_S3	During 2016, the Partnership issued, in private placements, approximately 4.1 million units of non-cumulative, non-voting, non-convertible Series A Preferred Units ( Series A Preferred Units ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P11_S4	The Series A Preferred Units are redeemable in the future and represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership pursuant to a subscription agreement with four financial institutions resulting in approximately $40.9 million in gross aggregate proceeds to the Partnership (Note 21).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P12_S0	All disclosures of the number units for properties related to mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds and MF Properties are unaudited.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P13_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation The Partnership, as used herein, includes America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P13_S1	The wholly-owned subsidiaries include the MF Properties owned by various limited partnerships in which one of the wholly-owned subsidiaries ( The Greens Hold Co ) holds a 99% limited partner interest.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P13_S2	The wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Partnership consist of:
1059142_17_ITEM8_P14_S0	ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the TEBS Financing, M24 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 17).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P15_S0	ATAX TEBS II, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created in 2014 to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the second TEBS financing, M31 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 17).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P16_S0	ATAX TEBS III, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created in 2015 to hold mortgage revenue bonds in order to facilitate the third TEBS Financing, M33 TEBS Financing, with Freddie Mac (see Note 17).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P17_S0	ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership, committed to invest in the development of multifamily properties through property loans and equity contributions (see Notes 10 and 11).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P18_S0	Seven MF Properties which are either wholly or majority owned by the Partnership or subsidiaries of the Partnership (see Note 9).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P19_S0	Prior to January 1, 2016, the Partnership has consolidated two variable interest entities ( VIE ), Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks properties (the Consolidated VIEs ), in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P20_S0	the Consolidated VIEs but did own the mortgage revenue bonds that financed the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P20_S1	The Partnership was determined to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P20_S2	The Consolidated VIEs are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and all significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P21_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P21_S1	The Consolidated VIEs were sold in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S0	Variable Interest Entities Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must evaluate entities in which it holds a variable interest to determine if the entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) and if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S1	The entity that is deemed to have (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S2	If the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then it must consolidate the VIEs in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S3	The Company has consolidated all VIEs in which it has determined it is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S4	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S5	The Partnership re-evaluates all VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P22_S6	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P23_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P23_S1	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership, the treatment of the mortgage revenue bonds on the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs as debt, the nature of the interest payments, which it believes to be tax-exempt, received on the mortgage revenue bonds secured by the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Form K-1.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P24_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs was comprised of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs since the applicable consolidation date.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P24_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as amended (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Partnership sold its variable interests in Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks (the Consolidated VIEs) in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P24_S3	The sale of the Consolidated VIEs met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P24_S4	The gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs are reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented (see Notes 14).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P25_S0	Acquisition Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on acquisition accounting, the Partnership allocates the contractual purchase price of a property acquired to the land, building, improvements and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P25_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P26_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P26_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P27_S0	The acquisition related costs to acquire a property are expensed as incurred.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P28_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P28_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Partnership maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at two financial institutions.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P28_S2	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are equal to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P28_S3	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P29_S0	The Partnership does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P29_S1	This risk is minimized significantly by the Partnership s portfolio being r estricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P30_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash is legally restricted to use and is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P30_S1	In addition, the Partnership is required to maintain restricted cash balances related to the TEBS Financing facilities and the Partnership s interest rate derivatives.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P31_S0	The Partnership accounts for its investments in mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds and bond purchase commitments under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P31_S1	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P31_S2	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P31_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P31_S4	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value of mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds and bond purchase commitments.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P32_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each of its mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds and bond purchase commitments for impairment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P32_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered to be other-than-temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_17_ITEM8_P33_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P34_S0	While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, if the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the security prior to the time that the value recovers or until maturity, and whether the Partnership expects to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P34_S1	The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P35_S0	If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio which could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P35_S1	There were no impairment charges reported by the Partnership related to mortgage revenue bonds, taxable bonds or bond purchase commitments during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P36_S0	The Partnership owns some mortgage revenue bonds which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P36_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method over the term of the related mortgage revenue bond and is recognized as investment income in the current period.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Partnership eliminates the mortgage revenue bonds and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P37_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities The Partnership accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P37_S2	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P38_S0	characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P38_S1	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value for the PHC Certificates and MBS Securities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P38_S2	The Partnership sold its remaining MBS Securiti es in the first quarter of 2016.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P39_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each class of PHC Certificates and MBS Securities for impairment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P39_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of the investments is below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on a number of factors including:
1059142_17_ITEM8_P40_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P41_S0	There were no impairment charges reported by the Partnership related to the PHC Certificates and MBS Securities in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P42_S0	Real Estate Assets The Partnership s investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P42_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19-40 years on multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P42_S2	Depreciation expenses is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P42_S3	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P42_S4	The Partnership also holds land held for investment and development which is reported at cost.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Partnership recognizes gain and losses equal to the difference between proceeds on sale and the net carrying value of the assets at the date of disposition.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Partnership reviews real estate assets at least quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P43_S2	When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P43_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P43_S4	See Note 9 for information on recognized impairment charges.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Entities The Partnership makes initial investments in and is committed to invest, through ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, in certain limited liability companies ( Vantage Properties ).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S1	ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC holds a limited membership interest in the Vantage Properties.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S2	The investments will be used to construct multifamily properties.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S3	The Partnership does not have a controlling interest in the Vantage Properties and accounts for its limited partnership interest under the equity method of accounting.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S4	The Partnership earns a return on its investment accruing immediately on its contributed capital which is guaranteed during the construction phase of the multifamily properties by an unrelated third party.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S5	Due to the guarantee provided during the construction phase, cash flows are expected to be sufficient to make the payments.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P44_S6	As a result, the Partnership records the return on the investment earned by the Partnership as investment income in the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations (Note 10).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P45_S0	The Partnership reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P45_S1	Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary includes, but is not limited to, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P45_S2	The Partnership s assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P45_S3	If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an appropriate write-down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P46_S0	In addition to the mortgage revenue bonds held by the Partnership, taxable property loans have been made to the owners of some of the properties which secure mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P46_S1	The Partnership recognizes interest income on the property loans as earned.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P46_S2	Interest income is not recognized for property loans that are deemed to be in nonaccrual status.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P46_S3	The repayment of these taxable property loans is dependent largely on the value of the property or its cash flows which collateralize the loans.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P46_S4	The Partnership periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property which collateralizes the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding mortgage revenue bonds plus any taxable property loans.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P47_S0	The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model ( DCF ) that considers a number of different DCF models that contain varying assumptions.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P47_S1	The various models may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P47_S2	The Partnership may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P47_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property after deducting the amortized cost basis of the senior mortgage revenue bond exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P47_S4	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P48_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P48_S1	See Note 11 for additional information on the Partnership s loan loss allowances.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P49_S0	Assets Held for Sale The Partnership reports assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet in the period that the Partnership has committed to a plan to dispose of an asset or asset group, the asset or asset group is being marketed for sale, and it is probable the sale will be completed within one year.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P49_S1	Once an asset or asset group is determined to be held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciation of the asset or asset group.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P49_S2	The Partnership has evaluated the accounting guidance in regard to the TOB, Term TOB, Term A/B and TEBS Financings (Note 17) and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P49_S3	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P49_S4	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through any of the following:
1059142_17_ITEM8_P50_S0	An agreement that permits the transferee to require the transferor to repurchase the transferred financial assets at a price that is so favorable to the transferee that it is probable that the transferee will require the transferor to repurchase them.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Partnership to control the assets within the various securitization trusts.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P51_S1	See Note 17 for additional terms on the Partnership s secured financing arrangements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P51_S2	Based on these terms, the Partnership has concluded that the condition in item 2 above is present and, therefore, effective control over the transferred assets has not occurred.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P52_S0	As effective control has not been transferred, the transaction does not meet the conditions to de-recognize the assets.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P53_S0	In addition to evaluating the above securitization transactions as sales or transfers of financial assets, the Partnership has evaluated the securitization trusts associated with the TOB, Term TOB, Term A/B and TEBS Financings in accordance with guidance on consolidation of VIEs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P53_S1	See Note 5 for the consolidation analysis related to these secured financing arrangements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P53_S2	The Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts and consolidates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the securitization trusts in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P54_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P54_S1	Debt financing costs associated with revolving line of credit arrangements are reported within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P54_S2	Debt financing costs for other debts are reported as reductions to the carrying value of the related debts on the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P55_S0	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P55_S1	Bond issuance costs are reported as an adjustment to the carrying cost of the related mortgage revenue bond on the consolidated balance sheet.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S0	No provision has been made for income taxes because the Unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership s taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes, except for certain entities described below.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and The Greens Hold Co are corporations subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Partnership will recognize income tax expense or benefit for the federal and state income taxes incurred by these entities on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S3	The Partnership evaluates its tax positions taken in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S4	As such, the Partnership may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Partnership believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P56_S5	The Partnership accrues interest and penalties as incurred within income tax expense.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P57_S0	Deferred income tax expense, or benefit, is generally a function of the period s temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes) and the utilization of tax net operating losses ( NOL ) generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P57_S1	The Partnership provides for a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if it believes all, or some portion, of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P57_S2	Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred tax expense (Note 12).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P58_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its mortgage revenue bonds is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P58_S1	Base interest income on fully performing mortgage revenue bonds is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P58_S2	Base interest income on mortgage revenue bonds not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P58_S3	Past due base interest on mortgage revenue bonds previously not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P58_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the mortgage revenue bond s ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P59_S0	Certain mortgage revenue bonds contain contingent interest provisions that generate excess available cash flow.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P60_S0	Contingent interest income is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P60_S1	Past due contingent interest on mortgage revenue bonds, which are or were previously not fully performing, is recognized when realized or realizable.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P60_S2	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Partnership s mortgage revenue bonds were fully performing as to their base interest.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P61_S0	Revenue Recognition on Investments in Real Estate, MBS, and PHC Certificates The Partnership s Consolidated VIEs and the MF Properties are lessors of multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen rental units under leases with terms of one year or less.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P61_S1	Rental revenue is recognized, net of rental concessions, on a straight-line method over the related lease term.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P61_S2	Interest income on the MBS and PHC Certificates is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Partnership reports all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets at fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P62_S1	The Partnership s derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Partnership is exposed to loss should a counterparty to its derivative instruments default.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P62_S3	The Partnership does not anticipate non-performance by any counterparty.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P62_S4	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value for the derivative instruments.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P63_S0	Redeemable Series A Preferred Units The Partnership has issued Series A Preferred Units to various financial institutions., which represent limited partnership interests in the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P63_S1	In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Partnership, the holders of the Series A Preferred Units are entitled to a liquidation preference in connection with their investments.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P64_S0	the Partnership s BUCs and to any other class or series of Partnership interests or securities expressly designated a s ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Units , and junior to any other class or series of Partnership interests or securities expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Units .
1059142_17_ITEM8_P64_S1	The Series A Preferred Units have no stated maturity, are not subject to any sinking fund requirements, and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless repurchased or redeemed by the Partnership or holder.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P64_S2	Upon the sixth anniversary of the closing of the sale of Series A Preferred Units to a subscriber, and upon each anniversary thereafter, the Partnership and each holder of Series A Preferred Units will have the right to redeem, in whole or in part, the Series A Preferred Units held by such holder at a per unit redemption price equal to $10.00 per unit plus an amount equal to all declared and unpaid distributions.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P64_S3	The Series A Preferred Units are recorded as mezzanine equity due to the holders redemption option which, if and when the units become subject to redemption, is outside the Partnership s control.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P64_S4	In addition, the costs of issuing the Series A Preferred Units are netted against the carrying value and amortized to the first redemption date (Note 21).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S0	The Partnership s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan ), as approved by the Unitholders in September 2015, permits the grant of restricted units and other awards to the employees of Burlington, the Partnership, or any affiliate of either, and members of Burlington s Board of Managers for up to 3.0 million BUCs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S1	Restricted unit awards are generally granted with vesting conditions ranging from three months to up to three years.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S2	RUAs currently provide for the payment of distributions during the restriction period.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S3	The RUAs provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S4	The fair value of each RUA is estimated on the grant date based on the Partnership s exchange-listed closing price of the BUCs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S5	The Partnership recognizes compensation expense for the RUAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period (Note 23).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P65_S6	Net Income per BUC The Partnership has disclosed basic and diluted net income per BUC on the consolidated statements of operations.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P66_S0	The unvested RUAs issued under the Plan are considered participating securities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P67_S0	The Partnership used the two-class method to allocate net income available to BUCs and the unvested restricted units.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P67_S1	Unvested restricted unit awards are included with BUCs for the calculation of diluted net income per BUC using the treasury stock method.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S0	The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Partnership to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuations, investment impairments, impairment of property assets, allocation of the purchase price for acquisition accounting and allowance for loan losses.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S3	Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S4	In 2016, the Partnership began to classify its amortization of deferred financing costs as a separate line within the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S5	Previously this amount had been classified within depreciation and amortization.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S6	Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Partnership has reclassified the amortization of deferred financing costs and has included them in conformity for the periods presented herein.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S7	This reclassification has no effect on the Partnership s reported net income or partners capital in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S8	In 2016, the Partnership began to classify its property loans, net of loan losses, as a separate line item within the Partnership s consolidated balance sheets.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S9	Previously this amount had been classified within other assets.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S10	Accordingly, the Partnership has reclassified the property loans, net of loan loss reserves, for the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 and has included them in conformity for the periods presented herein.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P68_S11	This reclassification has no effect on the Partnership s reported net income or partners capital in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for the periods presented .
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S0	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2017-01, Business Combinations; Clarifying the Definition of a Business.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S1	The ASU modifies the requirements to meet the definition of a business under Topic 805, Business Combinations.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S2	The amendments provide a screen to determine when a set of identifiable assets and liabilities is not a business.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S3	The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S4	The impact is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S5	The ASU is effective for the Partnership for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and is applied prospectively.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P69_S6	The Partnership has not elected early adoption at December 31, 2016 and is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P70_S0	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows; Restricted Cash.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P70_S1	The ASU requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P70_S2	Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P71_S0	The ASU is effective for the Partnership s annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is applied retrospectively.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P71_S1	The Partnership has not elected early adoption at December 31, 2016 and does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P72_S0	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P72_S1	The ASU clarifies the presentation of cash receipts and cash payments related to certain transaction.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P72_S2	The ASU is effective for the Partnership for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and is applied retrospectively.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P72_S3	The Partnership has not elected early adoption at December 31, 2016 and is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P73_S0	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326).
1059142_17_ITEM8_P73_S1	The ASU enhances the methodology of measuring expected credit losses to include the use of forward-looking information to better inform credit loss estimates.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P73_S2	The ASU is effective for the Partnership s annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and is applied under a modified-retrospective approach.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P73_S3	The Partnership is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P74_S0	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

1059142_17_ITEM8_P179_S7	The new accounting guidance changed the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements to present them as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than classified as Other Assets, applied retrospectively.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P179_S8	This new ASU did not change the presentation of debt issuance costs related to revolving LOCs as these continue to be reported as Other Assets.

1059142_17_ITEM8_P208_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P209_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P210_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P211_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P211_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_17_ITEM8_P212_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P213_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P214_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P215_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P215_S1	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds and Bond Purchase Commitments.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S1	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage bond purchase commitments have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S2	There is no active trading market for the mortgage revenue bonds and price quotes for the mortgage revenue bonds are not available.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S3	If available, the Partnership may also consider price quotes on similar mortgage revenue bonds or other information from external sources, such as pricing services.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S4	The estimates of the fair values of these mortgage revenue bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P216_S5	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P217_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in mortgage revenue bonds between reporting periods, the Partnership looks at the key inputs such as changes in the A rated municipal bond rates on similar mortgage revenue bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P217_S1	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P217_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in mortgage revenue bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P217_S3	At December 31, 2016, the range of effective yields on the individual mortgage revenue bonds was 4.9% to 12.4% per annum.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P217_S4	At December 31, 2015, the range of effective yields on the individual mortgage revenue bonds was 4.2% to 12.1% per annum.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P218_S0	The fair value of the bond purchase commitments is determined in the same manner as the mortgage revenue bonds.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates has been based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S1	There is no active trading market for the trusts certificates owned by the Partnership, but it will look at estimated values as determined by pricing services when available.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S2	The estimates of the fair values of these trusts certificates begin with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts, adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S3	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by external pricing services and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S4	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of PHC Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated mortgage revenue municipal bonds with terms of similar length.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P219_S5	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P220_S0	At December 31, 2016, the range of effective yields on the PHC Certificates was 4.3% to 6.0% per annum.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P220_S1	At December 31, 2015, the range of effective yields on the PHC Certificates was 3.9% to 5.7% per annum.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P221_S0	At December 31, 2015, the fair value of the Partnership s investment in MBS Securities was based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P221_S1	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods, incorporates trading activity observed in the marketplace, and other data inputs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P221_S2	The methodology also considered the underlying characteristics of each security, which were also observable inputs, including: coupon; maturity date; loan age; reset date; collateral type; geography; and prepayment speeds.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P222_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third-party pricing service by comparing it to valuation information obtained from at least one other third party pricing service, ensuring they were within a tolerable range of difference which the Partnership estimates as 7.5%.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P222_S1	The Partnership also looked at observations of trading activity in the marketplace when available.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P222_S2	Given these facts, the fair value measurements of the Partnership s investment in MBS Securities were categorized as Level 2 inputs.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P223_S0	The fair values of the Partnership s investments in taxable bonds have each been based on a discounted cash flow or yield to maturity analysis.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P223_S1	There is no active trading market for the taxable bonds and price quotes are not available.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P224_S0	The estimates of the fair values of these taxable bonds, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P225_S0	methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P226_S0	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in taxable bon ds between reporting periods, management looks at the key inputs such as changes in the current market yields on similar bonds as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each bond.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P226_S1	The Partnership validates the changes in the estimated fair value of the taxable bonds move with the changes in these monitored factors.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P226_S2	Given these facts the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in taxable bonds is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P227_S0	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate derivatives is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P227_S1	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate swaps is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P228_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs is not observable and therefore is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_17_ITEM8_P228_S1	The inputs in the valuation model include three-month LIBOR rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms.

1059142_17_ITEM15_P250_S0	The information contained in the Report fairly presents, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of operations of the Partnership.
1059142_17_ITEM15_P251_S0	A signed original of this written statement required by Section 906 has been provided to America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and will be retained by America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission or its staff upon request.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P0_S0	The Partnership has been in operation since 1998 and owns 87 MRBs with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $719.8 million as of December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S0	The majority of these MRBs were issued by various state and local housing authorities in order to provide construction and/or permanent financing for 63 Residential Properties containing a total of 10,666 rental units located in 14 states in the United States.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S1	Each MRB for the Residential Properties is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S2	One MRB is secured by a mortgage on the ground, facilities, and equipment of a commercial ancillary health care facility in Tennessee.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S3	Each of the MRBs provides for base interest payable at a fixed rate on a periodic basis.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S4	Additionally, the MRBs may also provide for the payment of contingent interest determined by the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying real estate properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S5	Such MRBs provide us with the potential to participate in future increases in the cash flow generated by the financed properties, either through operations, from the refinancing of the MRB or from their ultimate sale.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S6	Of the MRBs owned, 20 are owned directly by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S7	Nine of the MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS I, LLC, 12 MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS II, LLC, and 8 MRBs are owned by ATAX TEBS III, LLC.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S8	Two MRBs are securitized and held by Deutsche Bank AG ( DB ) in Term Tender Option Bond ( Term TOB ) facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S9	Thirty-six MRBs are securitized and held by DB in Term A/B Trust financing facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P1_S10	See Notes 2 and 17 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P2_S0	The ability of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize our MRBs to make payments of base and contingent interest is a function of the net cash flow generated by these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P3_S0	Net cash flow from a multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P4_S0	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, apartments in the market areas in which a property is located.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P4_S1	This, in turn, is affected by several factors such as the requirement that a certain percentage of the rental units be set aside for tenants who qualify as persons of low to moderate income, local or national economic conditions, and the amount of new apartment construction and interest rates on single-family mortgage loans.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P5_S0	Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients which utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P5_S1	In addition, factors such as government regulation, inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of the properties which collateralize the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S0	The return we realize from our investments in MRBs depends upon the economic performance of the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize these MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S1	We may be considered to be in competition with other residential rental properties and commercial properties located in the same geographic areas as the properties financed with our MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S2	We may also make taxable property loans secured by the Residential Properties which are financed by MRBs held by us.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S3	We do this to provide financing for capital improvements at these properties or to otherwise support property operations when we determine it is in our best long-term interest.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S4	We may also invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate to the extent allowed by ATAX s First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as further amended (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ) and the conditions to the exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that are relied upon by us.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S5	Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, any tax-exempt investments, other than MRBs, that are not secured by a direct or indirect interest in a property must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P6_S6	The Partnership s acquisition of any tax-exempt investment or other investment may not cause the aggregate book value of such investments to exceed 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P7_S0	At December 31, 2017, we had one class of other tax-exempt investments, the Public Housing Capital Fund Trusts Certificates ( PHC Certificates ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P7_S1	The PHC Certificates had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of approximately $50.4 million at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P8_S0	The PHC Certificates are securitized into three separate TOB financing facilities ( TOB Trusts ) with DB ( PHC Trusts ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P8_S1	See Note 17 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P9_S0	The PHC Certificates held by the PHC Trusts consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P9_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to the public housing authorities by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) under HUD s Capital Fund Program established under the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (the Capital Fund Program ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P9_S2	The PHC Trusts have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P10_S0	At December 31, 2017, we own limited membership interests in certain unconsolidated entities ( Vantage Properties ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P10_S1	Our investments in the Vantage Properties are used to construct multifamily real estate properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P10_S2	We do not have controlling interests in the Vantage Properties and account for the limited partnership interests under the equity method of accounting.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P11_S0	The Partnership earns a return on its investments accruing immediately on its contributed capital, which is guaranteed during the construction phase by an unrelated third party.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P12_S0	The limited membership interests entitle the Partnership to shares of certain cash flows generated by the Vantage Properties from operations or upon the occurrence of certain capital transactions, such as a sale or refinancing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S0	We may acquire interests in multifamily, student, and senior citizen apartment properties ( MF Properties ) to position ourselves for future investments in MRBs issued to finance these properties and which we expect and believe will generate tax-exempt interest.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S1	We currently hold interests in three MF Properties containing 1,013 rental units located in Nebraska, California, and Florida.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S2	In addition, we may acquire real estate securing our MRBs or taxable property loans through foreclosure in the event of a default.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S3	To restructure each of the MF Properties into a MRB, we team with a third-party developer who works to secure a MRB issuance from the local housing authority.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S4	Once the developer receives the MRB commitment, we will sell the MF Property to a not-for-profit entity, public finance authority or to a for profit entity in connection with a syndication of LIHTCs under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Internal Revenue Code ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S5	We expect to acquire the MRBs issued to provide debt financing for these properties at the time the property ownership is restructured.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S6	Such restructurings will generally be expected to occur within 36 months of our initial investment in an MF Property and will often coincide with the expiration of the compliance period relating to LIHTCs previously issued with respect to the MF Property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S7	We will not acquire LIHTCs in connection with these transactions.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S8	In the event that the MF Property cannot secure a MRB, we will operate the MF Property until the opportunity arises to sell it at what we believe is its optimal fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S9	These types of transactions represent a long-term market opportunity for us and will provide us with a pipeline of future MRB investment opportunities.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S10	At December 31, 2017, we have four reportable segments: (1) Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments, (2) MF Properties, (3) Public Housing Capital Fund Trust, and (4) Other Investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S11	In addition to the reportable segments, the Partnership also separately reports its consolidation and elimination information because it does not allocate certain items to the segments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P13_S12	See Note 26 to the Company consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S0	At December 31, 2017, eight of the 63 Residential Properties which collateralize the MRBs owned by us are managed by Burlington Capital Properties, LLC ( Properties Management ), an affiliate of the Partnership s general partner, America First Capital Associates Limited Partnership Two ( AFCA 2 or the General Partner ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S1	In this regard, Properties Management provides property management services for Lake Forest Apartments, Cross Creek, Greens of Pine Glen (the Greens Property ), Crescent Village, Willow Bend and Post Woods (collectively, the Ohio Properties ), Rosewood Townhomes and South Point Apartments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S2	Property Management also provides management services to each of the MF Properties, except for the Suites on Paseo.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S3	Management believes that this relationship provides greater insight and understanding of the underlying property operations and their ability to meet debt service requirements to us and helps assure these properties are being operated in compliance with operating restrictions imposed by the terms of the applicable bond financing and/or LIHTC.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S4	Our business objectives are to (i) preserve and protect our capital, (ii) provide regular cash distributions to our Unitholders which we believe are substantially exempt from federal income tax, and (iii) generate additional returns from appreciation of real estate or the opportunistic sale of the asset investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S5	We have sought to meet these objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of MRBs that were issued to finance, and are secured by mortgages on, multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S6	Certain of these bonds may be structured to provide a potential for an enhanced yield through the payment of contingent interest which is payable out of net cash flow from operations and the realization of net capital appreciation of the financed multifamily residential properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S7	We expect and believe that any contingent interest we receive will be exempt from inclusion in gross income for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S8	We are pursuing a business strategy of acquiring additional MRBs and other investments on a leveraged basis to (i) increase the amount of interest available for distribution to our Unitholders; (ii) reduce risk through asset diversification and interest rate hedging; and (iii) achieve economies of scale.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S9	We are pursuing this growth strategy by investing in additional MRBs and other investments as permitted by the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, taking advantage of attractive financing structures available in the securities market, and entering into interest rate risk management instruments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S10	We may finance the acquisition of additional MRBs and other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, the issuance of additional Units, lines of credit, or securitization financing using our existing portfolio of MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P14_S11	Our current operating policy is to use securitizations or other forms of leverage which will not exceed 75% of the total Partnership assets.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P15_S0	The assets are defined as the carrying value of the MRBs, PHC Certificates, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P15_S1	See the discussion of financing arrangements and liquidity and capital resources in Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S0	We continually assess opportunities to reposition our existing portfolio of MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S1	The principal objective of this assessment is to improve the quality and performance of our MRB portfolio and, ultimately, increase the amount of cash available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S2	In some cases, we may elect to redeem selected MRBs that have experienced significant appreciation.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S3	Through the selective redemption of the MRBs, a sale or refinancing of the underlying property will be required.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S4	If sufficient sale or refinancing proceeds exist, we may be entitled to receive payment of contingent interest on our investment.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S5	In other cases, we may elect to sell MRBs on properties that are in stagnant or declining markets.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S6	The proceeds received from these transactions would be redeployed into other investments consistent with our investment objectives.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S7	We expect to invest primarily in MRBs issued to provide affordable rental housing, student housing projects, housing for senior citizens, and commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P16_S8	The four basic types of MRBs which we may acquire as investments are as follows:
1059142_18_ITEM1_P17_S0	Each of these structures permit the issuance of MRBs to finance the construction or acquisition and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing or other not-for-profit commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P17_S1	Under applicable Treasury Regulations, any affordable multifamily residential project financed with MRBs that are purportedly tax-exempt must set aside a percentage of its total rental units for occupancy by tenants whose incomes do not exceed stated percentages of the median income in the local area.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P17_S2	In each case, the balance of the rental units in the multifamily residential project may be rented at market rates (unless otherwise restricted by local housing authorities).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S0	With respect to private activity bonds issued under Section 142(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, the owner of the multifamily residential project may elect, at the time the MRBs are issued, whether to set aside a minimum of 20% of the units for tenants making less than 50% of area median income (as adjusted for household size) or 40% of the units for tenants making less than 60% of the area median income (as adjusted for household size).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S1	The MRBs that were secured by Residential Properties issued prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (so called 80/20 bonds) require that 20% of the rental units be set aside for tenants whose income does not exceed 80% of the area median income, without adjustment for household size.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S2	There are no Treasury Regulations related to the MRBs which are collateralized by the commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S3	We expect that many of the private activity housing MRBs that we evaluate for acquisition will be issued in conjunction with the syndication of LIHTCs by the owner of the financed multifamily residential project.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S4	Additionally, to facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional MRBs secured by MF Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in the MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S5	We expect to acquire MRBs on these MF Properties in many cases at the time of a restructuring of the MF Property ownership.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P18_S6	Such restructuring may involve the syndication of LIHTCs in conjunction with property rehabilitation.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P19_S0	Investment Types Mortgage Revenue Bonds .
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S0	We invest in MRBs that are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S1	Each of these bonds bears interest at a fixed annual base rate.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S2	One of the MRBs currently owned by us also provides for the payment of contingent interest, which is payable out of the net cash flow and net capital appreciation of the underlying multifamily residential property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S3	The amount of interest earned by us from our investment in MRBs is a function of the net cash flow generated by the Residential Properties and the commercial property which collateralize the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S4	Net cash flow from a residential property depends on the rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of operating expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P20_S5	Net cash flow from the commercial property depends on the number of cancer patients that utilize the cancer therapy center and the ability to hire and retain key employees to provide the related cancer treatment.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P21_S0	We may invest in other types of securities that may or may not be secured by real estate.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P21_S1	Other tax-exempt investments must be rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P21_S2	These tax-exempt investments and other securities may not represent more than 25% of our assets at the time of acquisition.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P22_S0	The PHC Certificates consist of custodial receipts evidencing loans made to numerous public housing authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P22_S1	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P22_S2	The PHC Certificates have a first lien on these annual Capital Fund Program payments to secure the public housing authorities respective obligations to pay principal and interest on their loans.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P22_S3	The PHC Certificates rating by Standard Poor s is investment grade at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P23_S0	We also have a reportable segment consisting of ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, which, at December 31, 2017, is invested in the Vantage Properties, and has issued property loans due from Vantage at Brooks LLC and Vantage at New Braunfels LLC.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P23_S1	We may also make taxable property loans secured by Residential Properties which are financed by MRBs that are held by us.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P23_S2	As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire direct or indirect interests in MF Properties to position ourselves for a future investment in MRBs issued to finance the acquisition or substantial rehabilitation of such MF Properties by a new owner.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P24_S0	Investment Opportunities and Business Challenges There continues to be a significant unmet demand for affordable multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential housing in the United States.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P24_S1	HUD reports that there is a high demand for quality affordable housing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P24_S2	The types of MRBs in which we invest offer developers of affordable housing a low-cost source of construction and permanent debt financing for these types of properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P24_S3	Investors purchase these MRBs because the interest income paid on these bonds is expected to be exempt from federal income taxation.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P25_S0	The demand for affordable housing by qualified potential residents whose income does not exceed 50-60% of the area median income continues to increase.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P25_S1	Government programs that provide direct rental support to residents has not kept up with the demand, therefore programs that support private sector development and support for affordable housing through MRBs, tax credits and grant funding to developers have become more prominent.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P25_S2	In addition to MRBs, the federal government promotes affordable housing using LIHTCs for affordable multifamily rental housing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P25_S3	The syndication and sale of LIHTCs along with MRB financing is attractive to developers of affordable housing because it helps them raise equity and debt financing for their projects.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P25_S4	Under this program, developers that receive an allocation of private activity bonds will also receive an allocation of federal LIHTCs as a method to encourage the development of affordable multifamily housing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P26_S0	We do not invest in LIHTCs, but are attracted to MRBs that are issued in association with federal LIHTC syndications because in order to be eligible for federal LIHTCs a property must either be newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated and therefore, may be less likely to become functionally obsolete in the near term than an older property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P27_S0	There are various requirements to be eligible for federal LIHTCs, including rent and tenant income restrictions.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P27_S1	In general, the property owner must elect to set aside either 40% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by households whose income is 60% or less (adjusted for family size) of the area median gross income or 20% or more of the property s residential units for occupancy by households whose income is 50% or less (adjusted for family size) of the area median gross income.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P27_S2	These units remain subject to these set aside requirements for a minimum of 30 years.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P28_S0	The inability to access debt financing may result in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P28_S1	There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions of MRBs or other investments through either additional equity or debt financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P28_S2	Although the consequences of market and economic conditions and their impact on our ability to pursue our plan to grow through investments in additional housing bonds are not fully known, we do not anticipate that our existing assets will be adversely affected in the long-term.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P28_S3	In addition, the Residential Properties and MF Properties which have not reached stabilization (which is 90% occupancy for 90 days and the achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service during the period) will result in lower economic occupancy at the related properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P29_S0	The Partnership may finance the acquisition of additional MRBs or other investments through the reinvestment of cash flow, use of available lines of credit, with debt financing collateralized by our existing portfolio of MRBs or other investments (including the securitization of these bonds), issuance of Preferred Units or the issuance of additional Beneficial Unit Certificates ( BUCs ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P30_S0	We utilize leverage to enhance investor rates of return.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P30_S1	We use target constraints for each type of financing utilized by us to manage an overall 75% leverage constraint.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P30_S2	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the tenor of the leverage program, whether the financing is subject to market collateral calls, and the liquidity and marketability of the financing collateral.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P30_S3	While short term variations from targeted levels may occur within financing classes, overall Partnership leverage will not exceed 75%.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P31_S0	Our overall leverage ratio is calculated as total outstanding debt divided by total partnership assets using the carrying value of the MRBs, PHC Certificates, initial finance costs, and the MF Properties at cost.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P31_S1	At December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was approximately 64%.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S0	We may, from time to time, issue additional BUCs in the public market.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S1	In November 2016, a Registration Statement on Form S-3 ( Registration Statement ) was declared effective by the SEC under which the Partnership may offer up to $225.0 million of additional BUCs from time to time.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S2	The Registration Statement will expire in November 2019.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S3	In December 2017, the Partnership initiated an at the market offering to sell up to $75.0 million of BUCs at market prevailing on the date of sale.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S4	The $75 million available under the at the market program represents a portion of the $225 million Registration Statement.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P32_S5	The Partnership sold 161,383 BUCs under the program for net proceeds of approximately $806,000, net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P33_S0	Under the Amended and Restated LP Agreement, we are authorized to issue partnership securities, including preferred units of limited partnership interests, containing certain designations, preferences, rights, powers, and duties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P33_S1	In this regard, we previously authorized the issuance of up to $100 million of Series A Preferred Units pursuant to a private placement, and this offering was terminated as of October 25, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P33_S2	Under this authorization, the Partnership issued approximately 9.5 million Series A Preferred Units to five financial institutions resulting in approximately $94.5 million in gross proceeds.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P33_S3	The Partnership used the proceeds received to acquire MRBs that are issued by state and local housing authorities to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily, student housing, and commercial properties that are likely to receive consideration as qualified investments under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 ( CRA ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P34_S0	Recent Developments The following table presents information regarding the investment activity of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:
1059142_18_ITEM1_P35_S0	See Cash Available for Distribution in Item 7.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P36_S0	The following table presents information regarding the debt financing, derivative and Series A Preferred Units activity of the Partnership for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, exclusive of retired debt amounts listed in the investment activity table above:
1059142_18_ITEM1_P37_S0	See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P38_S0	Management and Employees We are managed by our General Partner which is controlled by its general partner, Burlington Capital LLC ( Burlington ).
1059142_18_ITEM1_P38_S1	The Board of Managers and certain employees of Burlington act as the managers (and effectively as the directors) and executive officers of the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P38_S2	Certain services are provided to us by employees of Burlington and we reimburse Burlington for its allocated share of these salaries and benefits.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P38_S3	At December 31, 2017, the Partnership had no employees.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P39_S0	Competition We compete with private investors, lending institutions, trust funds, investment partnerships, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ) and other entities with objectives similar to ours for the acquisition of MRBs and other investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P39_S1	This competition could reduce the availability of investments to the Partnership for acquisition and reduce the interest rate that issuers pay on these investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S0	Because we hold MRBs secured by Residential Properties, a commercial property, and hold interests in the MF Properties, we may be in competition with other real estate in the same geographic areas.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S1	In each city in which the properties financed by the MRBs owned by us or MF Properties are located, such properties compete with a substantial number of other multifamily rental properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S2	Multifamily rental properties also compete with single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S3	To compete effectively, the multifamily, student, and senior citizen residential properties financed or owned by us must offer quality apartments at competitive rental rates.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S4	To maintain occupancy rates and attract quality tenants, the Residential Properties and MF Properties may also offer rental concessions, such as free rent to new tenants for a stated period.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P40_S5	These Residential Properties and MF Properties also compete by offering quality apartments in attractive locations and that provide tenants with amenities such as recreational facilities, garages and pleasant landscaping.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P41_S0	We believe each of the MF Properties, the Residential Properties, and the commercial property comply, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P41_S1	We are not aware of any environmental contamination at any of these properties that would require any material capital expenditure by the underlying properties, and therefore the Partnership, for the remediation thereof.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P42_S0	We are classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and accordingly, there is no provision for income taxes.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P42_S1	The distributive share of our income, deductions and credits is included in each Unitholder s income tax return.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P42_S2	We hold interests in MF Properties, except for the Suites on Paseo and Jade Park, through a wholly-owned subsidiary that is a C corporation for income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P42_S3	The subsidiary files separate federal and state income tax returns and its income is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P43_S0	We consolidate separate legal entities who record, and report income taxes based upon their individual legal structure which may include corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P43_S1	The Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks Consolidated VIEs results of operations were reported as discontinued operations for all periods as presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for reporting purposes and are separate legal entities for all years presented.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P44_S0	Form K-1, our ability to distribute income to Unitholders which we believe is tax-exempt, the current level of quarterly distributions, or the tax-exempt status of the underlying MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P45_S0	All financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on the basis of Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America, with the exception of the Non-GAAP measure disclosed in Item 7.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P46_S0	The Partnership is a Delaware limited partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P46_S1	Our general partner is AFCA 2, whose general partner is Burlington.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P47_S0	Since 1984, Burlington has specialized in the management of investment funds, many of which were formed to acquire real estate investments such as MRBs, mortgage-backed securities, and real estate properties, including multifamily, student and senior citizen housing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P48_S0	Burlington maintains its principal executive offices at 1004 Farnam Street, Suite 400, Omaha, Nebraska 68102, and its telephone number is (402) 444-1630.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S0	The Partnership does not have any employees of its own.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S1	Employees of Burlington, acting through AFCA 2 (our General Partner), are responsible for our operations and we reimburse Burlington for the allocated salaries and benefits of these employees and for other expenses incurred in running our business operations.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S2	AFCA 2 is entitled to an administrative fee equal to 0.45% per annum of the outstanding principal balance of any MRBs, tax-exempt investments or other investments for which an unaffiliated party is not obligated to pay.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S3	When the administrative fee is payable by a property owner, it is subordinated to the payment of all base interest to the Partnership on the MRB on that property.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S4	Our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that the administrative fee will be paid directly by us with respect to any investments for which the administrative fee is not payable by the property owner or a third party.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S5	In addition, our Amended and Restated LP Agreement provides that we will pay the administrative fee to the General Partner with respect to any foreclosed MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S6	AFCA 2 may also earn mortgage placement fees resulting from the identification and evaluation of additional investments that we acquire.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S7	In addition, an affiliate of AFCA 2, Farnam Capital Advisors, LLC ( FCA ), acts as an origination advisor and consultant to the borrowers when MRBs, other investments and financing facilities are acquired by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S8	Any such fees will be paid by the owners of the properties financed by the acquired MRBs or other investments out of their proceeds.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S9	Any fees related to the origination of financing facilities are paid by the Trustee out of the gross proceeds of the financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P49_S10	The fees, if any, will be subject to negotiation between AFCA 2, its affiliate, and such property owners.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P50_S0	Properties Management is an affiliate of Burlington that is engaged in the management of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P50_S1	Properties Management earns a fee paid out of property revenues.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P50_S2	Properties Management may also seek to become the manager of multifamily, student and senior citizen residential properties financed by additional MRBs acquired by the Partnership, subject to negotiation with the owners of such properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P50_S3	If we acquire ownership of any property through foreclosure of an MRB, Properties Management may provide property management services for such property and receive a fee payable out of property revenues.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P51_S0	The Partnership s sole limited partner is America First Fiduciary Corporation Number Five, a Nebraska corporation.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P52_S0	BUCs represent assignments by the sole limited partner of its rights and obligations as a limited partner to outside third-party investors.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P52_S1	Because each such outside third party effectively holds a share of the sole limited partner s rights and obligations as a limited partner, BUCs are also referred to herein as Units for purposes of calculating amounts per BUC, and the holders thereof are referred to as Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P53_S0	Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, other reports filed with the SEC and press releases issued are available free of charge at www.ataxfund.com as soon as reasonably practical after they are filed with the SEC.
1059142_18_ITEM1_P53_S1	The information on the website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S0	Cash distributions from us may change depending on the amount of cash available for distribution.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S1	Throughout 2017, cash distributions were made to Unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per Unit.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S2	The amount of the cash per Unit distributed by the Partnership may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available to us for this purpose, as well as other factors it may deem to be relevant.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S3	During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we generated Cash Available for Distribution of $0.60 and $0.50 per Unit, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S4	Although we may supplement our cash available for distribution with unrestricted cash, unless we can increase our cash receipts through completion of our current investment plans, we may need to reduce the level of cash distributions per unit from the current level.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S5	In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current level of annual cash distributions per unit even if we complete our current investment plans.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P0_S6	Any change in our distribution policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P1_S0	The receipt of interest and principal payments on our MRBs will be affected by the economic results of the underlying Residential Properties and a commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P1_S1	Although our MRBs are issued by state or local housing authorities, they are not obligations of these governmental entities and are not backed by any taxing authority.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P1_S2	Instead, each of these MRBs is backed by a non-recourse loan made to the owner of the underlying Residential Properties and commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P2_S0	generated by the operation of the financed property and the net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property, (except in cases where a property owner has provided a limited guarantee of certain payments).
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P2_S1	This makes our investments in these MRBs subject to risks usually associated with direct investments in multifamily real estate.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P3_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay its debt service obligations on our MRB on the property, a default may occur.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P3_S1	Net cash flow and net sale proceeds from a property are applied only to debt service payments of the MRB secured by that property and are not available to satisfy debt service obligations on other MRBs that we hold.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P4_S0	In addition, the value of a property at the time of its sale or refinancing will be a direct function of its perceived future profitability.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P4_S1	Therefore, the amount of base and contingent interest that we earn on our MRBs, and whether or not we will receive the entire principal balance of the bonds as and when due, will depend to a large degree on the economic results of the underlying properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P5_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, government regulation, competition from other similar multifamily, student, or senior citizen residential properties, mortgage rates for single-family housing, and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P5_S1	In most of the markets in which the properties financed by our MRBs are located, there is significant competition from other multifamily and single-family housing that is either owned or leased by potential tenants.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P5_S2	Low mortgage interest rates and federal tax credits make single-family housing more accessible to persons who may otherwise rent apartments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P6_S0	The only source of repayment of our MRBs is principally dependent upon proceeds from the sale or refinancing of the underlying properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S0	The principal of most of our MRBs does not fully amortize over their terms.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S1	This means that all or some of the balance of the mortgage loans underlying these bonds will be repaid as a lump-sum balloon payment at the end of the term.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S2	The ability of the property owners to repay the mortgage loans with balloon payments is dependent upon their ability to sell the properties securing our MRBs or obtain adequate refinancing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S3	The MRBs are not personal obligations of the property owners, and we rely solely on the value of the properties securing these bonds for security.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S4	Similarly, if a MRB goes into default, our only recourse is to foreclose on the underlying property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P7_S5	If the value of the underlying property securing the bond is less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest on the bond, we will incur a loss.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P8_S0	The properties securing the our MRBs are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, with significant concentrations in certain states.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P8_S1	The properties securing the our MRBs are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, with significant concentrations in certain states.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P8_S2	Such concentrations expose us to potentially negative effects of local or regional economic downturns, which could prevent us from collecting interest and principal on our MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P9_S0	There is additional credit risk when we make a taxable loan on a property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P9_S1	The taxable property loans that we make to owners of the Residential Properties that secure MRBs held by us are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P9_S2	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments on these taxable property loans is the net cash flow generated by these properties or the net proceeds from the sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P10_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many things as discussed above.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P10_S1	In addition, any payment of principal and interest on a taxable property loan on a particular property will be subordinate to payment of all principal and interest (including contingent interest) on the MRB secured by the same property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P10_S2	As a result, there is a higher risk of default on the taxable property loans than on the associated MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P11_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net cash flow at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on the taxable property loan on such property, a default may occur.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P11_S1	While these taxable property loans are secured by the underlying properties, in general, we do not expect to pursue foreclosure or other remedies against a property upon default of a taxable property loan if the property is not in default on the MRBs financing the property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P12_S0	There are risks associated with our strategy of acquiring ownership interests in MF Properties in anticipation of future bond financings of these projects.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P12_S1	To facilitate our investment strategy of acquiring additional MRBs secured by Residential Properties, we may acquire ownership positions in MF Properties that we expect to ultimately sell as part of a syndication of LIHTCs after the expiration of the compliance period relating to existing LIHTCs issued with respect to the MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P12_S2	Our plan is to provide MRB financing to the new property owners at the time of a syndication of new LIHTCs in connection with a rehabilitation of these MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P13_S0	The market for LIHTC syndications may be negatively affected from time to time by economic and market conditions, including the potential for corporate tax reform in the U.S.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P13_S1	For this and other reasons, we may not be able to sell our interest in these MF Properties after the applicable LIHTC compliance period.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P13_S2	In addition, the value of our interest in these MF Properties will be affected by the economic performance of the MF Properties and other factors generally affecting the value of residential rental properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P14_S0	incur a loss upon the sale of our interest in an MF Property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P14_S1	In addition, we may not be able to acquire MRBs on the MF Properties even if we are able to sell our interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P14_S2	During the time we own an interest in an MF Property, any net income we receive from these MF Properties will not be exempt from federal or state income taxation.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P14_S3	Any future issuances of additional BUCs could cause their market value to decline.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P15_S0	We may issue additional BUCs from time to time to raise additional equity capital.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P15_S1	The issuance of additional BUCs will cause dilution of the existing BUCs and may cause a decrease in the market price of the BUCs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P15_S2	In addition, if additional units are issued but we are unable to invest the additional equity capital in assets that generate what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income at levels at least equivalent to our existing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may decline.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P16_S0	We may suffer adverse consequences from changing interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P16_S1	We have financed the acquisition of some of our assets using variable-rate debt financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P16_S2	The interest that we pay on these financings fluctuates with specific interest rate indices.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P16_S3	Our MRBs bear interest at fixed rates and, notwithstanding the contingent interest feature on some of these bonds, the amount of interest we earn on these bonds will not increase with a general rise in interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P16_S4	Accordingly, an increase in our interest expense due to an increase in the applicable interest rate index used for our variable rate debt financing will reduce the amount of cash we have available for distribution to Unitholders and may affect the market value of our BUCs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P17_S0	Our use of derivatives is designed to mitigate some but not all of the exposure to the negative impact of a higher cost of borrowing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P17_S1	An increase in interest rates could also decrease the market value of assets owned by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P17_S2	A decrease in the market value of assets owned by the Partnership could also decrease the amount we could realize on the sale of our investments and would thereby decrease the amount of funds available for distribution to our Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P17_S3	During periods of low prevailing interest rates, the interest rates we earn on new interest-bearing assets we acquire may be lower than the interest rates on our existing portfolio of interest-bearing assets.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P17_S4	To the extent we finance the acquisition of additional interest-bearing assets through the issuance of additional BUC s, from the issuance of preferred units or from the proceeds from the sale of existing assets held by the Partnership and we earn a lower interest rate on these additional interest-bearing assets, the amount of cash available for distribution on a per unit basis may be reduced.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S0	High interest rates may make it difficult for us to finance or refinance our debt obligations, which could reduce the number of investments we can acquire, our cash flow from operations and the amount of cash distributions we can make.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S1	If debt is unavailable at reasonable rates, we may not be able to finance the purchase of additional investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S2	If we place debt on our investments, we run the risk of being unable to refinance the debt when it becomes due or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S3	If interest rates are higher when we refinance, our income could be reduced.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S4	If any of these events occurs, our cash flow would be reduced.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P18_S5	This, in turn, would reduce cash available for distribution and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more stock or borrowing more money.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S0	We are subject to various risks associated with our derivative agreements.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S1	We use derivative instruments to mitigate some, but not all, of the risks to which we are exposed from changing interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S2	There is no assurance that these instruments will fully insulate us from the interest rate risks to which we are exposed.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S3	In addition, there are costs associated with these derivative instruments and these costs may not ultimately exceed the losses we would have suffered, if any, had these instruments not been in place.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S4	There is also a risk that the counterparty to such an instrument will be unable to perform its obligations to us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S5	If a liquid secondary market does not exist for these instruments, we may be required to maintain a derivative position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses to us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S6	In addition, we are required to record the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial statements by recording changes in their values as interest earnings or expense.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P19_S7	This can result in significant period to period volatility in our reported net income over the term of these instruments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P20_S0	There are risks associated with debt financing programs that involve securitization of our MRBs and PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P20_S1	We have obtained debt financing through the securitization of our MRBs and PHC Certificates and may obtain this type of debt financing in the future.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P20_S2	The terms of these securitization programs differ, but in general require our investment assets be placed into a trust or other special purpose entity that issues a senior security to unaffiliated investors and a residual interest to us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P20_S3	The trust or other entity receives all the interest payments from its underlying MRBs and PHC Certificates from which it pays interest on the senior security at a variable or fixed rate.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P21_S0	holding the securitized asset after it has paid the full amount of interest due on the senior security and all of the expenses of the trust, including various fees to the trustee, remarketing agents, credit providers, and liquidity providers.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P22_S0	Specific risks generally associated with these asset securitization programs include the following: Changes in short-term interest rates can adversely affect the cost of an asset securitization financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P23_S0	The interest rate payable on the senior securities resets periodically based on the weekly Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ( SIFMA ) floating index usually tied to interest rates on short-term instruments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P23_S1	In addition, because the senior securities may typically be tendered back to the trust, causing the trust to remarket the senior securities from time to time, an increase in interest rates may require an increase to the interest rate paid on the senior securities in order to successfully remarket these securities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P23_S2	Any increase in interest rate payable on the senior securities will result in more of the underlying interest being used to pay interest on the senior securities leaving less interest available to us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P23_S3	Higher short-term interest rates will reduce, and could even eliminate, our return on a residual interest in this type of financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P23_S4	Payments on the residual interests in these financing structures are subordinate to payments on the senior securities and to payment of trust expenses and there are no party guarantees to the payment of any amounts under the residual interests.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P24_S0	We hold a residual interest (known as Class B interests in the TEBS Financing with Freddie Mac, Term TOB Trust and Term A/B Trust facilities with Deutsche Bank and residual participating interests ( LIFERs ) in the TOB financing facilities) in the securitization trusts established for the debt financing facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P24_S1	These residual interests are subordinate to the senior securities sold to investors.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P24_S2	As a result, none of the interest received by such a trust will be paid to us as the holder of a residual interest until all payments currently due on the senior securities have been paid in full and other trust expenses satisfied.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P24_S3	As the holder of a residual certificate in these trusts, we can look only to the assets of the trust remaining after payment of these senior obligations for payment on the residual certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P24_S4	No third party guarantees the payment of any amount on the residual certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S0	Termination of an asset securitization financing can occur for many reasons which could cause us to lose the assets and other collateral we pledged for such financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S1	In general, the trust or other special purpose entity formed for an asset securitization financing can terminate for many different reasons relating to problems with the assets or problems with the trust itself.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S2	Problems with the assets that could cause the trust to collapse include payment or other defaults or a determination that the interest on the assets is taxable.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S3	Problems with a trust include a downgrade in the investment rating of the senior securities that it has issued, a ratings downgrade of the liquidity provider for the trust, increases in short term interest rates in excess of the interest paid on the underlying assets, an inability to remarket the senior securities or an inability to obtain credit or liquidity for the trust.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S4	In each of these cases, the trust will be collapsed and the MRBs and other collateral held by the trusts will be sold.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S5	If the proceeds from the sale of the trust collateral are not sufficient to pay the principal amount of the senior securities with accrued interest and the other expenses of the trusts then we will be required, through our guarantee of the trusts, to fund any such shortfall.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S6	The Partnership, as holder of the residual interest in the trust, may not only lose our investment in the residual certificates but could also realize additional losses to fully repay trust obligations to the senior securities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S7	An insolvency or receivership of the program sponsor could impair our ability to recover the assets and other collateral pledged by it in connection with a bond securitization financing.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S8	In the event the sponsor of an asset securitization financing program becomes insolvent, it could be placed in receivership.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P25_S9	In that situation, it is possible that we would not be able to recover the investment assets and other collateral it pledged in connection with the securitization financing or that it would not receive all or any of the payments due from the trust or other special purpose entity on the residual interest held by us in such trust or other entity.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P26_S0	Conditions in the tax credit markets due to known or potential changes in U.S. corporate tax rates may increase our cost of borrowing, make financing difficult to obtain or restrict our ability to invest in MRBs and other investments, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P26_S1	Conditions in the tax credit market due to changes in the U.S. corporate tax rates have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our cost of borrowings and may restrict our ability to invest in MRBs and other investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P26_S2	It is unclear when and how quickly conditions will stabilize in the tax credit markets.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P26_S3	These conditions, the cost and availability of credit has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected in all markets in which we operate.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P27_S0	Concern about the stability of the tax credit markets has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease, providing funding to borrowers.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P27_S1	Our access to debt and equity financing may be adversely affected.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P28_S0	our ability to replace or renew maturing debt financing on a timely basis, may impair our ability to acquire MRBs and other investments and may impair our access to capital markets to meet our liquidity and growth requirements which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P29_S0	Federal regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may require us to unwind our tender option bond financing facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S0	The Volcker Rule adopted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 limits the ability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain types of covered funds (such as private equity funds and hedge funds) or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading in the U.S.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S1	The Volcker Rule restricts banking entities from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with certain covered funds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S2	As currently structured, TOB Trusts like those used as part of our TOB financing program with DB, fit within the definition of covered funds and will be affected by the Volcker Rule.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S3	The Volcker Rule does not apply to Freddie Mac or more specifically, the M24, M31 and M33 TEBS Financing facilities with Freddie Mac.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S4	The regulators specifically noted that banks will need to evaluate if TOB Trusts are, in fact, covered funds and if so, whether an exception to the definition is available.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S5	The regulators declined to provide a specific exclusion from the definition of covered funds for TOB financing programs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P30_S6	The preamble also notes that participation in a TOB transaction is not prohibited per se, but is subject to the same restrictions on other covered funds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P31_S0	Any downgrade, or perceived potential of a downgrade, of U.S. sovereign credit ratings or the credit ratings of the U.S. Government-sponsored entities (or GSEs) by the various credit rating agencies may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P31_S1	Our TEBS Financing facilities are an integral part of our business strategy and those financings are dependent upon an investment grade rating of Freddie Mac.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P31_S2	If Freddie Mac were downgraded to below investment grade, it would have a negative effect on our ability to finance our bond portfolio on a longer-term basis and could negatively impact Cash Available for Distribution and our ability to continue distributions at current levels.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P31_S3	The federal conservatorship of Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P32_S0	The problems faced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac commencing in 2008 resulting in them being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving significant U.S. Government support have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S. Government in providing liquidity and credit enhancement for mortgage loans.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P32_S1	The Trump administration has publicly indicated a desire to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including their relationship with the federal government.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P32_S2	As a result, the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are likely to be reduced (perhaps significantly) and the nature of their guarantee obligations could be considerably limited relative to historical measurements.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P32_S3	Alternatively, it is still possible that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be dissolved entirely or privatized, and, as mentioned above, the U.S. Government could determine to stop providing liquidity support of any kind to the mortgage market.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P33_S0	Any changes to the nature of the GSEs or their guarantee obligations could have broad adverse implications for the market and our business, operations and financial condition.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P33_S1	If Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were to be eliminated, or their structures were to change radically (i.e., limitation or removal of the guarantee obligation), our ability to utilize TEBS Financings facilities would be materially and adversely impacted.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P33_S2	Our MRBs, PHC Certificates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities are illiquid assets and their value may decrease.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P34_S0	Our MRBs, PHC Certificates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities are relatively illiquid, and there is no existing trading market for them.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P34_S1	There are no market makers, price quotations, or other indications of a developed trading market for these investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P34_S2	In addition, no rating has been issued on any of the existing MRBs and we do not expect to obtain ratings on MRBs we may acquire in the future.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P34_S3	Accordingly, any buyer of these MRBs would need to perform its own due diligence prior to a purchase.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P35_S0	The Partnership s ability to sell its MRBs, PHC Certificates, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities and the price it may receive upon their sale, will be affected by the number of potential buyers, the number of similar securities on the market at the time and by other market conditions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P35_S1	Such a sale could result in a loss to the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S0	Delay, reduction, or elimination of appropriations from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can result in payment defaults on our investments in PHC Trusts.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S1	We have acquired interests, LIFERS, in three PHC TOB Trusts, which, in turn, hold PHC Certificates that have been issued by three PHC Trusts which hold custodial receipts evidencing loans made to numerous public housing authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S2	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S3	Annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program must be determined by Congress each year, and there is no assurance that Congress will continue to make such appropriations at current levels or at all.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S4	If Congress fails to continue to make annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds from which to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S5	The failure of public housing authorities to pay principal and interest on these loans will reduce or eliminate the payments received by us from the PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S6	A reduction in the rating of PHC Certificates below investment grade would result in the liquidation of the investment in that TOB Trust Our investment in PHC Certificates is made pursuant to the provision of our Amended and Restated LP Agreement that allows investment in securities that are not MRBs backed by multifamily housing projects provided that these alternative securities are rated investment grade in one of the four highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognized securities rating agency and provide what we expect and believe to be tax-exempt income.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S7	In the event the investment rating of any of the PHC Certificates held by a PHC TOB Trust was reduced to less than investment grade, the trustee of the TOB Trust has no obligation to divest of that securitized asset.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P36_S8	Accordingly, we would be required to liquidate our LIFERS in that TOB Trust or liquidate the TOB Trust entirely.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P37_S0	The TOB Trusts have no obligation to purchase the LIFERS and there is no established trading market for the LIFERS.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P37_S1	Likewise, if we liquidate the TOB Trust, any downgrade in the investment rating of the PHC Certificates will likely decrease the value of the investment.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P37_S2	The partnership may not be able to divest its position in these LIFERS or terminate the TOB Trusts without incurring a material loss.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S0	The rent restrictions and occupant income limitations imposed on properties financed by our MRBs and on our MF Properties may limit the revenues of such properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S1	All of the Residential Properties securing our MRBs and the MF Properties in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests are subject to certain federal, state and/or local requirements with respect to the permissible income of their tenants.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S2	Since federal rent subsidies are not generally available on these properties, rents must be charged on a designated portion of the units at a level to permit these units to be continuously occupied by low or moderate-income persons or families.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S3	As a result, these rents may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs with respect to these units and debt service on the applicable MRB.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S4	This may force the property owner, when permissible, to charge rents on the remaining units that are higher than they would be otherwise and may, therefore, exceed competitive rents.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P38_S5	This may adversely affect the occupancy rate of a property securing an investment and the property owner s ability to service its debt.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S0	The properties financed by some of our MRBs are not completely insured against damages from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S1	Two of the multifamily housing properties financed by MRBs held by us and one MF Property are in an area prone to damage from hurricanes and other major storms.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S2	Due to the significant losses incurred by insurance companies in recent years due to damages from hurricanes, many property and casualty insurers now require property owners to assume the risk of first loss on a larger percentage of their property s value.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S3	In general, the current insurance policies on the property financed by us that is located in an area rated for hurricane and storm exposure carry a five percent deductible on the insurable value of the properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S4	As a result, if either of these properties were damaged in a hurricane or other major storm, the amount of uninsured losses could be significant, and the property owner may not have the resources to fully rebuild the property, which could result in a default on the MRBs secured by the property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S5	In addition, the damages to a property may result in all or a portion of the rental units not being rentable for a period of time.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P39_S6	Unless a property owner carries rental interruption insurance, this loss of rental income would reduce the cash flow available to pay base or contingent interest on our MRBs collateralized by these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P40_S0	The properties securing our MRBs or the MF Properties may be subject to liability for environmental contamination which could increase the risk of default on such bonds or loss of our investment.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P41_S0	The owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on its property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P41_S1	Various federal, state and local laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator of real property knew of, or was responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P42_S0	We cannot assure you that the properties that secure our MRBs or the MF Properties, in which our subsidiaries hold indirect interests, will not be contaminated.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P42_S1	The costs associated with the remediation of any such contamination may be significant and may exceed the value of a property or result in the property owner defaulting on the revenue bond secured by the property or otherwise result in a loss of our investment in a property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S0	If we acquire ownership of Residential Properties, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the ownership of commercial real estate.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S1	We may acquire ownership of Residential Properties financed by MRBs held by us in the event of a default on such bonds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S2	We may also acquire indirect ownership of MF Properties on a temporary basis in order to facilitate the eventual acquisition by us of MRBs on these MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S3	In either case, during the time we own an MF Property, we will generate taxable income or losses from the operations of such property rather than tax exempt interest.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S4	In addition, we will be subject to all of the risks normally associated with the operation of commercial real estate including declines in property value, occupancy and rental rates, increases in operating expenses, and the ability to refinance if needed.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P43_S5	We may also be subject to government regulations, natural disasters and environmental issues, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and ability to make distributions to Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S0	There are many risks related to the construction of Residential Properties that may affect the MRBs issued to finance these properties and multifamily properties that underlie our Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S1	We may invest in MRBs secured by residential housing properties, and we make equity investments in limited liability companies created to develop, construct and operate multifamily properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S2	Construction of such properties generally takes approximately twelve to eighteen months.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S3	The principal risk associated with these investment activities is that construction of the underlying properties may be substantially delayed or never completed.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S4	This may occur for many reasons including (i) insufficient financing to complete the project due to underestimated construction costs or cost overruns; (ii) failure of contractors or subcontractors to perform under their agreements; (iii) inability to obtain governmental approvals; (iv) labor disputes; and (v) adverse weather and other unpredictable contingencies beyond the control of the developer.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S5	While we may be able to protect ourselves from some of these risks by obtaining construction completion guarantees from developers, agreements of construction lenders to purchase our bonds if construction is not completed on time, and/or payment and performance bonds from contractors, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees or bonds may not fully protect us in the event a property is not completed.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P44_S6	In other cases, we may decide to forego certain types of available security if we determine that the security is not necessary or is too expensive to obtain in relation to the risks covered.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S0	If a property is not completed or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less than the full amount of interest owed to us on the mortgage revenue bond financing such property or otherwise result in a default under the mortgage loan that secures our mortgage revenue bond on the property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S1	In such case, we may be forced to foreclose on the incomplete property and sell it in order to recover the principal and accrued interest on our mortgage revenue bond and we may suffer a loss of capital as a result.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S2	Alternatively, we may decide to finance the remaining construction of the property, in which event we will need to invest additional funds into the property, either as equity or as a taxable property loan.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S3	Any return on this additional investment would be taxable.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S4	Also, if we foreclose on a property, we will no longer receive interest on the bond issued to finance the property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S5	The overall return to us from our investment in such property is likely to be less than if the construction had been completed on time or within budget.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S6	As it relates to our equity investments, if a property is not completed or costs more to complete than anticipated, it may cause us to receive less distributions than expected.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P45_S7	Furthermore, we may be prevented from receiving a return on our investments or recovering our initial investment, which would likely adversely affect our results of operations.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P46_S0	There are many risks related to the lease-up of newly constructed or renovated properties that may affect the MRBs issued to finance these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P47_S0	We may acquire MRBs issued to finance properties in various stages of construction or renovation.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P47_S1	As construction or renovation is completed, these properties will move into the lease-up phase.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P47_S2	The lease-up of these properties may not be completed on schedule or at anticipated rent levels, resulting in a greater risk these investments may go into default rather than investments secured by mortgages on properties that are stabilized or fully leased-up.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P47_S3	The underlying property may not achieve expected occupancy or debt service coverage levels.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P47_S4	While we may require property developers to provide us with a guarantee covering operating deficits of the property during the lease-up phase, we may not be able to do so in all cases or such guarantees may not fully protect us in the event a property is not leased to an adequate level of economic occupancy as anticipated.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P48_S0	There are various risks associated with our Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P48_S1	Our Investments in Unconsolidated Entities represent equity investments in limited liability companies created to develop, construct and operate multifamily properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P48_S2	We are entitled to certain distributions under the terms of the investees governing documents based on the availability of cash to pay such distributions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P48_S3	The only sources of cash flows for such distributions are either the net cash flows from the operation of the property, the cash proceeds from a sale of the property, or through the permanent financing in the form of a mortgage revenue bond.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P49_S0	The net cash flow from the operation of a property may be affected by many factors, such as the number of tenants, the rental and fee rates, operating expenses, the cost of repairs and maintenance, taxes, debt service requirements, competition from other similar multifamily properties and general and local economic conditions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P50_S0	Sale proceeds are primarily dependent, among other things, on the value of a property to a prospective buyer at the time of its sale.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P50_S1	If there are no net cash flows from operations or insufficient proceeds from a sale or a refinancing event, we are unlikely to receive distributions from our investees and we may be unable to recover our investments in these entities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P51_S0	There is a risk associated with a third-party developer that has provided guarantees of our returns on Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P51_S1	One developer has provided a guarantee of returns on our Investments in Unconsolidated Entities during the period of construction of the underlying multifamily property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P51_S2	The guarantees remain through the two-year anniversary of construction completion of each multifamily property up to a maximum amount for each investment.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P52_S0	If the underlying multifamily properties do not generate sufficient cash proceeds, either through net cash flows from operations or upon a sale event or through the permanent financing in the form of a mortgage revenue bond, then we are entitled to enforce the guarantee against the developer.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P52_S1	If the developer is unable to perform on the guarantee, we may be prevented from realizing our returns earned on our Investments in Unconsolidated Entities during the period of construction which may result in the recognition of losses.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P53_S0	We have assumed certain potential liabilities relating to recapture of tax credits on MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P53_S1	We have acquired indirect interests in several MF Properties that generated LIHTCs for the previous investors in these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P53_S2	When we acquire an interest in an MF Property, we generally must agree to reimburse the prior partners for any liabilities they incur due to a recapture of LIHTCs that result from the failure to operate the MF Property in a manner consistent with the laws and regulations relating to LIHTCs after we acquired our interest in the MF Property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P53_S3	The amount of this recapture liability can be substantial and could negatively impact the financial performance of the MF Property.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P54_S0	We are not registered under the Investment Company Act.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P54_S1	We are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ) because we operate under an exemption therefrom.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P54_S2	As a result, none of the protections of the Investment Company Act (such as provisions relating to disinterested directors, custody requirements for securities, and regulation of the relationship between a fund and its advisor) will be applicable to us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P55_S0	We engage in transactions with related parties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S0	The majority of executive officers of Burlington, the named executive officers of the Partnership, and four of the Managers of Burlington hold equity positions in Burlington.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S1	A subsidiary of Burlington acts as our General Partner and manages our investments and performs administrative services for us and earns certain fees that are either paid by the properties financed by our MRBs or by us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S2	Another subsidiary of Burlington provides on-site management for some of the Residential Properties that underlie our MRBs and each of our MF Properties earns fees from the property owners based on the gross revenues of these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S3	The owners of the limited-purpose corporations which own two of the Residential Properties financed with MRBs and taxable property loans held by us are employees of Burlington who are not involved in our operation or management and who are not executive officers or managers of Burlington.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S4	These two Residential Properties are Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks, which were sold during 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S5	Because of these relationships, our agreements with Burlington and its subsidiaries are related-party transactions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S6	By their nature, related-party transactions may not be considered to have been negotiated at arm s length.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P56_S7	These relationships may also cause a conflict of interest in other situations where we are negotiating with Burlington.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P57_S0	Unitholders may incur tax liability if any of the interest on our MRBs or PHC Certificates is determined to be taxable.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P57_S1	In each MRB transaction, the governmental issuer, as well as the underlying borrower, has covenanted and agreed to comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements necessary to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of interest earned on the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P58_S0	income tax purposes retroactive to the date of issuance, regardless of when such noncompliance occurs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P59_S0	Should the interest income on a MRB be deemed to be taxable, the bond documents include a variety of rights and remedies that we have concluded would help mitigate the economic impact of taxation of the interest income on the affected bonds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P59_S1	Under such circumstances, we would enforce all of such rights and remedies as set forth in the related bond documents as well as any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P59_S2	In addition, in the event the tax-exemption of interest income on any MRB is challenged by the IRS, we would participate in the tax and legal proceedings to contest any such challenge and would, under appropriate circumstances, appeal any adverse final determinations.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P59_S3	The loss of tax-exemption for any particular issue of bonds would not, in and of itself, result in the loss of tax-exemption for any unrelated issue of bonds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P59_S4	However, the loss of such tax-exemption could result in the distribution to our Unitholders of taxable income relating to such bonds.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S0	Certain of our MRBs bear interest at rates which include contingent interest.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S1	Payment of the contingent interest depends on the amount of net cash flow generated by the property, net proceeds realized from the refinancing or sale of the property securing the bond.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S2	Due to this contingent interest feature, an issue may arise as to whether the relationship between the property owner and the Partnership is that of debtor and creditor or whether we are engaged in a partnership or joint venture with the property owner.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S3	If the IRS were to determine that these MRBs represented an equity investment in the underlying property, the interest paid to us could be viewed as a taxable return on such investment and would not qualify as tax-exempt interest for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S4	In addition, we have, and may in the future, obtain debt financing through asset securitization programs in which we place MRBs and PHC Certificates into trusts and are entitled to a share of the interest received by the trust on these bonds after the payment of interest on senior securities and related expenses issued by the trust.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P60_S5	It is possible that the characterization of our residual interest in such a securitization trust could be challenged and the income that we receive through these instruments could be treated as ordinary taxable income includable in our gross income for federal tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S0	Not all the income received by us is exempt from taxation.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S1	We have made, and may make in the future, taxable property loans to the owners of Residential Properties that collateralize our investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S2	The interest income earned by us on these taxable property loans is subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S3	In addition, if we acquire direct or indirect interests in real estate, either through foreclosure of a property securing a MRB or a taxable property loan or through the acquisition of an MF Property, any income we receive from the property will be taxable income from the operation of real estate.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S4	In that case, the taxable income received by us will be allocated to our Unitholders and will represent taxable income to them regardless of whether an amount of cash equal to such allocable share of this taxable income is distributed to Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P61_S5	Furthermore, income and gains generated by assets within a wholly-owned subsidiary (the Greens Hold Co ) and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local incomes as the Greens Hold Co is a C corporation for income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S0	If we were determined to be an association taxable as a corporation, it will have adverse economic consequences for us and our Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S1	We have determined to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S2	The purpose of this determination is to eliminate federal and state income tax liability for us and allow us to pass through our interest income which we expect and believe to be tax-exempt to our Unitholders so that they are not subject to federal tax on this income.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S3	If our treatment as a partnership for tax purposes is successfully challenged, we would be classified as an association taxable as a corporation.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S4	This would result in the Partnership being taxed on its taxable income, if any, and, in addition, would result in all cash distributions made by us to Unitholders being treated as taxable dividend income to the extent of our earnings and profits.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S5	The payment of these dividends would not be deductible by us.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P62_S6	The listing of our Units for trading on the NASDAQ causes us to be treated as a publicly traded partnership under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S0	A publicly traded partnership is generally taxable as a corporation unless 90% or more of its gross income is qualifying income.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S1	Qualifying income includes interest, dividends, real property rents, gain from the sale or other disposition of real property, gain from the sale or other disposition of capital assets held to produce interest or dividends, and certain other items.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S2	We expect and believe that substantially all of our gross income will continue to be tax-exempt interest income on our MRBs, but there can be no assurance that will be the case.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S3	While we believe that all of this interest income is qualifying income, it is possible that some or all of our income could be determined not to be qualifying income.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S4	In such a case, if more than ten percent of our annual gross income in any year is not qualifying income, we will be taxable as a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P63_S5	We have not received, and do not intend to seek, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding our status as a partnership for tax purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P64_S0	To the extent we generate taxable income; Unitholders will be subject to income taxes on this income, whether or not they receive cash distributions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P64_S1	As a partnership, our Unitholders will be individually liable for income tax on their proportionate share of any taxable income realized by us, whether or not we make cash distributions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P64_S2	There are limits on the ability of our Unitholders to deduct Partnership losses and expenses allocated to them.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P64_S3	The ability of Unitholders to deduct their proportionate share of the losses and expenses generated by us will be limited in certain cases, and certain transactions may result in the triggering of the Alternative Minimum Tax for Unitholders who are individuals.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P65_S0	Holders of the Series A Preferred Units may be required to bear the risks of an investment for an indefinite period of time.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P65_S1	Holders of the Series A Preferred Units may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series A Preferred Units for an indefinite period of time.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P65_S2	In addition, the Series A Preferred Units will rank junior to all Partnership current and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under the Partnership s senior bank credit facility) and other liabilities, and any other senior securities we may issue in the future with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P65_S3	The Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to existing and future debt obligations, and the interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional units, including additional Series A Preferred Units, and by other transactions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P65_S4	The Series A Preferred Units are subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, including indebtedness outstanding under any senior bank credit facility.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P66_S0	The Partnership may incur additional debt under its senior bank credit facility or future credit facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P66_S1	The payment of principal and interest on its debt reduces cash available for distribution to Unitholders, including the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P66_S2	The issuance of additional units pari passu with or senior to the Series A Preferred Units would dilute the interests of the holders of the Series A Preferred Units, and any issuance of senior securities, parity securities, or additional indebtedness could affect the Partnership s ability to pay distributions on or redeem the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P67_S0	Holders of Series A Preferred Units have extremely limited voting rights.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S0	The voting rights as a holder of Series A Preferred Units will be extremely limited.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S1	Our BUCs are the only class of our partnership interests carrying full voting rights.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S2	Holders of Series A Preferred Units generally have no voting rights.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S3	There is no public market for the Series A Preferred Units, which may prevent an investor from liquidating its investment.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S4	The Series A Preferred Units were offered in a private placement and the Partnership did not register the Series A Preferred Units with the SEC or any state securities commission.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S5	The Series A Preferred Units may not be resold unless the Partnership registers the securities with the SEC or an exemption from the registration requirement is available.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S6	It is not expected that any market for the Series A Preferred Units will develop or be sustained in the future.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P68_S7	The lack of any public market for the Series A Preferred Units severely limits the ability to liquidate the investment, except for the right to put the Series A Preferred Units to the Partnership under certain circumstances.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P69_S0	Market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P69_S1	One of the factors that will influence the value of the Series A Preferred Units will be the distribution rate on the Series A Preferred Units (as a percentage of the price of the units) relative to market interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P69_S2	An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lower the value of the Series A Preferred Units and also would likely increase the Partnership s borrowing costs.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P70_S0	Holders of Series A Preferred Units may have liability to repay distributions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P70_S1	Under certain circumstances, holders of the Series A Preferred Units may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P71_S0	Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution if the distribution would cause the Partnership s liabilities to exceed the fair value of its assets.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P71_S1	Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P72_S0	Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P72_S1	A purchaser of Series A Preferred Units who becomes a limited partner is liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to the Partnership that are known to such purchaser of units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from our Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P73_S0	The Partnership s portfolio investment decisions may create CRA strategy risks.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P73_S1	Portfolio investment decisions take into account the Partnership s goal of holding MRBs and other securities in designated geographic areas and will not be exclusively based on the investment characteristics of such assets, which may or may not have an adverse effect on the Partnership s investment performance.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P73_S2	CRA qualified assets in geographic areas sought by the Partnership may not provide as favorable return as CRA qualified assets in other geographic areas.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P73_S3	The Partnership may sell assets for reasons relating to CRA qualification at times when such sales may not be desirable and may hold short-term investments that produce relatively low yields pending the selection of long-term investments believed to be CRA-qualified.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P74_S0	Under certain circumstances, investors may not receive CRA credit for their investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P75_S0	The CRA requires the three federal bank supervisory agencies, the FRB, the OCC, and the FDIC, to encourage the institutions they regulate to help meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P75_S1	Each agency has promulgated rules for evaluating and rating an institution s CRA performance which, as the following summary indicates, vary according to an institution s asset size.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P75_S2	An institution s CRA performance can also be adversely affected by evidence of discriminatory credit practices regardless of its asset size.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S0	For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to an investment in the Series A Preferred Units, the Partnership must hold CRA-qualifying investments that relate to the institution s delineated CRA assessment area.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S1	The Partnership expects that an investment in its units will be considered a qualified investment under the CRA, but neither the Partnership nor the General Partner has received an interpretative letter from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ( FFIEC ) stating that an investment in the Partnership is considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S2	Moreover, there is no guarantee that future changes to the CRA or future interpretations by the FFIEC will not affect the continuing eligibility of the Partnership s investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S3	So that the Partnership itself may be considered a qualified investment, the Partnership will seek to invest only in investments that meet the prevailing community investing standards put forth by U.S. regulatory agencies.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S4	In this regard, the Partnership expects that a majority of its investments will be considered eligible for regulatory credit under the CRA, but there is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for its investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P76_S5	For example, a state banking regulator may not consider the Partnership eligible for regulatory credit.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P77_S0	If CRA credit is not given, there is a risk that an investor may not fulfill its CRA requirements.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P77_S1	The assets held by the Partnership may not be considered qualified investments under the CRA by the bank regulatory authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P77_S2	In most cases, qualified investments, as defined by the CRA, are required to be responsive to the community development needs of a financial institution s delineated CRA assessment area or a broader statewide or regional area that includes the institution s assessment area.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P78_S0	For an institution to receive CRA credit with respect to the Series A Preferred Units, the Partnership must hold CRA qualifying investments that relate to the institution s assessment area.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P78_S1	As defined in the CRA, qualified investments are any lawful investments, deposits, membership shares, or grants that have as their primary purpose community development.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P78_S2	The term community development is defined in the CRA as: (1) affordable housing (including multifamily rental housing) for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) community services targeted to low- or moderate-income individuals; (3) activities that promote economic development by financing businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of 13 C.F.R. 121.802(a)(2) and (3) or have gross annual revenues of $1 million or less; or (4) activities that revitalize or stabilize low- or moderate-income geographies, designated disaster areas, or distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income geographies designated by the federal banking regulators.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P79_S0	Investments are not typically designated as qualifying investments at the time of issuance by any governmental agency.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P79_S1	Accordingly, the General Partner must evaluate whether each potential investment may be qualifying investments with respect to a specific Unitholder.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P79_S2	The final determinations that assets held by the Partnership are qualifying investments are made by the federal and, where applicable, state bank supervisory agencies during their periodic examinations of financial institutions.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P79_S3	There is no assurance that the agencies will concur with the General Partner s evaluation of any of the Partnership s assets as qualifying investments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P80_S0	Each investor will be a limited partner of the Partnership, not just of the investments in its Designated Target Region(s).
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P80_S1	The financial returns on an investor s investment will be determined based on the performance of all the assets in the Partnership s geographically diverse portfolio, not just by the performance of the assets in the Designated Target Region(s) selected by the investor.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P80_S2	In determining whether a particular investment is qualified, the General Partner will assess whether the investment has as its primary purpose community development.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P80_S3	The General Partner will consider whether the investment: (1) provides affordable housing for low- to moderate-income individuals; (2) provides community services targeted to low- to moderate-income individuals; (3) funds activities that (a) finance businesses or farms that meet the size eligibility standards of the Small Business Administration s Development Company or Small Business Investment Company programs or have annual revenues of $1 million or less and (b) promote economic development; or (4) funds activities that revitalize or stabilize low- to moderate-income areas.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P80_S4	For institutions whose primary regulator is the FRB, OCC, or FDIC, the General Partner may also consider whether an investment revitalizes or stabilizes a designated disaster area, or an area designated by those agencies as a distressed or underserved non-metropolitan middle-income area.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P81_S0	An activity may be deemed to promote economic development if it supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement for persons who are currently low- to moderate-income, or supports permanent job creation, retention, and/or improvement in low- to moderate-income areas targeted for redevelopment by federal, state, local, or tribal governments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P82_S0	Activities that revitalize or stabilize a low- to moderate-income geography are activities that help attract and retain businesses and residents.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P83_S0	The General Partner maintains documentation, readily available to a financial institution or an examiner, supporting its determination that a Partnership asset is a qualifying investment for CRA purposes.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P84_S0	Obligations of U.S. Government agencies, authorities, instrumentalities, and sponsored enterprises (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P84_S1	However, the maximum potential liability of the issuers of some of these securities may greatly exceed their current resources and no assurance can be given that the U.S. Government would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so contractually or by law.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P85_S0	The investment in the Series A Preferred Units is not a deposit or obligation of, or insured or guaranteed by, any entity or person, including the U.S. Government and the FDIC.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P86_S0	The value of the Partnership s assets will vary, reflecting changes in market conditions, interest rates, and other political and economic factors.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P86_S1	There is no assurance that the Partnership can achieve its investment objective, since all investments are inherently subject to market risk.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P86_S2	There also can be no assurance that either the Partnership s investments or units of the Partnership will receive investment test credit under the CRA.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S0	The Partnership faces legislative and regulatory risks in connection with its assets and operations, including under the CRA.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S1	Many aspects of the Partnership s investment objectives are directly affected by the national and local legal and regulatory environments.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S2	Changes in laws, regulations, or the interpretation of regulations could all pose risks to the successful realization of the Partnership s investment objectives.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S3	It is not known what changes, if any, may be made to the CRA in the future and what impact these changes could have on regulators or the various states that have their own versions of the CRA.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S4	Changes in the CRA might affect Partnership operations and might pose a risk to the successful realization of the Partnership s investment objectives.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S5	Repeal of the CRA would significantly reduce the attractiveness of an investment in the Partnership s units for regulated investors.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S6	There is no guarantee that an investor will receive CRA credit for is investment in the Series A Preferred Units.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S7	If CRA credit is not given, there is a risk that an investor may not fulfill its CRA obligations.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S8	We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber-attacks, security problems, and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S9	We are increasingly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P87_S10	If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P88_S0	issues in a timely manner, our revenues, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P88_S1	In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation risks, and reputational damage from leakage of confidential information or from systems conversions when, and if, they occur in the normal course of business.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P88_S2	The inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P88_S3	Negative posts or comments about the Partnership on any social networking web site could seriously damage its reputation.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P88_S4	In addition, the disclosure of non-public company sensitive information through external media channels could lead to information loss.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P89_S0	Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand presents new challenges.
1059142_18_ITEM1A_P89_S1	Any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our BUCs.
1059142_18_ITEM2_P0_S0	Each of the Partnership s MRBs are collateralized by the Residential Properties or commercial property.
1059142_18_ITEM2_P0_S1	The Partnership may have property loans that are also collateralized by the Residential Properties but does not hold title or any other interest in these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM2_P0_S2	At December 31, 2017, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership owns one MF Property The 50/50.
1059142_18_ITEM2_P0_S3	In addition, the Partnership owns the Suites on Paseo, Jade Park and land held for development directly.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P28_S3	During 2017, we re-designated the interest rate swaps from the Mortgage Revenue Bond Investments segment to this segment as they are now intended to mitigate interest rate risk for debt financings related to the PHC Certificates.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P30_S0	The decrease in total revenue between 2016 and 2015 is due to principal paydowns on the PHC Certificates totaling approximately $2.0 million during 2016, which resulted in lower interest income.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P31_S0	The decrease in net income between 2016 and 2015 is due to lower revenues discussed above and an increase in the average annual interest rate on the variable TOB Trust secured by the PHC Certificates from 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 2.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P69_S1	The property was considered stabilized when the MRB was acquired.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P70_S0	The MRB associated with the property was redeemed as of December 31, 2017, so the number of units and occupancy are not applicable as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S0	Overall physical occupancy increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the stabilization of the Columbia Gardens, Willow Run, Heights at 515 and Crossing at 1415 properties during 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S1	Overall physical occupancy for the stabilized Residential Properties increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the stabilization of the Concord at Gulfgate, Concord at Little York, Concord at Williamcrest, Bruton Apartments and Decatur Angle properties during 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S2	Physical occupancy also increased due to the addition of the Companion at Thornhill property during 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S3	Overall economic occupancy increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the stabilization of the Columbia Gardens, Willow Run, Heights at 515 and Crossing at 1415 properties during 2017 and continued ramp up of occupancy at Bruton Apartments and Decatur Angle.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S4	Overall economic occupancy decreased slightly from 2015 to 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S5	The decrease is due primarily to the recent stabilization of Bruton Apartments and Decatur Angle during 2016, which had no comparable prior year information.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S6	Non-Consolidated Properties - Not Stabilized The owners of the following properties either do not meet the definition of a VIE or we have evaluated and determined we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S7	As a result, we do not report the assets, liabilities and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S8	For the year ended December 31, 2017, these Residential Properties have not met the stabilization criteria (see footnote 3 below the table).
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S9	On December 31, 2017, debt service on our MRBs for the non-consolidated properties that are not stabilized was current.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P71_S10	The amounts presented below were obtained from records provided by the property owners and their related property management service providers.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P72_S0	Physical occupancy is defined as the total number of units occupied divided by total units at the date of measurement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P73_S0	Economic occupancy is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P73_S1	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P74_S0	Physical occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P74_S1	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P75_S0	(3) During 2017, these properties were under construction or renovation.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P75_S1	As such, these properties are not considered stabilized as they have not met the criteria for stabilization.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S0	Stabilization is generally defined as 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S1	(4) Previous period occupancy numbers are not available as these were new investments in 2016.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S3	(5) Previous period occupancy numbers are not available as these were new investments in 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S4	Physical occupancy decreased from 2016 to 2017 Primarily due to the addition of the Avistar at Copperfield, Avistar at Wilcrest and Avistar at Wood Hollow during 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S5	These properties are currently undergoing major rehabilitations and will likely experience an increase in occupancy during 2018 as rehabilitations are completed.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S6	Economic occupancy increased from 2016 to 2017 due to new MRBs related to rehabilitation projects in California in 2017 and in December 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S7	These properties had higher than normal occupancy for projects of this type due to a strong local market for multifamily housing.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S8	Physical and economic occupancy increased from 2015 to 2016 primarily due to the addition of non-stabilized Residential Properties with high occupancy in 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S9	These new Residential Properties may show a decline in physical and economic occupancy in the near term as the properties go through substantial rehabilitations.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S10	Properties At December 31, 2017, we owned three MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P76_S11	We report the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of these properties on a consolidated basis.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P79_S0	Economic occupancy is presented for December 31, 2015 and 2014 and is defined as the net rental income received divided by the maximum amount of rental income to be derived from each property.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P79_S1	This statistic is reflective of rental concessions, delinquent rents and non-revenue units such as model units and employee units.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P79_S2	Actual occupancy is a point in time measurement while economic occupancy is a measurement over the period presented.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P79_S3	Therefore, economic occupancy for a period may exceed the actual occupancy at any point in time.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P80_S0	Stabilization is generally defined as 90% occupancy for 90 days and an achievement of 1.15 times debt service coverage ratio on amortizing debt service for all MF Properties that are not student housing residential properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P80_S1	Suites on Paseo, Eagle Village, Northern View, and The 50/50 MF Property are student housing residential properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P81_S0	The overall increase in physical occupancy from 2016 to 2017 is due to a sharp increase in occupancy at The 50/50 during 2017, which is due to marketing and pricing changes implemented by the Partnership and Properties Management for fall 2017 lease-up.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P81_S1	The overall decrease in physical occupancy from 2015 to 2016 is due to declining occupancy at the 50/50 MF Property during 2016 and the addition of Jade Park with a physical occupancy that is lower than the average of other MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P81_S2	The overall increase in economic occupancy is a result of higher occupancy at the Suite on Paseo in 2017 as compared to 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P81_S3	This was somewhat offset by lower economic occupancy at The 50/50 due to the poor fall 2016 lease-up.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P81_S4	The overall decrease in economic occupancy from 2015 to 2016 is due declining occupancy at The 50/50 MF Property during 2016 and the addition of Jade Park with an economic occupancy that is lower than the average of other MF Properties.

1059142_18_ITEM7_P128_S4	The Partnership sold 161,383 BUCs under the program for net proceeds of approximately $806,000, net of issuance costs, during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P129_S0	Our principal uses of cash are (i) general, administrative and operating expenses, (ii) interest and principal payable on the unsecured and secured lines of credit, (iii) interest and principal payable on the debt financing and mortgages payable and other secured financing, and (iv) payment of distributions to Series A Preferred Unitholders and BUC holders.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P129_S1	We also use cash to acquire additional investments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P130_S0	The MF Properties primary uses of cash were for operating expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P130_S1	We also use cash for general and administrative expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P130_S2	For additional details, see Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 8, Cash Flows from Operating Activities section of the Company s consolidated statements of cash flows.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S0	We maintain two unsecured lines of credit: an operating and a revolving line of credit.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S1	Our operating line of credit allows for the advance of up to $10.0 million to be used for general operations.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S2	We are required to make prepayments of the principal to reduce outstanding principal balance on the operating line to zero for fifteen consecutive days during each calendar quarter.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S3	We fulfilled this requirement during the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S4	In addition, we have fulfilled this requirement for the first quarter of 2018.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S5	Our $50.0 million revolving line of credit may be utilized for the purchase of multifamily real estate and taxable or tax-exempt MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S6	Advances on the line of credit are due on the 270 th day following the advance date but may be extended by making certain payments for up to an additional 270 days.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S7	Our $20.0 million secured term line of credit was used to finance the purchase of MRBs and matured in March 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S8	The secured line of credit was closed and is not available for use by the Partnership at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S9	We anticipate paying off the balances on our revolving line of credit by entering into fixed-rate debt financing arrangements, to be secured with the previously acquired MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P131_S10	See Notes 15 and 16 of the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S0	Our debt financing arrangements consist of various secured financing transactions to leverage our portfolio of MRBs and other investments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S1	The financing arrangements generally involve the securitization of MRBs and other investments into trusts whereby we retain beneficial interests in the trusts that provide certain rights to the underlying investment assets.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S2	The remaining beneficial interests are sold to unaffiliated parties with the proceeds being received by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S3	The beneficial interests held by unaffiliated parties require periodic interest payments that may be fixed or variable, depending on the terms of the arrangement, and scheduled principal payments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S4	Our mortgages payable and other secured financing arrangements are used to leverage our MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S5	The mortgages and other secured financing are entered into with financial institutions and are secured by security interests in the MF Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S6	The mortgages and other secured financing bear interest that may be fixed or variable, depending on the terms of the arrangement, and scheduled principal payments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S7	We anticipate refinancing all financing arrangements coming due in 2018 with similar arrangements of terms greater than one year.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P132_S8	See Notes 17 and 18 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements for additional details on the maturity of the debt obligations at December 31, 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P133_S0	Distributions to the Series A Preferred Unitholders, if declared by the General Partner, are paid at a fixed rate of 3.0% annually.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P133_S1	The Series A Preferred Units are non-cumulative, non-voting and non-convertible.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P134_S0	Distributions to the BUC holders may increase or decrease at the determination of the General Partner.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P134_S1	The per Unit cash available for distribution primarily depends on the amount of interest and other cash received by us from our portfolio of MRBs and other investments, the amount of our outstanding debt and the effective interest rates paid by us on this debt, the level of operating and other cash expenses incurred by us, and the number of Units outstanding.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P135_S0	Leverage Ratio We utilize leverage to enhance rates of return to our Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P135_S1	We use target ratios for each type of financing obligation utilized by us to manage an overall leverage constraint, as established by the Board of Managers (the Board ) of Burlington, which is the general partner of the Partnership s general partner.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P135_S2	During the third quarter of 2017, the Board approved an increase in the overall leverage constraint to 75%.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P135_S3	The amount of leverage utilized is dependent upon several factors, including the assets being leveraged, the leverage program utilized, constraints of market collateral calls and the liquidity and marketability of the underlying collateral of the asset being leveraged.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P136_S0	We define our leverage ratio as total outstanding debt divided by total assets using the carrying value of the MRBs, PHC Certificates, initial finance costs and the MF Properties at cost.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P136_S1	At December 31, 2017, our overall leverage ratio was approximately 64%.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P137_S0	In fiscal 2017, we generated $48.8 million of cash, which was the net result of $17.1 million provided by operating activities, $21.5 million used in investing activities, and $53.2 million provided by financing activities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P138_S0	Cash provided by operating activities totaled $17.1 million in 2017, as compared to $15.2 million generated in 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P138_S1	The increase was mainly driven by a decrease in interest receivable of $2.2 million.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P139_S0	Cash used in investing activities totaled $21.5 million in 2017, as compared to $83.1 million in 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P139_S1	The change is due to an increase in principal payments and redemption proceeds received on MRBs of $45.3 million, a decrease in cash used to purchase MRBs of $9.3 million, and a decrease in property loan advances of $5.7 million.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P140_S0	Cash provided by financing activities totaled $53.2 million in 2017, as compared to $71.5 million in 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P140_S1	The change is due to a net increase in payments on lines of credit of $52.5 million.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P140_S2	This change is offset by an increase in net cash from debt financings of $18.5 million and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of Series A Preferred Units of $12.8 million.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P140_S3	We believe our cash balance and cash provided by the sources discussed herein will be sufficient to pay, or refinance, our debt obligations and to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P141_S0	The Partnership believes that CAD provides relevant information about the Partnership s operations and is necessary, along with net income, for understanding its operating results.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P142_S0	To calculate CAD, the Partnership begins with net income and adds back non-cash expenses consisting of amortization expense related to debt financing costs and bond issuance costs, interest rate derivative expense or income, provision for loan losses, impairments on MRBs, PHC Certificates, real estate assets and property loans, and Restricted Units compensation expense, to the Partnership s net income (loss) as computed in accordance with GAAP, and deducts Tier 2 income (see Note 3 to the Partnership s consolidated financial statements) attributable to the Partnership as defined in the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P143_S0	Net income is the GAAP measure most comparable to CAD.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P144_S0	There is no generally accepted methodology for computing CAD, and the Partnership s computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other companies.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P144_S1	Although the Partnership considers CAD to be a useful measure of the Partnership s operating performance, CAD is a non-GAAP measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, or any other measures of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P145_S0	Currently, cash distributions are made to the Partnership s Unitholders at an annual rate of $0.50 per Unit.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P145_S1	The amount of the cash per Unit distributed may increase or decrease at the determination of AFCA 2 based on its assessment of the amount of cash available for this purpose.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P145_S2	During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated Cash Available for Distribution of $0.60, $0.50 and $0.53 per Unit, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P145_S3	We believe that as we continue to implement our current investment plans, we will be able to continue to generate sufficient CAD to maintain cash distributions to Unitholders at the existing level of $0.50 per Unit per year without the use of other available cash.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P145_S4	However, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate CAD at levels in excess of the current annual distribution rate, which could result in a reduced annual distribution rate per Unit.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P146_S0	The following tables show the calculation of CAD (and a reconciliation of the Partnership s net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP to CAD) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P147_S0	As described in Note 3 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, Net Interest Income representing contingent interest and Net Residual Proceeds representing contingent interest (Tier 2 income) will be distributed 75% to the Unitholders and 25% to the General Partner.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P147_S1	This adjustment represents the 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2017, we realized contingent interest of approximately $219,000 from excess cash flow on the Lake Forest MRBs and approximately $2.9 million of cash proceeds from redemption of the Ashley Square MRB, which resulted in Tier 2 income allocable to the general partner of approximately $787,000.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S1	The remaining Tier 2 income allocated to the general partner was realized on the gains on sale of the Northern View, Residences of Weatherford, Residences of DeCordova and Eagle Village MF Properties, net of tax.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S2	The Amended and Restated LP Agreement limits Tier 2 income to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the MRBs and other investments on a cumulative basis.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S3	This limit was reached during the year ended December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S4	All income in excess of the limit is considered Tier 3 income that is allocated entirely to the BUCs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P148_S5	See Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P149_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized contingent interest of approximately $642,000 from excess cash flow on the Ashley Square and Lake Forest MRBs and approximately $1.4 million on settlement of the Foundation for Affordable Housing property loan, which resulted in Tier 2 income allocable to the general partner of approximately $505,000.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P149_S1	In addition, we realized gross gains of approximately $12.4 million and $1.7 million from the sales of the Arboretum and Woodland Park, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P149_S2	After consideration of income taxes, the gain on these sales resulted in approximately $2.4 million allocable to the general partner.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P150_S0	For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Consolidated VIEs were sold and we realized approximately $4.8 million of contingent interest and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner of approximately $1.2 million.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P150_S1	In addition, we reported the sale of Glynn Place and The Colonial which resulted in an approximately $1.2 million and $3.4 million gain, respectively, and 25% of Tier 2 income due to the General Partner is approximately $297,000 and $854,000, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P151_S0	The developer income amount represents cash received by us for developer and construction management services performed on The 50/50 Student Housing at UNL mixed-use project in Lincoln, Nebraska.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P151_S1	The development at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln is accounted for as an MF Property and the cash received for these fees has been eliminated within the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P151_S2	For purposes of CAD, we treat these fees as if received from an unconsolidated entity.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P152_S0	The table below identifies the composition of CAD per Unit earned by us for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
1059142_18_ITEM7_P153_S0	The non-recurring CAD per Unit reflects activity that will not recur within a two year period.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P154_S0	As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we held MRBs that are collateralized by Residential Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P154_S1	The Residential Properties are owned by entities that are not controlled by us.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P154_S2	We have no equity interest in these entities and do not guarantee any obligations of these entities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P155_S0	The Consolidated VIEs did not have off-balance sheet arrangements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P155_S1	For additional discussions related to guarantees, see Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P156_S0	We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P156_S1	As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P156_S2	We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties, other than what is disclosed in Note 24 to the Company s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P157_S0	Contractual Obligations As discussed in Notes 15 through 18 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, the amounts maturing in 2017 consist of the principal paid on LOCs, the TEBS credit facility with Freddie Mac, the TOB, Term TOB and Term A/B credit facilities with DB, and payments on the MF Property mortgages payable and other secured financing.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P157_S1	Our strategic objective is to leverage our MRB portfolio utilizing long-term securitization financings either with Freddie Mac through its TEBS program or with Deutsche Bank through its Term A/B Trust program.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P157_S2	This strategy allows us to better match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to better manage the spread between our assets and liabilities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P158_S0	As part of our strategy of acquiring MRBs, we will enter into bond purchase commitments related to MRBs to be issued and secured by properties under construction.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P158_S1	Upon execution of the bond purchase commitment, the proceeds from the MRBs issued will be used to pay off the construction related debt and MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P159_S0	We account for our Bond Purchase Commitments as available-for-sale securities and record the estimated fair value as an asset or liability with changes in such valuations recorded in other comprehensive income.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P159_S1	See Note 20 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for additional details.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P159_S2	We have the following contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:
1059142_18_ITEM7_P160_S0	We are also contractually obligated to pay interest on our long-term debt obligations.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P160_S1	The weighted average interest of our lines of credit is 4.4% at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P160_S2	The weighted average interest of our debt financing is 3.7% at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P160_S3	The weighted average interest of our mortgages payable and other secured financings is 4.2% at December 31, 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P161_S0	Inflation Substantially all of the resident leases at the Residential Properties, which collateralize our MRBs, allow for adjustments in the rent payable at the time of renewal, subject to rent restrictions related to the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P161_S1	Additionally, the MF Properties may be able to seek rent increases.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P161_S2	The majority of these leases are for one year or less.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P161_S3	The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the properties of the adverse effects of inflation; however, market conditions may prevent the properties from increasing rental rates in amounts sufficient to offset higher operating expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P162_S0	Inflation did not have a significant impact on our financial results for the years presented in this report.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P163_S0	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P163_S1	The application of these judgments, assumptions, and estimates can affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported by us.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P164_S0	Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 and 25 to the Company s consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P164_S1	We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies because they involve our judgments, assumptions and estimates that significantly affect the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P164_S2	If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S0	Variable Interest Entities Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must evaluate entities in which it holds a variable interest to determine if the entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) and if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S1	The entity that is deemed to have (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S2	If the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then it must consolidate the VIEs in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S3	The Company has consolidated all VIEs in which it has determined it is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S4	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S5	The Partnership re-evaluates VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P165_S6	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P166_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P166_S1	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership, the treatment of the MRBs on the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs as debt, the nature of the interest payments, which it believes to be tax-exempt, received on the MRBs secured by the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Form K-1.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P167_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs consists of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs since the applicable consolidation date.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P167_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the Amended and Restated LP Agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P168_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P169_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P170_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P171_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P171_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_18_ITEM7_P172_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P173_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P174_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P175_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P175_S1	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P176_S0	Investments in MRBs and Bond Purchase Commitments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P176_S1	The fair value of the Partnership s investments in MRBs and bond purchase commitments is based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market prices.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P176_S2	There is no active trading market for the MRBs and price quotes for the MRBs are not available.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P177_S0	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P177_S1	It considers the underlying characteristics of each MRB as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, legal structure of the borrower, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying property, geographic location, and property quality.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P177_S2	The MRB values are then estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P178_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third-party pricing service by comparing it to the Partnership s internal valuation methodology.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P178_S1	The Partnership s internal valuation methodology considers current market interest rates as well as quantitative and qualitative characteristics similar to those used by the third-party pricing service.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P178_S2	The fair value estimates of these MRBs, whether estimated by the third-party pricing service or the Partnership, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants and requires the use of judgment on the part of the third-party pricing service and management.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P178_S3	Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investments in MRBs and bond purchase commitments is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P179_S0	Investments in Public Housing Capital Fund Trust Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P180_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates is based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market prices.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P181_S0	There is no active trading market for the trusts certificates owned by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P182_S0	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P182_S1	It considers the underlying characteristics of each PHC Trust as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, security ratings from rating agencies, the impact of potential political and regulatory change, and other inputs.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P183_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third-party pricing service by comparing it to the Partnership s internal valuation methodology.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P184_S0	The Partnership s internal valuation methodology begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts, adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P185_S0	The valuation methodologies used by the third-party pricing service and the Partnership encompass the use of judgment in their application.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P185_S1	Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P185_S2	The fair value of the Partnership s taxable MRBs is based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market prices.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P185_S3	There is no active trading market for the taxable MRBs and price quotes are not available.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P186_S0	The valuation methodology of the Partnership s third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P186_S1	It considers the underlying characteristics of each taxable MRB as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, legal structure of the borrower, seniority to other obligations, operating results of the underlying property, geographic location, and property quality.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P186_S2	The taxable MRBs values are then estimated using a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analysis.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P187_S0	The Partnership analyzes pricing data received from the third-party pricing service by comparing it to the Partnership s internal valuation methodology.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P187_S1	The Partnership s internal valuation methodology considers current market interest rates as well as quantitative and qualitative characteristics like those used by the third-party pricing service.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P187_S2	The fair value estimates of these taxable MRBs, whether estimated by the third-party pricing service or the Partnership, are based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants and requires the use of judgment on the part of the third-party pricing service and management.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P187_S3	Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investments in taxable MRBs are categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P188_S0	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate derivatives is to set a cap, or upper limit, on the base rate of interest paid on the Partnership s variable rate debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P188_S1	The effect of the Partnership s interest rate swaps is to change a variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate for that portion of the debt equal to the notional amount of the derivative agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P189_S0	The fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on a model whose inputs are not observable and therefore is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P189_S1	The inputs in the valuation model include three-month London Inter-bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) rates, unobservable adjustments to account for the SIFMA index, as well as any recent interest rate cap trades with similar terms.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P190_S0	Impairment The Partnership accounts for its investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P190_S1	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P190_S2	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P190_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P190_S4	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value of mortgage revenue bonds, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P191_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each of its MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments for impairment.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P191_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary based on various factors including:
1059142_18_ITEM7_P192_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P193_S0	While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, if the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the security prior to the time that the value recovers or until maturity, and whether the Partnership expects to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P193_S1	The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P194_S0	If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio that could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P194_S1	PHC Certificates Impairment The Partnership periodically reviews the PHC Certificates for impairment.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P194_S2	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of the investments is below its amortized cost is other-than temporary based on various factors including:
1059142_18_ITEM7_P195_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P196_S0	The Partnership reviews real estate assets at least quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P196_S1	When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P196_S2	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P196_S3	See Note 9 for information on recognized impairment charges.
1059142_18_ITEM7_P196_S4	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements For a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P0_S0	Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental, monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations, and other factors beyond our control.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P0_S1	The nature of our MRBs, PHC Certificates and the debt financing used to finance these investments exposes us to financial risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P1_S0	The MRBs and PHC Certificates bear base interest at fixed rates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P1_S1	In addition, the MRBs may also pay contingent interest that fluctuates based upon the cash flows of the underlying property and proceeds from the refinancing or sale of the property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P2_S0	Our primary credit risk is the risk of default on our investment in MRBs and taxable property loans collateralized by the Residential Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P3_S0	The MRBs are not direct obligations of the governmental authorities that issue the MRBs and are not guaranteed by such authorities, any insurer or other party.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P3_S1	In addition, the MRBs and the associated taxable property loans are non-recourse obligations of the property owner.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P3_S2	As a result, the sole source of principal and interest payments (including both base and contingent interest) on the MRBs and the taxable property loans is the net rental revenues generated by these properties or the net proceeds from a sale or refinance of these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P4_S0	If a property is unable to sustain net rental revenues at a level necessary to pay current debt service obligations on our MRB or taxable property loans, a default may occur.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S0	A property s ability to generate net rental income is subject to a wide variety of factors, including rental and occupancy rates of the property and the level of its operating expenses.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S1	Occupancy rates and rents are directly affected by the supply of, and demand for, multifamily residential properties in the market area where the property is located.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S2	This is affected by several factors such as local or national economic conditions, the amount of new apartment construction and the affordability of single-family homes.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S3	In addition, factors such as government regulation (e.g. zoning laws), inflation, real estate and other taxes, labor problems, and natural disasters can affect the economic operations of a multifamily residential property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S4	We also have credit risk in our investment in PHC Certificates, which are custodial receipts evidencing loans made to a number of public housing authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S5	Principal and interest on these loans are payable by the respective public housing authorities solely out of annual appropriations to be made to the public housing authorities by HUD under HUD s Capital Fund Program.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S6	If Congress fails to continue making annual appropriations for the Capital Fund Program at or near current levels, or there is a delay in the approval of appropriations, the public housing authorities may not have funds to pay principal and interest on the loans underlying the PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S7	Defaults on the MRBs, taxable property loans, or the public housing authorities loans backing the PHC Certificates may reduce the amount of future cash available for distribution to Unitholders.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S8	In addition, if a property s net rental income declines, it may affect the market value of the property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S9	If the market value of a property deteriorates, the amount of net proceeds from the ultimate sale or refinancing of the property may be insufficient to repay the entire principal balance of the MRB or taxable property loan secured by the property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S10	In the event of a default on a MRB or taxable property loan, we will have the right to foreclose on the mortgage or deed of trust securing the property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S11	If we take ownership of the property securing a defaulted MRB, we will be entitled to all net rental revenues generated by the property.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P5_S12	If such an event occurs, these amounts will not provide tax-exempt income.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P6_S0	We actively manage the credit risks associated with our MRBs and taxable property loans by performing a complete due diligence and underwriting process of the properties securing these investments prior to investing.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P6_S1	In addition, we carefully monitor the performance of the properties underlying these investments subsequent to their purchase by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P7_S0	Our primary method of managing the credit risk associated with the PHC Certificates is to monitor the ratings reports issued at least annually by a rating agency for each of three PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P7_S1	Mortgage Revenue Bonds and PHC Certificate Sensitivity Analysis A third-party pricing service is used to value our MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P7_S2	The pricing service uses a discounted cash flow and yield to maturity or call analyses which encompasses judgment in its application.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P8_S0	The key assumption in the yield to maturity or call analysis is the range of effective yields of the individual MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P8_S1	The effective yield analysis for each MRB considers the current market yield on similar MRBs, specific terms of the MRB, and various characteristics of underlying property serving as collateral for the MRB such as debt service coverage ratio, loan to value, and other characteristics.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P9_S0	We value the PHC Certificates based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market prices.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P10_S0	There is no active trading market for the PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P11_S0	The valuation methodology of our third-party pricing service incorporates commonly used market pricing methods.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P11_S1	It considers the underlying characteristics of each PHC Trust as well as other quantitative and qualitative characteristics including, but not limited to, market interest rates, security ratings from rating agencies, the impact of potential political and regulatory change, and other inputs.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P12_S0	The fair value estimate by the third-party pricing service encompasses the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P13_S0	We completed a sensitivity analysis which is hypothetical and is as of a specific point in time.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P13_S1	The results of the sensitivity analysis may not be indicative of actual changes in fair value and should be used with caution.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P13_S2	The table below summarizes the sensitivity analysis metrics related to the investments in the MRBs and PHC Certificates at December 31, 2017:
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P14_S0	The properties securing the Partnership s MRBs are geographically dispersed throughout the United States, with significant concentrations (geographic risk) in Texas, California and South Carolina.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P14_S1	At December 31, 2017, and 2016, the concentration in Texas as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 44% and 45%, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P14_S2	At December 31, 2017, and 2016, the concentration in California as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 20% and 20%, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P14_S3	At December 31, 2017, and 2016, the concentration in South Carolina as a percentage of principal outstanding was approximately 16% and 12%, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P15_S0	Summary of Interest Rates on Borrowings and Interest Rate Cap Agreements At December 31, 2017, the total costs of borrowing by investment type were as follows:
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P16_S0	The mortgages payable and other secured financings range between 3.9% and 4.7%.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P17_S0	We enter into interest rate cap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the variable rate financing facilities.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P17_S1	The following table sets forth certain information regarding the Partnership s interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2017:
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P18_S0	(1) For additional details, see Note 25 to the Partnership's condensed consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P19_S0	We have contracted for two interest rate swaps with DB.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P20_S0	On a quarterly basis, the Partnership reassesses its interest rate swap positions.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P20_S1	In the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership determined that due to the stabilization of the Decatur Angle and Bruton MRB properties and securitization of the related MRBs into fixed rate Term A/B Trust financings, the interest rate swaps were not needed to mitigate interest rate risk on financings related to the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P20_S2	The Partnership then determined that the interest rate swaps are intended to mitigate interest rate risk for the variable rate PHC TOB Trusts.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P20_S3	The following table summarizes the terms of the interest rate swaps at December 31, 2017:
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P21_S0	These interest rate derivatives and interest rate swaps are not designated as hedging instruments and, accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in current period earnings as interest expense.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P21_S1	See Note 25 for a description of the methodology and significant assumptions for determining the fair value of the interest rate derivatives and interest rate swap arrangements.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P22_S0	The following table sets forth information regarding the impact on the Partnership s income assuming a change in interest rates:
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P23_S0	The interest rate sensitivity table ( Table ) represents the change in interest income from investments net of interest on debt and interest rate derivative expenses over the next twelve months, assuming an immediate parallel shift in the LIBOR yield curve and the resulting implied forward rates are realized as a component of this shift in the curve.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P23_S1	Assumptions include anticipated interest rates, relationships between interest rate indices and outstanding investments, liabilities and interest rate derivative positions.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P23_S2	No assurance can be made that the assumptions included in the Table presented herein will occur or that other events would not occur that would affect the outcomes of the analysis.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P23_S3	Furthermore, the results included in the Table assume the Partnership does not act to change its sensitivity to the movement in interest rates.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P24_S0	As the above information incorporates only those material positions or exposures that existed as of December 31, 2017, it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date.
1059142_18_ITEM7A_P24_S1	The ultimate economic impact of these market risks will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our risk mitigation strategies at that time and the overall business and economic environment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P0_S0	To the Board of Managers and Partners of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P1_S0	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and its subsidiaries (the Company ) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, partners capital and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P1_S1	We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P2_S0	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P2_S1	Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P3_S0	The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P3_S1	Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P3_S2	We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P4_S0	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P4_S1	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S0	Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S1	Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S2	Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S3	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S4	Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P5_S5	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P6_S0	A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P6_S1	A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P7_S0	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P7_S1	Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P8_S0	We have served as the Company s auditor since 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P9_S0	To the Board of Directors and Partners of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. Omaha, Nebraska We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), partners capital, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P9_S1	These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P9_S2	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P9_S3	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P9_S4	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S0	An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S1	An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S2	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S3	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S4	As discussed in Notes 6, 7, and 25, the consolidated financial statements include total investments valued at approximately $655,000,000 (75% of total assets) and $521,000,000 (70% of total assets) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, whose fair values have been estimated by management in the absence of readily determinable fair values.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S5	At December 31, 2015, management s estimates were based on discounted cash flows or yield to maturity analyses performed by management.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P10_S6	As discussed in Notes 17 and 26 to the consolidated financial statements, the accompanying 2015 consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for a segment change and the adoption of guidance related to the presentation of deferred financing costs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P11_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P12_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P13_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P14_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P15_S0	The accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P16_S0	Basis of Presentation America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. (the Company or Partnership ) was formed on April 2, 1998, under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act for the purpose of acquiring, holding, selling and otherwise dealing with a portfolio of mortgage revenue bonds ( MRBs ) that have been issued to provide construction and/or permanent financing for affordable multifamily and student housing residential properties (collectively Residential Properties ) and commercial properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P16_S1	The Partnership expects and believes the interest earned on these mortgage revenue bonds is excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P19_S0	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Consolidation The Partnership, as used herein, includes the Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P19_S1	At December 31, 2017, the consolidated subsidiaries of the Partnership ( Consolidated Subsidiaries ) consist of:
1059142_18_ITEM8_P20_S0	ATAX TEBS I, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created to hold MRBs to facilitate the TEBS Financing ( M24 TEBS Financing ) with Freddie Mac.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P21_S0	ATAX TEBS II, LLC, a special purpose entity owned and controlled by the Partnership, created to hold MRBs to facilitate the second TEBS financing ( M31 TEBS Financing ) with Freddie Mac.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P23_S0	ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, committed to loan money or provide equity for the development of multifamily properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P24_S0	One MF Property is owned by a wholly-owned corporation ( the Greens Hold Co ).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P24_S1	Property until its sale in March 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P24_S2	The Greens Hold Co held 100% ownership interest in the Eagle Village, Residences of DeCordova and Residences of Weatherford MF Properties until their sale in November 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P25_S0	Two MF Properties are owned directly by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P26_S0	Prior to January 1, 2016, the Partnership has consolidated two variable interest entities ( VIE ), Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks properties (the Consolidated VIEs ), in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P26_S1	The Partnership did not hold an ownership interest in the Consolidated VIEs but did own the MRBs that financed the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P27_S0	The Consolidated VIEs are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and all significant transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P28_S0	The Company s consolidated financial statements reported in this Form 10-K include the financial position and results of operations of the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P28_S1	The Consolidated VIEs were sold in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S0	Variable Interest Entities Under the consolidation guidance, the Partnership must evaluate entities in which it holds a variable interest to determine if the entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) and if the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S1	The entity that is deemed to have (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE, is considered the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S2	If the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, then it must consolidate the VIEs in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S3	The Company has consolidated all VIEs in which it has determined it is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S4	In the Company s consolidated financial statements, all transactions and accounts between the Partnership and the Consolidated VIEs have been eliminated in consolidation.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S5	The Partnership re-evaluates VIEs at each reporting date based on events and circumstances at the VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P29_S6	As a result, changes to the Consolidated VIEs may occur in the future based on changes in circumstances.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P30_S0	The accounting guidance on consolidations is complex and requires significant analysis and judgment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P30_S1	The General Partner does not believe that the consolidation of VIEs for reporting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) impacts the Partnership s status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or the status of Unitholders as partners of the Partnership, the treatment of the MRBs on the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs as debt, the nature of the interest payments, which it believes to be tax-exempt, received on the MRBs secured by the properties owned by Consolidated VIEs or the manner in which the Partnership s income is reported to Unitholders on IRS Form K-1.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P31_S0	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs consists of the accumulated historical net losses of the Consolidated VIEs since the applicable consolidation date.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P31_S1	The unallocated deficit of the Consolidated VIEs and the Consolidated VIEs net losses subsequent to that date are not allocated to the General Partner and Unitholders as such activity is not contemplated by, or addressed in, the First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated September 15, 2015, as amended (the Amended and Restated LP Agreement ).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P31_S2	The Partnership sold its variable interests in Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks (the Consolidated VIEs) in the fourth quarter of 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P31_S3	The sale of the Consolidated VIEs met the criteria for discontinued operations presentation and have been classified as such in the Company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P31_S4	The gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs are reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 (see Notes 14).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P32_S0	Acquisition Accounting Pursuant to the guidance on acquisition accounting, the Partnership allocates the contractual purchase price of a property acquired to the land, building, improvements and leases in existence as of the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P32_S1	The building is valued as if vacant.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P33_S0	The estimated valuation of in-place leases is calculated by applying a risk-adjusted discount rate to the projected cash flow deficit at each property during an assumed lease-up period for these properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P33_S1	This allocated cost is amortized over the average remaining term of the leases and is included in the statement of operations under depreciation and amortization expense.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P34_S0	The acquisition related costs to acquire a property are expensed as incurred.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S0	Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid securities and investments in federally tax-exempt securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S1	Concentration of Credit Risk The Partnership maintains the majority of its unrestricted cash balances at three financial institutions.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S2	The balances insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are equal to $250,000 at each institution.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S3	At various times the cash balances exceeded the $250,000 limit.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S4	The Partnership is also exposed to risk on its short-term investments in the event of non-performance by counterparties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S5	The Partnership does not anticipate any non-performance.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P35_S6	This risk is minimized significantly by the Partnership s portfolio being restricted to investment grade securities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S0	Restricted Cash Restricted cash is legally restricted to use and is comprised of resident security deposits, required maintenance reserves, escrowed funds, and property rehabilitation.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S1	In addition, the Partnership is required to maintain restricted cash balances related to the TEBS Financing facilities and the Partnership s interest rate derivatives.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S2	The Partnership accounts for its investments in MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S3	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S4	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S5	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the bonds, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P36_S6	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value of mortgage revenue bonds, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P37_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews each of its MRBs, taxable MRBs and bond purchase commitments for impairment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P37_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether unrealized losses are considered other-than-temporary based on various factors including:
1059142_18_ITEM8_P38_S0	Recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P39_S0	While the Partnership evaluates all available information, it focuses specifically on whether the security s estimated fair value is below amortized cost, if the Partnership has the intent to sell or may be required to sell the security prior to the time that the value recovers or until maturity, and whether the Partnership expects to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P39_S1	The recognition of other-than-temporary impairment and the potential impairment analysis are subject to a considerable degree of judgment, the results of which when applied under different conditions or assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P40_S0	If the Partnership experiences deterioration in the values of its investment portfolio, the Partnership may incur impairments to its investment portfolio that could negatively impact the Partnership s financial condition, cash flows, and reported earnings.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P40_S1	There were no impairment charges reported by the Partnership related to MRBs, taxable MRBs or bond purchase commitments during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P41_S0	The Partnership owns some MRBs which were purchased at a discount or premium.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P41_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method over the term of the related MRB and is recognized as investment income in the current period.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P41_S2	The Partnership eliminates the MRBs and the associated interest income and interest receivable when it consolidates the underlying real estate collateral in accordance with implementation of the consolidation guidance for VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S0	Investment in PHC Certificates and MBS Securities The Partnership accounts for its investments in PHC Certificates under the guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S1	The Partnership s investments in these instruments are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at estimated fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S2	The net unrealized gains or losses on these investments is reflected in other comprehensive income.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S3	Unrealized gains and losses do not affect the cash flow of the underlying contractual payments, distributions to Unitholders, or the characterization of the interest income of the financial obligation of the underlying collateral.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S4	See Note 25 for a description of the Partnership s methodology for estimating fair value for the PHC Certificates and MBS Securities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P42_S5	The Partnership sold its remaining MBS Securities in the first quarter of 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P43_S0	The Partnership periodically reviews the PHC Certificates and MBS Securities for impairment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P43_S1	The Partnership evaluates whether a decline in the fair value of the investments is below its amortized cost is other-than temporary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P44_S0	Volatility of the fair value of the security.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P45_S0	See Note 7 for information on recognized impairment of the PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P46_S0	The PHC Certificate Trust I was purchased at a premium and PHC Certificate Trusts II and III were purchased at a discount.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P46_S1	The discount or premium on an investment is amortized on an effective yield method over the term of the related PHC Certificate and is recognized as investment income in the current period.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P47_S0	Real Estate Assets The Partnership s investments in real estate are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P47_S1	Depreciation of real estate is based on the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally 19-40 years on multifamily, student housing, and senior citizen residential apartment buildings and five to 15 years on capital improvements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P47_S2	Depreciation expenses is calculated using the straight-line method.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P47_S3	Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, while improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P47_S4	The Partnership also holds land held for investment and development which is reported at cost.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P48_S0	The Partnership recognizes gains and losses equal to the difference between proceeds on sale and the net carrying value of the assets at the date of disposition.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P48_S1	The Partnership reviews real estate assets at least quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P48_S2	When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of the real estate assets may not be recoverable, the Partnership compares the carrying amount to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use of the assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P48_S3	If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P48_S4	See Note 9 for information on recognized impairment charges.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S0	Investment in Unconsolidated Entities The Partnership makes initial investments in and is committed to invest, through ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC, in certain limited liability companies ( Vantage Properties ).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S1	ATAX Vantage Holdings, LLC holds a limited membership interest in the Vantage Properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S2	The investments will be used to construct multifamily properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S3	The Partnership does not have a controlling interest in the Vantage Properties and accounts for its limited partnership interest under the equity method of accounting.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S4	The Partnership earns a return on its investment that is guaranteed by an unrelated third party.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P49_S5	The term of third-party guarantee is from initial investment date through the second anniversary of construction completion.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P50_S0	Due to the third-party guarantee provided, cash flows are expected to be sufficient to pay the Partnership its earned return.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P50_S1	As a result, the Partnership records the return on the investment earned as investment income in the Partnership s consolidated statements of operations (Note 10).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P51_S0	The Partnership reviews its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully recoverable.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P51_S1	Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary includes, but is not limited to, the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount of the investment, or, where applicable, estimated sales proceeds that are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P51_S2	The Partnership s assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on its ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P51_S3	If the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the investment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P52_S0	The Partnership invests in taxable property loans made to the owners of certain multifamily properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P52_S1	Most of the property loans are with multifamily properties that secure MRBs owned by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P52_S2	The Partnership recognizes interest income on the property loans as earned and is reported within other interest income on the consolidated statements of operations.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P52_S3	Interest income is not recognized for property loans that are deemed to be in nonaccrual status.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P53_S0	largely on the value of the property or its cash flows that collateralize the loans.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P53_S1	The Partnership periodically evaluates these loans for potential losses by estimating the fair value of the property that collateralizes the loans and comparing the fair value to the outstanding MRBs or senior financing plus the Partnership s property loans.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P54_S0	The Partnership utilizes a discounted cash flow model ( DCF ) that considers varying assumptions.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P54_S1	The DCF analysis may assume multiple revenue and expense scenarios, various capitalization rates, and multiple discount rates.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P54_S2	The Partnership may also consider other information such as independent appraisals in estimating a property s fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P54_S3	If the estimated fair value of the property, after deducting the amortized cost basis of the MRB or senior financing, exceeds the principal balance of the taxable property loan then no potential loss is indicated and no allowance for loan loss is recorded.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P54_S4	If a potential loss is indicated, an allowance for loan loss is recorded against the outstanding loan amount and a loss is realized.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P55_S0	The determination of the need for an allowance for loan loss is subject to considerable judgment.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P55_S1	See Note 11 for additional information on the Partnership s loan loss allowances.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P56_S0	Assets Held for Sale The Partnership reports assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet in the period that the Partnership has committed to a plan to dispose of an asset or asset group, the asset or asset group is being marketed for sale, and it is probable the sale will be completed within one year.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P56_S1	Once an asset or asset group is determined to be held for sale, the Partnership discontinues depreciation of the asset or asset group.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P56_S2	The Partnership has evaluated the accounting guidance related its TOB, Term TOB, Term A/B and TEBS Financings and has determined that the securitization transactions do not meet the accounting criteria for a sale or transfer of financial assets and will, therefore, be accounted for as secured financing transactions.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P56_S3	More specifically, the guidance on transfers and servicing sets forth the conditions that must be met to de-recognize a transferred financial asset.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P56_S4	This guidance provides, in part, that the transferor has surrendered control over transferred assets if and only if the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P57_S0	The financing agreements contain certain provisions that allow the Partnership to unilaterally cause the holder to return the securitized assets, other than through a cleanup call.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P57_S1	Based on these terms, the Partnership has concluded that it has not transferred effective control over the transferred assets and, as such, the transactions do not meet the conditions to de-recognize the transferred assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P57_S2	In addition, the Partnership has evaluated the securitization trusts associated with the TOB, Term TOB, Term A/B and TEBS Financings in accordance with guidance on consolidation of VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P57_S3	See Note 5 for the consolidation analysis related to these secured financing arrangements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P57_S4	The Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts and consolidates the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the securitization trusts in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P58_S0	Deferred Financing Costs Debt financing costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method through either the stated maturity or the optional redemption of the related debt financing agreement.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P58_S1	Debt financing costs associated with revolving line of credit arrangements are reported within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P58_S2	Debt financing costs for other debt financings are reported as reductions to the carrying value of the related debt financings on the consolidated balance sheets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P59_S0	Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized utilizing the effective interest method over the stated maturity of the related MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P59_S1	Bond issuance costs are reported as an adjustment to the carrying cost of the related MRB on the consolidated balance sheets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P60_S0	Income Taxes No provision has been made for income taxes of the Partnership because the Unitholders are required to report their share of the Partnership s taxable income for federal and state income tax purposes, except for certain entities described below.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P61_S0	The Partnership recognizes franchise margin tax expense on revenues in certain jurisdictions relating to MF Properties and Investments in unconsolidated entities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P61_S1	Certain of the Consolidated VIEs and The Greens Hold Co are corporations subject to federal and state income taxes.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P61_S2	The Partnership will recognize income tax expense or benefit for the federal and state income taxes incurred by these entities on the Partnership s consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S0	The Partnership evaluates its tax positions taken in the Partnership s consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S1	As such, the Partnership may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Partnership believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S2	The Partnership accrues interest and penalties as incurred within income tax expense.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S3	and the utilization of tax net operating losses ( NOL ) generated in prior years that had been previously recognized as deferred income tax assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S4	The Partnership fully utilized its NOL carryforwards during 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S5	The Partnership values its deferred tax assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse, and reflects changes to enacted rates contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was signed into law in December 2017.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S6	The Partnership records a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets if it believes all, or some portion, of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P62_S7	Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances that causes a change in the estimated ability to realize the related deferred income tax asset is included in deferred income tax expense.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P63_S0	The interest income received by the Partnership from its MRBs is dependent upon the net cash flow of the underlying properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P63_S1	Base interest income on fully performing MRBs is recognized as it is earned.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P63_S2	Base interest income on MRBs not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P63_S3	Past due base interest on MRBs previously not fully performing is recognized as it is received.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P63_S4	The Partnership reinstates the accrual of base interest once the MRBs ability to perform is adequately demonstrated.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P64_S0	Base interest income related to tax-exempt and taxable MRBs are disclosed within investment income and other interest income, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P65_S0	Certain MRBs contain contingent interest provisions that generate excess available cash flow.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P69_S1	The Series A Preferred Units are recorded as mezzanine equity due to the holders redemption option which, if and when the units become subject to redemption, is outside the Partnership s control.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P69_S2	In addition, the costs of issuing the Series A Preferred Units are netted against the carrying value and amortized to the first redemption date (Note 21).

1059142_18_ITEM8_P71_S1	RUAs are generally granted with vesting conditions ranging from three months to up to three years.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P71_S2	RUAs currently provide for the payment of distributions during the restriction period.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P71_S3	The RUAs provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control or upon death or disability of the Participant.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P72_S0	The Partnership accounts for forfeitures when they occur.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P72_S1	The fair value of each RUA is estimated on the grant date based on the Partnership s exchange-listed closing price of the BUCs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P72_S2	The Partnership recognizes compensation expense for the RUAs on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P72_S3	The Partnership accounts for modifications to RUAs as they occur if the fair value of the RUAs change, there are changes to vesting conditions or the awards no longer qualify for equity classification.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P73_S0	Net Income per BUC The Partnership uses the two-class method to allocate net income available to BUCs and the unvested Restricted Units as the Restricted Units are participating securities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P73_S1	Unvested Restricted Units are included with BUCs for the calculation of diluted net income per BUC using the treasury stock method, if the treasury stock method is more dilutive than the two-class method.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P74_S1	Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P74_S2	The most significant estimates and assumptions include those used in determining investment valuations, investment impairments, impairment of real estate assets, allocation of the purchase price for acquisition accounting and allowances for loan losses.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P74_S3	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P75_S2	The amendments provide a screen to determine when a set of identifiable assets and liabilities is not a business.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P75_S3	The screen requires that when substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P75_S4	The impact is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P75_S5	The ASU is effective for the Partnership for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and is applied prospectively.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P75_S6	It is expected that the new standard would reduce the number of future real estate acquisitions that will be accounted for as business combinations and, therefore, reduce the amount of acquisition costs that will be expensed.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P82_S1	Lessor arrangements with tenants at the MF Properties are not expected to be materially impacted by adoption of the standard as substantially all leases are for terms of 12 months or less.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P83_S0	The Partnership has four lessee arrangements for which it is assessing the quantitative and qualitative impact of the standard.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P83_S1	The Partnership has not elected early adoption of the standard and is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P84_S0	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10).

1059142_18_ITEM8_P85_S0	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P85_S1	The updated standard is a new comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S0	In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S2	The Partnership expects to use the modified retrospective transition method and will adopt the standard effective January 1, 2018.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S3	The Partnership has completed an assessment of its revenue streams and performance obligations and is currently evaluating the quantitative and qualitative impacts of the new standard on the business.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S4	The Partnership has determined that revenues within investment income, contingent interest income, other interest income are not within the scope of this standard.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S5	Furthermore, the majority of property revenues are within the scope of the Lease ASU and outside the scope of the Revenue ASU.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S6	The Partnership believes the new standard will only impact property revenues related to non-lease revenue streams, other income, and certain provisions that apply to gains on sale of real estate assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P86_S7	The impact to non-lease revenue streams within the scope of this standard is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S0	In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-05.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S1	The ASU eliminates guidance specific to real estate sales in Accounting Standards Codification 360-20.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S2	As such, sales and partial sales of real estate assets will now be subject to the same derecognition model as all other nonfinancial assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S3	The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S4	The effective date of this guidance coincides with revenue recognition guidance.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P87_S5	The Partnership has determined adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P88_S0	The Amended and Restated LP Agreement of the Partnership contains provisions for the distribution of Net Interest Income, Net Residual Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, for the allocation of income or loss from operations and for the allocation of income and loss arising from a repayment, sale, or liquidation of investments.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P88_S1	Income and losses will be allocated to each Unitholder on a periodic basis, as determined by the General Partner, based on the number of BUCs held by each Unitholder as of the last day of the period for which such allocation is to be made.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P88_S2	Distributions of Net Interest Income and Net Residual Proceeds will be made to each Unitholder of record on the last day of each distribution period based on the number of BUCs held by each Unitholder on that date.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P89_S2	Cash distributions are currently made on a quarterly basis.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P89_S3	AFCA 2 can elect to make distributions on a monthly or semi-annual basis.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P89_S4	On each distribution date, Net Interest Income (Tier 1) is distributed 99% to the limited partners and Unitholders as a class and 1% to AFCA 2.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P89_S5	Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2) representing contingent interest up to 0.9% per annum of the principal amount of the MRBs on a cumulative basis are distributed 75% to the limited partners and Unitholders as a class and 25% to AFCA 2.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P89_S6	Net Interest Income (Tier 3) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 3) received by the Partnership in excess of any contingent interest included in Net Interest Income (Tier 2) and Net Residual Proceeds (Tier 2) are distributed 100% to the limited partners and Unitholders as a class.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P91_S2	There were no dilutive Units for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P92_S0	Variable Interest Entities Consolidated VIEs The capital structure of Bent Tree and Fairmont Oaks (the Consolidated VIEs ) consisted of senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity capital.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P92_S1	The senior debt was in the form of a MRB and accounts for the majority of the total capital of each VIE.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P92_S2	As the bondholder, the Partnership was entitled to principal and interest payments and has certain protective rights as established by the MRB documents.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S0	The equity ownership in these entities is ultimately held by corporations which are owned by three individuals, one of which is a related party to the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S1	Additionally, each of these properties was managed by an affiliate of the Partnership, Properties Management, which is an affiliate of Burlington.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S2	The Partnership determined it was the primary beneficiary of the Consolidated VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S3	The Consolidated VIEs were sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the gains and results of operations of the Consolidated VIEs reported as part of the discontinued operations in net income for all periods presented.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S4	No net income or loss from these properties operations or sale accrued to the Unitholders or the General Partner during 2017, 2016 and 2015.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S5	The Partnership determined the TOB Trusts, Term A/B Trusts and TEBS Financings are VIEs and the Partnership is the primary beneficiary.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P93_S6	In determining the primary beneficiary of these specific VIEs, the Partnership considered which party has the power to control the activities of the VIEs which most significantly impact their financial performance, the risks that the entity was designed to create, and how each risk affects the VIE.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P94_S0	The executed agreements related to the TOB Trusts, Term A/B Trusts and TEBS Financings stipulate the Partnership has the sole right to cause the Trusts to sell the underlying assets.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P94_S1	If they were sold, the extent to which the VIEs will be exposed to gains or losses would result from decisions made by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P95_S0	As the primary beneficiary, the Partnership reports the TOB Trusts, Term A/B Trusts and TEBS Financings on a consolidated basis.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P95_S1	The Partnership reports the senior floating-rate participation interests ( SPEARS ) related to the TOB Trusts and the Class A Certificates for both the Term A/B Trusts and TEBS Financings as secured debt financings on the consolidated balance sheets (Note 17).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P95_S2	The MRBs secured by the TOB Trusts, Term A/B Trusts and TEBS Financings are reported as assets on the consolidated balance sheets (Note 6).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P96_S0	Non-Consolidated VIEs The Partnership has variable interests in various entities in the form of MRBs, property loans and investments in unconsolidated entities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P96_S1	These variable interests do not allow the Partnership to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of such VIEs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P96_S2	As a result, the Partnership is not considered the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate the financial statements of these VIEs in the consolidated financial statements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P96_S3	The Partnership held variable interest in 23 and 20 non-consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P96_S4	The following table summarizes the Partnerships variable interests in these entities at December 31, 2017 and 2016:
1059142_18_ITEM8_P97_S0	The maximum exposure to loss for the MRBs is equal to the cost adjusted for paydowns at December 31, 2017 and 2016.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P97_S1	The difference between a MRB s carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets and the maximum exposure to loss is a function of the unrealized gains or losses on the MRB.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P98_S0	The maximum exposure to loss on the property loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is equal to the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P98_S1	The difference between a property loans carrying value and the maximum exposure is the value of loan loss allowances that have been recorded against the property loans.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P99_S0	Investments in Mortgage Revenue Bonds The Partnership owns MRBs that were issued by various state and local governments, their agencies and authorities to finance the construction or rehabilitation of income-producing real estate properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P99_S1	However, the MRBs do not constitute an obligation of any state or local government, agency or authority and no state or local government, agency or authority is liable on them, nor is the taxing power of any state or local government pledged to the payment of principal or interest on the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P99_S2	The MRBs are non-recourse obligations of the respective owners of the properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P99_S3	The sole source of the funds to pay principal and interest on the MRBs is the net cash flow or the sale or refinancing proceeds from the properties.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P100_S0	Each MRB is collateralized by a mortgage on all real and personal property included in the related property.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P100_S1	The MRBs bear interest at a fixed rate and two of the mortgage revenue bonds provide for the payment of additional contingent interest that is payable from available net cash flow generated by the related property.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P101_S0	The following tables present information regarding the mortgage revenue bonds owned by the Partnership as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:
1059142_18_ITEM8_P102_S0	See Note 25 for a description of the methodology and significant assumptions for determining the fair value of the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P103_S0	Unrealized gains or losses on the MRBs are recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to reflect changes in their estimated fair values resulting from market conditions and fluctuations in the present value of the expected cash flows from the MRBs.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P104_S0	Redemptions: The following MRBs were redeemed at prices that approximated the Partnership s carrying value plus accrued interest.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P105_S7	In December 2017, the Heights at 515 MRBs were restructured.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P105_S8	The $510,000 of principal outstanding on the Heights at 515 - Series B MRB was collapsed into the Series A MRB and the Series B MRB was eliminated.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P105_S9	No cash was paid or received on restructuring.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P105_S10	The terms of the Series B MRB that was eliminated are as follows:

1059142_18_ITEM8_P107_S0	Restructurings: During 2016, six of the Partnership s MRBs relating to three properties were restructured.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P107_S1	For each property, the Series B mortgage revenue bond was redeemed, and the outstanding principal balance was added to the outstanding principal on the Series A MRBs.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P108_S1	The Partnership used approximately $8.4 million of the proceeds from the sale to pay in full and collapse the Term TOB Trust securitizing this MRB (Note 17).
1059142_18_ITEM8_P108_S2	The terms of the Pro Nova 2014-2 MRB redeemed are as follows:

1059142_18_ITEM8_P217_S0	Fair Value of Financial Instruments Current accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides for expanded disclosures about fair value measurements.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P218_S0	Establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability on the measurement date.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P219_S0	Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P220_S0	To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P220_S1	The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
1059142_18_ITEM8_P221_S0	Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P222_S0	Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P223_S0	Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for asset or liabilities.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P224_S0	The categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P224_S1	Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P225_S0	The fair value of the Partnership s investments in MRBs and bond purchase commitments at December 31, 2017 is based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market prices.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P228_S6	The estimates of the fair values of these MRBs, whether estimated by the Partnership or based on external sources, were based largely on unobservable inputs the Partnership believed would be used by market participants.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P228_S7	Additionally, the calculation methodology used by the external sources and the Partnership encompassed the use of judgment in its application.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P228_S8	To validate changes in the fair value of the Partnership s investments in MRBs between reporting periods, the Partnership looked at the key inputs such as changes in the A rated municipal bond rates on similar MRBs as well as changes in the operating performance of the underlying property serving as collateral for each MRB.

1059142_18_ITEM8_P234_S0	The Partnership s internal valuation methodology utilized the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts, adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P234_S1	During the third quarter of 2017, the Partnership continued to utilize the third-party pricing service to obtain prices, which are indicative of market prices, for its PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P234_S2	The Partnership engaged a second third-party pricing service whose methodology was consistent with the Partnership s internal valuation methodology and is utilized by the Partnership to confirm the values developed by its primary third-party pricing service.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P234_S3	As such, the Partnership did not utilize its internal methodology to price the PHC Certificates.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P234_S4	The Partnership reviews the inputs used by the primary third-party pricing service by reviewing source information and reviews the methodology for reasonableness.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P235_S0	The valuation methodologies used by the third-party pricing services and the Partnership encompass the use of judgment in their application.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P235_S1	Due to the judgments involved, the fair value measurement of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates is categorized as a Level 3 input.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P235_S2	At December 31, 2017, the range of effective yields on the PHC Certificates was 5.1% to 5.8% per annum.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P235_S3	The fair value of the Partnership s investment in PHC Certificates at December 31, 2016 was based on a yield to maturity analysis performed by the Partnership.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P236_S0	The Partnership s valuation methodology begins with the current market yield rate for a AAA rated tax-free municipal bond for a term consistent with the weighted-average life of each of the Public Housing Capital Fund trusts, adjusted largely for unobservable inputs the Partnership believes would be used by market participants.
1059142_18_ITEM8_P236_S1	The Partnership validates that the changes in the estimated fair value of PHC Certificates move with the changes in the market yield rates of investment grade rated mortgage revenue municipal bonds with terms of similar length.
